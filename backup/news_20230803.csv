Some of the most notable things that have been going on for the cryptocurrency include the multiple exchange-traded funds (ETFs) filings that have been made to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). When Will An Ethereum ETF Be Approved? The topic of Ethereum futures ETFs has become hotter especially after Bitcoin futures ETFs received multiple approvals from the SEC since 2021. However, even two years after the first Bitcoin futures ETF was approved, the regulator is still yet to approve an Ethereum futures ETF. Related Reading: Litecoin Sharks Buy More Than 200,000 LTC Ahead Of Wednesday’s Halving Despite this, investment firms have remained undeterred as they have continued to file for Ethereum futures ETFs. As reported by NewsBTC, there are now a total of six ETH futures ETF filings with the SEC after Grayscale refiled its application with the regulator. In addition to Grayscale, VanEck, ProShares, Volatility Shares, Bitwise, and Roundhill all have pending applications with the commission. With so many interested applications, there is now mounting pressure on the SEC to approve the first Ethereum futures ETF to trade in the country. And according to people familiar with the matter, it may not be much longer until the first ETF is approved for trading. The reason behind this is the fact that the regulator had previously asked interested parties to halt activities regarding applying for ETH ETFs. However, with the re-filings and new filings, it signals that the SEC may finally be ready to review the applications and consider them. ETH price still holding above $1,800 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com What Happens When An ETF Gets Approved? The anticipation around a possible approval for an Ethereum futures ETF is mostly the implications of such an occurrence. Like in 2021 when the first Bitcoin futures ETF was approved in October, the price of BTC surged drastically, reaching a new all-time high price just a month later. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Flips Toward Greed Despite Fall Below $29,000 ETFs are an instrument that helps to bring more volume to an asset and if an ETH ETF gets approved, the price of ETH is expected to rally. This would be the result of a combination of the new volume and interest, as well as the euphoria that comes with it. An ETF approval would likely push the price of ETH above $2,000 and could trigger another bull rally for the coin. Currently, all eyes are on October 16, 2023, when one new filing and four re-filings for Ethereum futures ETFs become active.

Ripple's XRP led the downside action among large-cap digital assets by dropping nearly 5% in the last 24 hours. The fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at 64 cents, the lowest price since July 13's partial court win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  ADA, SOL and MATIC, the tokens of smart contracts platforms, Cardano, Solana and Polygon, also reversed giving up early gains. LTC, the native token of the Litecoin network, extended its losing streak typical around its quadrennial halving event and dropped another 4.5%.  Some smaller cryptocurrencies defied the otherwise red day in crypto markets. Popular dog-themed token SHIB was up 4% as developers unveiled plans to tie all ecosystem applications to a blockchain-based digital identity. Helium's HNT surged near 19% during the day, continuing its momentum since the token's halving day on August 1.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad measure of crypto market performance was recently down 1.5%.  See more: Get professional-grade crypto data and news at CoinDeskMarkets.com  Equity markets drop  U.S. stocks gave up sizable early gains to turn modestly negative by the Friday market close.  The government Friday morning reported the economy as having added 187,000 jobs in July versus forecasts for 200,000. In addition, June's originally reported 209,000 job gain was revised lower to 185,000. There were some stronger data in the report, with the unemployment rate slipping to 3.5% versus forecasts for 3.6%, and average hourly earnings rising at a 4.4% pace against expectations for 4.2%.  The odds of the Federal Reserve hiking rates again at its mid-September meeting slipped to 14% from 20% prior to the report, and the 10-year Treasury yield is pulling back sharply from 2023 highs hit yesterday, now down 11 basis points to 4.06%.  Brace for sideways action  ""I suspect that we will trend sideways for a good long while, perhaps for the next several months or even well into next year,"" Bob Baxley, a core contributor to DeFi infrastructure provider Maverick Protocol, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. ""There isn’t enough fresh capital flowing into the space at the moment for a meaningful rally.""  But Baxley added optimistically that shifting conditions will lead to ""an inflow of both users and new capital.""  ""I say this because Ethereum is seeing its foundations become sturdier and its applications more sophisticated and increasingly friendly for users,"" he wrote.  Meanwhile, U.S. equity markets ticked down slightly as bond yields rose, a sign of lessening investor appetite for risk assets. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively.  In an email to CoinDesk, Brent Xu, CEO and co-founder of Web3 bond-market platform Umee, wrote that crypto prices are unlikely to spike for a prolonged period ""until the macro environment softens more,"" including a cessation of the interest rate hiking that has characterized central banking policy for more than 16 months.  ""We are certainly close to peak rates, though we could have another hike or two ahead of us depending on how sticky inflation actually is,"" Xu wrote. ""I’m not convinced inflation is falling as fast as many are hoping. In short, we have a long way to go before we enter the optimistic phase of the cycle.”  Xu added: ""We experienced such a meteoric surge..., especially with Bitcoin, that I don’t know how these levels can be sustained, let alone surpassed in a meaningful way. We’re left with money already in the digital asset ecosystem just getting recycled through various coins over and again, as has happened in previous down markets.""",NEUTRAL,BTC | SHIB | XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | SHIB | XRP,"James Rubin, Sam Reynolds, Stephen Alpher, Krisztian Sandor",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/03/crypto-markets-today-btc-eth-ada-sol-matic-price-analysis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/388031e070889f0080807464372aae916c3683d1-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15609277,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545698,1691100045,Solana Price Could Surge To $30 Upon Overcoming This Resistance,"The Solana price experienced notable gains in mid-June, but a recent correction phase has pulled it down to $22, which has found strong support. The technical outlook currently leans towards the bears, suggesting a potential slight dip before a possible turnaround. Related Reading: All Hype? BALD Meme Coin’s Volume Shaved By 96% The altcoin attempted to rise from the support level in the past week, but the bullish momentum waned. Despite the chance of a rally due to a demand zone below $22, a new resistance at the $25 level may pose a challenge. As Bitcoin slipped into the $29,000 range, other altcoins also faced downward pressure on their charts. For SOL to reverse its trend, overall market strength is vital. The falling market capitalization of SOL indicates continued control by sellers over the price. Solana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $22.80, demonstrating stability around a significant support zone. Although a drop from this level might attract buyers, there is a possibility that the altcoin could slip below the $20 mark. If buyers step in, the next resistance levels would be $23 and $25. Once the $25 price mark is breached, Solana could aim for $30, signifying a potential 36% rally. However, SOL must avoid falling below $20, as that would nullify any bullish revival. In the last session, the volume of SOL traded declined, suggesting a decrease in buying strength. Technical Analysis SOL showed increased selling pressure, indicating buyers had not yet entered the positive zone. The Relative Strength Index remained below the half-line, stressing the lack of bullish momentum as sellers outnumbered buyers at the time of observation. Moreover, SOL was positioned below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, signifying a lack of demand at this level and further suggesting that sellers had control over the price momentum in the market. The upcoming trading sessions hold significance for the coin as buyers will determine the altcoin’s future direction. The altcoin’s low demand has led to the formation of sell signals. This indicated the continued dominance of bears in the market. However, it’s worth noting that the size of these sell signals is gradually decreasing. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which measures price momentum and trend changes, showed red histograms. This reading was linked to sell signals. Despite this, the sell signals were relatively short, suggesting that the altcoin might see some buying strength in the upcoming trading sessions. On the other hand, the Directional Movement Index (DMI), which indicates price direction, remained negative. The -DI line (orange) was positioned above the +DI line (blue).

Jun Du bought 10 million tokens valued at $4 million from Micheal Egorov, founder of Curve. Egorov had offered his tokens for sale to bolster his at-risk loan positions, primarily for borrowing stablecoins using CRV tokens as collateral. Some Positives For Curve Finance Despite Hack Curve Finance, one of the biggest DeFi protocols on the Ethereum blockchain, recently saw its in-house CRV price recover about 25% at the start of the month. It had previously dropped by 35% between July 30-31 following the panic selloff spearheaded by Curve Finance’s $47 million exploit. Related Reading: Buying Pressure Incoming? MicroStrategy Files Notice With SEC To Sell $750 Million In Stocks The July reentrancy attack was not the only exploit recorded on Curve Finance as the DeFi protocol had previously lost over $570,000 in August 2022 after hackers compromised the front end of its liquidity pool. However, the recent acquisition of 10 million tokens by Jun Du projects a positive outlook for CRV tokens, especially the recent attack on its ecosystem. Confirming the transaction, Du noted that he has locked up his investment for a period of one year as veCRV. Apart from Du, the Aave Chan Initiative, a delegate platform from Aave’s governance forum, recently put forward a proposal for the purchase of about $2 million worth of CRV. After the planned purchase, which is to be made by the Aave Treasury, the CRV tokens would also be locked up as veCRV for about four years. Token price recovers from weekly lows | Source: CRVUSD on Tradingview.com CRV Remains Popular Among Investors Egorov has so far sold 72 million CRV tokens to various investors and the continued purchase and acceptance of the CRV token demonstrates its popularity and utility. One such investor who remains bullish on CRV is Justin Sun, founder of the Tron network. He recently acquired 5 million CRV from Egorov by paying using Tether’s USDT in a direct Over-the-counter (OTC) trade. Justin confirmed the purchase in a tweet noting that both platforms “As steadfast partners” will keep being “…committed to providing support whenever needed.” According to a Twitter post by Sandra from Nansen, other popular purchasers of Curve tokens include Cream Finance, Machi Big Brother, DWF Labs, DCFGod, and Andrew Kang, co-founder of Mechanism Capital. Related Reading: Ethereum ETFs Heat Up As Filings With SEC Climbs To Six A vast majority of these transactions were conducted through OTC, with Egorov realizing over $20 million, which he applied to balancing his borrowings and removing himself from liquidation. Egorov also sent another huge supply of CRV (17.5 million) to an address starting with 0xf51. Once the largest DeFi protocol on the Ethereum blockchain, the vast majority of Curve trading volumes still come from Ethereum.

42410051,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcS1Wp,1691095843,Figure Abandons Quest to be U.S. Chartered Crypto Bank After Three-Year Fight,"Figure Technologies, Inc., has pulled its application to become a federally chartered bank in the U.S.  The decision ends a three-year rollercoaster ride as regulators clamped down on crypto activity and digital assets banking suffered a black eye when regional lenders associated with the tech world cratered earlier this year.  The Figure application in 2020 drew tremendous scrutiny from Wall Street lobbyists and state banking regulators even before it was seriously considered at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), where banks seek nationwide charters. Traditional bankers had been concerned that Figure might be the first of a new category of competitors who didn’t have to check as many of the burdensome compliance boxes as existing lenders.  The bank pursued the charter as a means to streamline about 200 state licenses it was maintaining for financial activity across the U.S., it said when it announced the effort.  Last year, the acting chief of the OCC, Michael Hsu, praised Figure’s willingness to rework its banking plan by agreeing to seek federal deposit insurance, and Hsu welcomed the chance to consider Figure without a legal fight from state regulators raising objections. But the charter was formally withdrawn on July 31, according to OCC records.  ""Figure has made the decision to withdraw our banking charter application as we focus the organization on other areas of growth with a broad set of established bank partners,"" the company said in a statement sent Thursday.  Others were happy at the news that the company had given up on the charter.  “Had Figure not withdrawn its application, both law and common sense would have dictated that regulators reject it,” said Jesse Van Tol, president and CEO of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, in a statement that accused the company of making insufficient plans to meet a bank’s customary obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act. “This is good news for anyone who thinks we should have a stable, safe and appropriately supervised financial system.”  Anchorage Digital won its charter from the OCC in 2021, and two other companies that had sought to immediately follow suit – Paxos and Protego – didn’t manage to sway the crypto-skeptical regulator before their conditional approvals expired earlier this year.  Following a brief period during the previous administration in which the OCC welcomed crypto businesses and sought to make a place for them in the banking sector, the agency – along with the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. – has since warned about the serious risk of the crypto industry and cautioned existing banks that they must limit their exposure to the volatile sector.

But transaction revenue came in at $327 million, compared to $375 million in the first quarter, while total trading volume fell to $92 billion, compared to $145 billion in the first quarter. The company said in its shareholder letter that the poor transaction revenue results “reflects multi-year lows in crypto volatility.” Interest income fell to $201 million from $241 million in Q1. Of that interest income in Q2, $151 million came from its holdings of USDC.  Regarding its Q3 outlook, Coinbase said it had generated roughly $110 million in transaction revenue in July, and said it expected Q3 subscription and services revenue, which came in at $335 million in the second quarter, to be at least $300 million in the third quarter.  Shares of Coinbase initially rose as much as 9% after the results were announced, but were recently trading down 1.4% to $89.48. Shares of Coinbase are up about 160% this year, while the price of bitcoin has risen more than 75% over the same time period.  “Q2 was a strong quarter for Coinbase as we executed well and showed resilience in a challenging environment,” said CEO Brian Armstrong in a statement to CoinDesk. “We’ve cut costs, are operating efficiently, and remain well-positioned to build the future of the crypto economy and help drive regulatory clarity.”  Regarding the results, Berenberg analyst Mark Palmer wrote in an email that ""Coinbase’s revenue beat versus consensus estimates was due in large part to interest income and staking revenue, which are two areas of the company’s business that appear to be at risk going forward given the ongoing declines in USDC’s market capitalization and the regulatory challenges to its staking programs. Interest income from USDC was down 25% sequentially.  ""At the same time,"" Palmer added, ""management’s guidance for Coinbase’s current quarter was muted, and the company’s adjusted EBITDA print included a huge adjustment for stock-based compensation – an area that management had said it would look to reduce due to negative investor feedback.

15605989,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545685,1691092827,Shiba Inu’s DeFi Aspirations May Rattle DOGE’s Market As SHIB Turns To Digital IDs,"Initially tagged as a meme coin, Shiba Inu has been reinventing itself, aiming to break away from its meme coin status and step into the league of serious Decentralized Finance (DeFi) contenders, according to a new report. A key step towards this transformation involves an innovation that is about to reshape the Shiba Inu ecosystem: Digital Identity Verification. Embracing Digital Identity In The Shiba Inu Ecosystem In a push to improve the platform’s credibility among users and governmental entities, the Shiba Inu project is said to integrate Digital Identity Verification into all its future developments. This includes the forthcoming Shibarium Layer 2 blockchain, an update eagerly anticipated by the community. Related Reading: Whale Activity Spikes As Shiba Inu Preps For Shibarium Launch Digital identities or Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI) are, in essence, the digital counterparts of traditional identification documents such as passports and driver’s licenses. In the digital realm, SSIs confer users greater control over their personal data and its distribution online. Currently, Shiba Inu developers are reportedly collaborating with community projects that use SHIB or plan to build on the Shibarium blockchain to prioritize SSI deployment. Shiba Inu’s lead developer, “Shytoshi Kusama,” was the one who revealed the project’s ambitious goals. He stated that they are currently “laying the groundwork for a new global standard in decentralized digital trust and international identity verification. In this way, Shibarium is the herald of a new digital age where faith in systems is restored and enhanced.” Implications For Dogecoin (DOGE) A shift in the crypto market dynamics may be on the horizon as Shiba Inu’s foray into DeFi may have ripple effects, most specifically on Dogecoin (DOGE). Both SHIB and DOGE started as meme coins, but Shiba Inu’s recent maneuvers may force a reconsideration of its stature. With the rise of digital identities and data protection as hot-button topics in areas like Canada and the European Union, Shiba Inu’s move to integrate digital identities into its ecosystem could elevate its reputation. This could lead to an increase in demand for SHIB tokens, which may exert upward pressure on the coin’s price. In contrast, Dogecoin, which remains firmly in its meme coin status, may find itself in an increasingly precarious position. Although, DOGE still has its biggest fan and supporter, Elon Musk behind it, should Shiba Inu succeed in its DeFi transformation, it may establish a new benchmark for meme coins and, in turn, create additional pressure on DOGE to redefine its strategic direction. Furthermore, currently, DOGE is recording more losses than Shiba Inu in the past 24 hours. Particularly, Dogecoin has dropped by nearly 4% in this period while SHIB has only seen a modest downtrend of just 0.4% Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.85? Bullish Setup Hints At Potential For Advance Meanwhile, as DOGE records losses of 7.4% in the past week, SHIB has gone in the opposite direction with an upward trend of 4.5%.

Data compiled by twitter user EmberCN shows that Wintermute Trading recently purchased 25 million CRV tokens for $10 million across two transactions.  Wintermute purchased the tokens for approximately 40 cents each in the OTC deal, while they trade for 58 cents on the open market, according to CoinDesk market data.  Other recent large buyers of CRV tokens in OTC deals include Gnosis Chain and Reserve Protocol.  That cash has helped him pay down some – but not all – of his borrows from Aave, Abracadabra, FraxLend and Inverse Finance, data from blockchain analytics firm DeBank shows.  Egorov, and others, fear contagion if the price of CRV hits $0.368. DeFi risk management firm Gauntlet said in the forums that Aave would have to sell his CRV collateral into a market that has low liquidity, a move that it calls risky.  “While some have claimed that the Curve OTC deals decentralize the token, most of the traders are whales or institutional firms,” Nick Ruck, COO of Defi Protocol ContentFi Labs told CoinDesk. “It’s not necessarily a bad thing for DeFi but it enables risky behavior or protocol founders to expect the industry to save themselves from contagion stemming from an irresponsible loan.”  The price of CRV has remained steady around 58 cents in the past 24 hours, after dropping more than 20% since its exploit several days ago, per CoinDesk Indices.

42392786,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgBLPb,1691091395,"Bitcoin Remains Unmoved by Rise in Jobless Claims, Treasury Rates","A mildly encouraging tick higher in initial jobless claims and alarming rise in Treasury yields failed to move bitcoin’s price much, continuing a months-long trend of BTC immunity to macroeconomic events.  Bitcoin remained relatively unmoved following the jobs report, trading 0.47% higher on Binance. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX), which leverages real time prices across multiple exchanges rose 0.72% by comparison.  To be sure, a number of major altcoins were recently down more than 5% over the past 24 hours amid the soaring yield increases. But bitcoin seemed likely to remain in the narrow range between the $29,000 and $29,500 spread that it’s largely held for the better part of two weeks. Bitcoin was currently trading just above $29,200.  Bitcoin remains in search of a price catalyst that seems increasingly unlikely to come from outside the industry. Spot bitcoin ETF approvals and the 2024 BTC halving can’t come soon enough for bulls.  Initial jobless claims tick higher  The number of Americans filing for unemployment rose to 227,000 last week, 6,000 higher than the prior week, and above expectations of 225,000.The increase signaled at least a slight loosening of labor markets.  Weaker labor markets are historically a prerequisite for lower interest rates, so the reading seems positive on the surface. However, that jobless claims are still near 2023 lows, and 40,000 lower than in June. Thursday’s reading followed an unexpectedly strong ADP jobs report that indicated the hot job market is far from ready to cool. Friday’s full Non-Farm Payrolls report may offer more clarity on the employment market’s direction.  U.S. Treasury Yields Hit 2023 Highs  The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose to its highest level since November 2022, as bond traders reacted to a Fitch downgrade of U.S. debt, and Thursday’s jobless claims. Market observers are differing on the significance of increased 10-year yields.  One interpretation is that capital is flowing from Treasurys because investors see opportunity for better risk adjusted returns in other markets. As bond prices and yields move in opposite directions, a bond sell-off in search of greener pastures results in higher yields.  This would likely result in improved overall sentiment about the U.S. economy. Risk assets such as equities, commodities and cryptocurrencies would benefit.  The other interpretation however is simply that interest rates will be higher for longer than expected and that attitudes about the economy are unlikely to improve. Investors may expect inflationary metrics to persist pushing yields higher across all bond maturities, weighing on cryptocurrency prices.  The proof is sometimes in the pricing  Cryptocurrency prices continue to stagnate. The capital flowing from bonds into risk assets doesn’t appear to be moving into digital assets. Bitcoin has traded tightly between $29,000 and $30,000 since June 22.  Ether has behaved similarly, ranging between $1,890 and $2,000 over the same period. The assets combined make up 66% of total cryptocurrency market capitalizations.  Bitcoin balances fall  In another sign of reluctant crypto markets, the total balance of bitcoin in “accumulation addresses” has declined, according to analytics firm Glassnode. ""Accumulation addresses"" have never spent funds and received at least two incoming transfers. A decline in this indicator implies distribution of bitcoin from addresses historically more apt to hold long term.  We may earn a commission from partner links.

42392771,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgBKKv,1691089808,"Matter Labs Accuses Polygon of Spreading ""Untrue Claims"" With Code-Copying Allegations","Ethereum scaling firm Polygon said in a tweet on Thursday that Matter Labs, the firm behind the zkSync rollup, copied part of Polygon’s open-source code without providing attribution. Matter Labs denied the allegations in a statement to CoinDesk, arguing that the code was ""prominently attributed"" in a line atop one of the files in question.  Blockchain projects frequently release their code under open-source software licenses, meaning outside developers are allowed to read, copy, and even (in some cases) contribute to the code should they so desire. However, community norms – and most open-source licenses – generally require that third-party developers acknowledge when they’ve used code that originated elsewhere.  In a blog post, Polygon alleged that Matter Labs recently released a proving system, called Boojum, which included some source code that had been copy-pasted from Polygon’s own “Plonky2” software library. “This code is included without the original copyrights or clear attribution to the original authors,” Polygon said. “Copy-pasting source code without attribution and making misleading claims about the original work is against the open source ethos and hurts the ecosystem.”  A Matter Labs spokesperson said the blog post from Polygon contained ""untrue claims."" ""The new Boojum high-performance proof system leverages 5% from Plonky2, which is prominently attributed in the first line of our module,"" the spokesperson told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. ""Where else, other than the very first line of our library would this have been included if we wanted it to be more prominent?""  In its blog post, Polygon included several screenshots comparing its own code to that of Matter Labs. In a screenshot of a Matter Labs file titled ""mod.rs"" Polygon captioned that it contained ""no attribution for the original authors."" Matter Labs CEO Alex Gluchowski linked to that same file in a tweet. The first line of the mod.rs file, which was excluded from Polygon's screenshot, reads, ""NOTE: we take a Plonky2 implementation of non-vectorized field as the baseline.""  Polygon's blog post included other examples where its code was apparently lifted without attribution by Matter Labs. Gluchowski later addressed some of those examples in an in-depth tweet, acknowledging that they ""could have done it better. The community rightfully pointed out that there is a more standard approach to attributions, which we will wholeheartedly apply from now on.""  Polygon and Matter Labs build competing zero-knowledge rollups – so-called layer 2 blockchains that offload traffic from the “layer 1” Ethereum chain to offer cheaper and quicker transactions for users. This isn’t the first time tensions have flared up between the two projects as they’ve jostled with one another to attract some of the same users and investors.  This most recent spat between Polygon and Matter Labs highlighted the ongoing tension between two of the leading firms vying to expand Ethereum and lay claim to its next wave of users. It also showed the dark side of open-source culture: making one's code freely available can spur collaboration, earn goodwill and help tech mature – but it can also lead to messiness when there are competing interests at play.  Read more: War of Words Over zkEVMs Might Portend Long Struggle to Tech Maturity  Other members of Ethereum’s layer 2 ecosystem took the occasion of Polygon’s blog post to share their own disappointment with Matter Labs. Starkware co-founder Uri Kolodny tweeted that it wasn’t “the first time” that a company had copied another team’s code without giving credit, adding, “I'll bet an ice-cream it won't be the last time either.” Kolodny didn’t clarify in his tweet whether he was talking about Matter Labs or speaking generally.

42392788,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgBLZr,1691089674,"Traders Ditch USDT on Curve, Uniswap, Pushing Key Exchange Pools Into Imbalance","Traders sold Tether’s USDT in droves Thursday on key stablecoin exchange pools on Curve and UniSwap.  USDT dropped to as low as 99.76 cents and traded slightly below its $1 peg for most of the day.  Crypto traders appeared to ditch Tether’s USDT in droves Thursday in key stablecoin pools on Curve Finance and Uniswap decentralized exchanges, pushing the pools into heavy imbalances.  Data shows that the USDT balance surged to 62% in the Curve 3pool, which consists of USDT, USDC and DAI stablecoins, while USDC and DAI comprised roughly 19-19% of all assets in the pool.  In the USDT-USDC trading pool on Uniswap, one of the most liquid pairs on the platform, the USDT balance stood at $105.4 million compared to just $6.5 million of USDC.  The current imbalances suggest that investors increasingly prefer to hold DAI or USDC instead of USDT, as there are more USDT sellers in the pool.  USDT’s price has been trading slightly below its $1 peg during the day, according to CoinDesk and CoinMarketCap data, a consequence of the selling pressure. The token dropped as low as 99.76 cents, per CoinDesk Indices.  The Curve and Uniswap pools are popular venues for traders to swap one stablecoin for another quickly. Most of the time, the tokens are in balance in the pools. Imbalances indicate distress in the markets as investors seek ways to ditch an asset en masse.  Similar imbalances happened during Terra’s implosion in May 2022 and this March when the Silicon Valley Bank crisis hit the USDC issuer Circle.  Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer of Tether, hinted at potential foul play in an X (formerly Twitter) post late Thursday, which some observers interpreted as a thinly veiled jab against crypto exchange giant Binance and its chief executive Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao.  ""Isn't it interesting that USDt is being pressured down (slightly, within 10bps, just to push market makers to react), and USDc, the main competitor that you would expect being gaining from the situation, is redeemed heavily nevertheless, while suddenly a competitor born 2 days ago is getting it all?,"" he posted. ""It feels definitely organic and not manipulative at all.""  The competitor cited in the post could be Hong Kong-based First Digital's new stablecoin FDUSD, which Binance quickly embraced recently.  The exchange listed the token on July 26 by allowing to trade BNB, Binance USD and Tether's USDT with it. The platform is also set to open bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) trading with FDUSD and to boost trading with the stablecoin by waiving trading fees starting Friday.

Crypto Scammers Are “So Good Now,” Binance CEO Says In a tweet on August 2, Changpeng Zhao described a recent scam attempt as “clever,” stating that it was “luckily” prevented as the bad actors in the crypto space seem to have gotten better. Related Reading: Curve DAO (CRV) Price Recovery Post-Exploit: What Would Be A Realistic Scenario? Specifically, the Binance CEO drew attention to how these scammers now generate addresses with identical starting and ending letters as other wallet addresses. Using these new addresses, they then proceed to impersonate other network participants and swindle unsuspecting crypto users. Technically, these kinds of scams are referred to as “zero-transfer phishing attacks.” I want to share this (luckily) unsuccessful, but very clever and close scam incident from yesterday 👇. Saved $20m. Hope it may also save you one day. The scammers are so good now they generate addresses with the same starting and ending letters, which is what most people check… https://t.co/DFpdX8aNay — CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) August 2, 2023 Changpeng Zhao noted that these scams are particularly effective as most crypto users only confirm the first and last characters of an address when conducting transactions. In fact, he stated that most wallet designs exclude the middle parts of addresses in an attempt to offer a better user interface to users Asides from creating similar wallet addresses, the Binance CEO mentioned that these scammers would send “dust transactions” so they could be registered in their targets’ transaction history. To explain, dust refers to a minute amount of cryptocurrency, usually valued at less than a cent, and cannot be traded on any exchange. With the scammer’s address now present in their target’s transaction history, one can unknowingly transfer assets to these bad actors, especially if the impersonated address is one they constantly transact with. Total crypto market cap valued at $1.13 trillion on the 4-hour chart | Source: TOTAL chart on Tradingview.com Fast Response Helped Thwart Zero-Transfer Phishing Attack Changpeng Zhao stated that a zero phishing attack happened to a veteran crypto operator on Aug 1 in which they transferred $20 million worth of USDT to the wrong address. For context, the original wallet address was 0xa7Bf48749D2E4aA29e3209879956b9bAa9E90570, while the phishing address was 0xa7B4BAC8f0f9692e56750aEFB5f6cB5516E90570. Luckily, the operator detected the scam quickly, and Binance was able to officially request for Tether to freeze the stolen USDT. The stablecoin operator responded promptly by blacklisting the wallet to prevent any further deposit or withdrawal. Related Reading: Ethereum DeFi Coins Plunge As Curve Concerns Threaten Major Market Crash The Binance CEO rounded off his tweet by stating that a fast reaction was vital to reclaiming users’ funds in these kinds of attacks. However, he did state that the assets recovery may take some time as the sender would have to complete a number of processes, including submitting a police report. It is no news that the crypto space is riddled with heists, scams, and attacks which result in the loss of millions of dollars yearly. And these crypto scams are considered one of the major plagues in the crypto space. According to data from Certik Security, crypto scams and hacks claimed over $313 million in just Q2 2023 alone. Another report from TRM Labs in June 2023 said that over $9 billion was lost to various scams and frauds in 2022. A huge portion (around $7.8 billion) of this figure was lost to Ponzi schemes alone, TRM added.

Seven-year-long Investigation Comes to an End According to the CNBC report, resident of New York City Ilya Lichtenstein admitted to being the original hacker behind the 2016 Bitfinex attack in a federal court in Washington, D.C on July 3. On the same day, his wife Heather Morgan also pleaded guilty to the counts of money laundering and conspiracy related to the hack. The cyberattack deprived Bitfinext of almost 120 BTC, which was worth $70 million at the time and has since risen to the price of $4.5 billion. It took the US Department of Justice (DOJ) seven years to seize the stolen funds and the person responsible for the hack. “Bitfinex diligently worked with the U.S. Department of Justice to identify the perpetrators of the hack, recover the stolen bitcoin, and bring the hackers to justice,"" said an external spokesperson for Bitfinex. ""After seven years, those efforts have come to fruition.” The Bizarre Couple Caught for Money Laundering Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife Heather Morgan, also known as “Razzlekhan” (the name she uses to publish her comedy rap videos) were arrested on charges of money laundering and theft in connection to the 2016 Bitfinex hack in February 2022. However, the Department of Justice didn’t accuse the couple of being the original hackers behind the attack at that time. Morgan proclaimed to be a cybercrime expert specializing in social engineering on her LinkedIn, while Lichtenstein had technical background in coding and data analysis. These facts suggested that the couple had enough expertise to pull off the hack, even though many didn’t believe it due to the image of eccentric personas the two projected on the Internet. Most of the Bitfinex Funds Recovered At the time of Lichtenstein's and Morgan’s arrest, the DOJ was able to recover 94,000 BTC linked to the hack, the sum now equivalent to around $3.6 billion. It was discovered that in early 2017, Lichtenstein “began to move a portion of the Bitcoin” stolen during the Bitfinex attack “in a series of small, complex transactions across multiple accounts and platforms.” The shuffling process, which involved a large number of transactions, was aimed at obscuring the path of the stolen money. Last month, the crypto exchange recovered another part of its lost funds: $312,219 in cash and 6.9 in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) worth around $1951 today. Apparently, the United States Department of Homeland Security got control of the sum in 2022 after the culprit’s arrest. The couple is now facing up to 25 years in prison.

15602711,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545635,1691085632,Quant Explains How These Indicators Affect Ethereum Price,"A quant has explained how the indicators like taker buy/sell ratio and Coinbase premium index can influence the price of Ethereum. Ethereum’s Relationship With Taker Buy/Sell Ratio & Coinbase Premium Index In a new CryptoQuant quicktake post, an analyst has discussed some metrics that could hold relevance for the ETH price. The first indicator of interest here is the “taker buy/sell ratio,” which tells us about the ratio between the Ethereum buy and sell orders in the market right now. When this metric has a value greater than 1, it means that the taker buy volume is higher than the taker sell volume. Such a trend implies that the majority of the investors are bullish on the asset currently. On the other hand, values below the threshold naturally imply the dominance of bearish sentiment, as there are currently more sell orders present on exchanges. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 50-day moving average (MA) Ethereum taker buy/sell ratio over the past few years: The potential relationship between these indicators and the value of the cryptocurrency | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the quant has highlighted the pattern that the Ethereum price and the 50-day MA taker buy/sell ratio have possibly followed during the past couple of years. It would appear that whenever the value of the asset has rallied, the taker buy/sell ratio has gone down. This would suggest that the sell orders on the market pile up as the ETH price trends up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates Most Positive Since Feb, Long Squeeze Soon? The analyst notes that this is naturally because the investors become more cautious as the price continues to rise since they think a correction may be coming soon. The sell orders continue until the cryptocurrency has topped out, and once the decline hits the asset, the buy orders start going up instead. From the chart, it’s visible that significant accumulation periods have generally paved the way for the price to bottom out and begin another rally. The quant has also attached data for another metric: the Coinbase Premium Index. This indicator keeps track of the difference in the Ethereum prices listed on Coinbase and Binance. Whenever this metric has a positive value, it means that the Coinbase platform has BTC listed at a higher price than Binance currently. This implies that buying pressure has been stronger from US-based investors, who usually use the former exchange. Similarly, negative values imply just the opposite. According to the analyst, major fluctuations in the Ethereum price have generally come with strong changes in the Coinbase premium index, a possible sign that activity on the exchange is the driver for these price moves. Currently, the 50-day MA taker buy/sell ratio is at relatively low values and is looking to turn around, although this trend shift towards buy order dominance isn’t confirmed just yet. Related Reading: Litecoin Completes Halving, But Price Plunges 6% The Coinbase Premium Index is at neutral values, implying that there hasn’t been any trading activity happening on the platform that’s different from Binance. Given these trends, it’s possible that Ethereum may not see any big moves in the near future. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,830, up 2% in the last week.

This development is a critical part of the company's mission to maximize recoveries for creditors and expedite the return of cryptocurrencies to clients, said Mark Renzi, BlockFi’s chief restructuring officer. The firm's restructuring plan will allow BlockFi to direct efforts towards recouping funds from other failed businesses such as Alameda Research, FTX, Three Arrows Capital, Emergent, Marex, and Core Scientific. However, the proposed plan has not been devoid of criticism,. Organizations like FTX, Three Arrows Capital, and the Securities and Exchange Commission have voiced concerns about the plan's fairness and its potential to absolve BlockFi and its management from legal responsibility, especially with disputed transactions worth over a billion dollars hanging in the balance. Under the new plan, BlockFi intends to refund non-wallet funds back to customers, while also creating a ""convenience claim class"" for customers with claims under $3,000, who would receive a lump sum payout equating to 50% of the total claim. The company will also refrain from clawing back amounts under $250,000 that clients properly transferred from BlockFi interest accounts or BlockFi private client accounts to wallets.

Elon Musk’s X Set To Disrupt Traditional Trading Platforms? In a request for plans viewed by Semafor and individuals familiar with the matter, the company outlined its vision for integrating financial content, real-time stock data, and other features into its platform. The request emphasizes the power of real-time information in investing. It highlights the enormous user base of “hundreds of millions of highly-qualified users” that the company can offer to potential partners. Related Reading: Why The Uniswap (UNI) Token Is Almost Worthless: Researcher One striking aspect of the request is the absence of any mention of compensation. Instead, interested bidders are asked to state how much money they will commit to the project. This unconventional approach reflects the company’s determination to forge a new path and disrupt the industry without relying on traditional financial partnerships or revenue models. The comparison to WeChat in China, Gojek in Indonesia, Grab in Singapore, and Gozem in Africa further illustrates the company’s ambition. These “super-apps” have transformed how people in their respective regions interact with technology, offering a wide range of services within a single platform. By positioning itself as the first Western super-app, the company aims to disrupt the traditional trading platforms. Dogecoin Integration On X’s Trading App? Twitter’s latest move to introduce a feature allowing users to access live stock charts by simply searching for a “cashtag” has sparked intrigue and speculation in the online community. With cashtag clicks experiencing a remarkable 51% growth over the past two months, it’s clear that Twitter is onto something potentially lucrative. This feature could attract users and generate revenue for the company through partnerships with data startups like TradingView. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Notches New Adoption Record In Anticipation Of Shibarium Launch On the other hand, Musk’s support for Dogecoin has been well-documented, and now, with the introduction of his new trading app, speculation is growing about the potential impact on the meme coin’s price. When writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.07461, maintaining its price level for the past 24 hours. Nevertheless, the introduction of Musk’s trading app has the potential to ignite a new wave of enthusiasm for Dogecoin, increasing its value. However, it’s worth noting that Twitter’s plans to incorporate a one-click option to buy and sell stocks on eToro, a competitor to Robinhood, have been delayed. Initially slated for an April launch, this feature has yet to materialize. The potential to refer users to a brokerage platform like eToro could be a significant revenue stream for Twitter, as it seeks to regain the advertisers it lost after Elon Musk’s takeover. While Twitter’s foray into financial services and e-commerce may seem bold and innovative, it is not without its challenges. Other social media giants in the United States, such as Snapchat and Meta (formerly Facebook), have attempted similar ventures with little success.

Elon Musk’s soon-to-be super app X, formerly known as Twitter, is looking for a financial-data giant to build a trading hub inside the app, news outlet Semafor reported, citing documents and people familiar with the matter.  According to the documents, X sent a request to financial-data providers in recent weeks asking for proposals on financial content and real-time stock data, among others, Semafor said, adding that It wasn’t clear if any firms had submitted proposals due last week.  The request to the data firms also said that X is offering potential partners a reach of “hundreds of millions of highly qualified users,” but won't compensate them. The firms were asked to put down the amount of money they would be willing to invest in the project, Semafor reported.  Musk, however, said on X that “no work is being done on this to the best of my knowledge.” While this is not a direct denial, it could suggest such a service may be in the works but may not be imminent.  This isn't the first time a potential for a trading hub within the X platform was floated. Earlier this year, social investing platform eToro said it is set to offer trading services of crypto and other assets directly to the users of then-called Twitter through an arrangement with the company.  If plans to build an in-app trading hub do go through, given Musk’s affinity for digital assets - specifically meme coin dogecoin (DOGE) — the platform could easily allow the trading of cryptocurrencies on top of other assets, in particular bitcoin (BTC), which potentially be a safe asset to list from a regulatory perspective.  Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong earlier this week made public that the Securities and Exchange Commission had told him to stop trading all cryptocurrencies but bitcoin, suggesting that regulators wouldn’t have an issue with that particular cryptocurrency.  Musk had previously announced his plans to allow payments on the X platform, initially only in fiat currencies. Still, he was open to the idea of having the option to add crypto at a later point.  Musk refashioned Twitter to X in July as part of his plans to create an everything-app — much like China’s WeChat — that would allow for a wider variety of services, including payments and gaming. Crypto experts reacted positively to the change, saying that the rebranding could be a “game-changer” for the ecosystem.  Read more: Twitter Is Dead.

42392776,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgBKkZ,1691084221,Crypto and the Real Meaning of 'Radicalism',"I first got interested in Bitcoin, going on a decade ago now, thanks to some of its more extreme political affiliations. In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, investor interest in gold skyrocketed, particularly among survivalists and “preppers.” These “gold bugs” were often extremely libertarian (with hints of what we’d now call the far-right), and it was through talking to them that I started thinking really seriously about Bitcoin.  I came with an outsider’s viewpoint on the hard-money longings and radical free-market ethos of these early Bitcoin adopters. Personally, I was, and remain, a dishwater-boring European-style democratic socialist, with a cypherpunk’s commitment to privacy and a few dollops of anarcho-syndicalist sympathies. But that political disconnect has never swayed my interest in crypto. In fact, even if I never much agreed with their conclusions, I came to respect many of the principled libertarians involved in the space. (I have infinitely less patience for the authoritarian far-right, especially in its overtly statist Zoomer form.)  The past four or five years, though, have seen a significant widening of political thought within crypto. Perhaps most significantly, Ethereum’s smart-contract architecture has attracted a huge wave of would-be economic engineers, focused not on Bitcoin-style individual sovereignty, but new incentive structures they hope can foster a more balanced and healthy society. Two key examples include Glen Weyl’s ""Radical Markets"" theories, and the nascent “regenerative economics” discourse spearheaded by Gitcoin founder Kevin Owocki and others.  It was in that context that a new Twitter account declaring itself “The Blockchain Socialist” appeared on my radar two or three years ago. An accompanying podcast welcomed truly transformative figures like artists Rhea Myers, Ethereum cofounder Amir Taaki and Sci-hub’s Alexandra Elbakyan, who saw the utility of crypto to their widely varied activist projects. The Blockchain Socialist became a nexus for discussions of American economic imperialism and the left-wing case for privacy in particular, two pillars that have helped define positions outside of crypto’s largely libertarian mainstream.  What is a radical?  The Blockchain Socialist finally came out from behind the curtain this year, revealing themselves as Joshua Dávila. Dávila has spent several years with Deloitte in Europe as a business consultant on blockchain issues, and also founded Breadchain, a project aimed at building “solidarity primitives” that parallel the “financial primitives” beloved of smart-contract developers.  Now, to help get his points across, Dávila is publishing his first book: ""Blockchain Radicals: How Capitalism Ruined Crypto and How to Fix It,"" out Aug. 8 from Repeater Press. Buterin describes the book as “an important complement to existing narratives” in crypto.  What actually defines a radical is the willingness to rethink assumptions at the very deepest level  The book is essentially a long exploratory essay, working to flesh out Dávila’s fundamental belief in crypto as a tool for organizing non-state social and economic alliances, from mutual aid groups, to bail funds, to new models for funding technology development.  Dávila says that, up to now, he has had a much harder time pitching his peers in politics on the promise of blockchain and crypto.  “If you try and talk about crypto stuff in a left-wing forum, you’ll get banned,” he told me. “I was constantly accused of being a scammer. I assumed we could just have a grounded conversation, but I found out that wasn’t really possible.”  ""Blockchain Radicals"" pushes back against this sort of reductive condemnation of crypto. What’s most ironic is that these dismissals have come most often and loudly from neoliberal centrists who long to fall back into the warm embrace of institutions (such as, very recently, notoriously repressive intelligence agencies).  These centrists have seemingly spread their knee-jerk, ironically uncritical dismissal of cryptocurrency as a fraud from snout to tail as a corollary of their talent for masquerading as justice-oriented progressives—an easy enough task in the American political context. Dávila characterizes these responses to crypto, including catastrophizing about crypto’s energy usage without addressing broader systemic issues, as a liberal “moral panic.”  ""Blockchain Radicals"" can function partly as a deprogramming manual for those waylaid by this skewed and deceptive just-so story. Crucially, the book includes concise, workable, and open-minded introductions to basic crypto concepts like proof of work, smart contracts, non-fungible tokens. (NFTs) and distributed apps, as well as historical briefs on, for instance, the creation of Litecoin and ""the DAO"" hack. These are well-marked, and so easy to skip if you don’t need a refresher, but crucial for anyone who has spent years dismissing blockchains with a sneering hand-wave instead of substantive engagement.  See also: Paul Ennis –Ethereum's Political Philosophy Explained | Opinion (2021)  “My book is not necessarily meant to answer the question of ‘what is blockchain socialism,’” Dávila told me. “I don’t think that’s really the question to be asking. What I was trying to do with this book is deconstruct the way people think about blockchains … and show how those mental models are flawed.”  Crypto’s radical potential  In that sense, the title ""Blockchain Radicals"" may be confusing. Despite growing awareness of right-wing “radicalism” over the past decade, the term is still often associated with left-wingers like the Weathermen or Che Guevara.  But a “radical” can actually have any set of political beliefs whatsoever. What actually defines a radical is the willingness to rethink assumptions at the very deepest level, including truths that a society may take for granted or hold sacrosanct. The linguistic origin of the term “radical” is in the Latin radix or radic-, meaning root: a radical is someone who digs beneath the soil to uncover both the origins of things, and their true nature.  [Dávila] unapologetically lauds crypto’s potential for circumventing unjust laws.  The radicalism of crypto will be obvious to the truly crypto-pilled, regardless of political orientation. Over the past decade crypto first invited, and more recently forced, reconsiderations of basic concepts like money, banking, investment, borders and even the nation itself (Dávila repeatedly pushes back against Balaji Srinivasan’s ""Network State"").  One of the broadest “radical” potentials Dávila ascribes to crypto is its ability to redefine, and maybe revivify, “the commons.” Historically, European and other feudal or tribal societies were organized around an agricultural “commons” shared by a community. New land and labor regimes led these to be cut up into hierarchical private holdings (a process later known as ""enclosure"") between roughly the 18th and 20th centuries.  In its later stages, this restructuring was justified with the false and racist narrative of “the tragedy of the commons.” This trope has since become a rationale for all kinds of profit-juicing privatization initiatives, including modern patent and intellectual property regimes that can restrain the advance of technology.  In this light, crypto's fundamental structural reliance on open-source software development may be one of its deepest radical tendencies. Dávila also describes crypto as enabling new kinds of digital commons that leverage new mechanisms for shared property and incentive design. That’s just one aspect of the broader potential he sees for bottom-up economic engineering via blockchains.  Dávila also proudly embraces more in-your-face crypto-radicalism: he unapologetically lauds crypto’s potential for circumventing unjust laws.  He shares my awestruck admiration, for instance, for Kazakh developer Alexandra Elbakyan, an information insurgent on par with Aaron Swarz or even Edward Snowden. Through her 100% against-the-law site Sci Hub, which I am linking here, Elbakyan has for more than a decade been liberating publicly-funded scientific research from the vampiric grasp of fundamentally corrupt, rent-seeking “publishers” like Elsevier. She’s pushing back against one of the most glaring perversions of the common good by capitalist enclosure of public property—and Bitcoin has made that effort sustainable.  Concrete proposals, projects, and tendencies are explored throughout ""Blockchain Radicals."" They can even seem prosaic, at least for anyone who hasn’t directly faced the challenge of building them with pre-crypto tools.  Possibly most interesting is the potential for DAO-like structures and smart contracts for building new kinds of cooperative businesses. As boring as it may seem, a huge barrier to building new economic models is simply bookkeeping, trust and coordination. For instance, I lived in collectively owned housing for many years as a student, which was great for keeping costs down. But it required a lot of commitment and mutual trust, especially when it came to managing collective funds for things like house repairs and taxes.  See also: The Bitcoiners Who Live 'Permanently Not There' (2020)  In today’s America, worker-owned businesses or resident-owned apartments may sound like radical ideas, but they were once common in this country. The first U.S. co-op was apparently founded by Benjamin Franklin in 1752, and they’ve since successfully demonstrated the practical benefits of at least a little bit of socialism. The transparency and immutability of a well-designed DAO and smart contract stack could make such collective ownership much easier and more transparent, potentially putting more money back in workers’ pockets.  Dávila is right to warn that his book doesn’t try to define precisely how blockchain tech can help create a more economically just and stable world. While he details many specific admirable examples, and draws lessons from them, ""Blockchain Radicals"" is not a prescriptive taxonomy or game plan for “socialism on the blockchain.”  Instead, the book is about opening minds to a broader set of possibilities in crypto than you’re ever likely to encounter in mainstream media. If you’re interested in changing the world, that conspicuous silence alone should be plenty of motivation to pick it up.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT,David Z.

It appears that the forthcoming Shibarium launch has propelled SHIB to a significant milestone, as the number of addresses holding the token has hit a new all-time record. Shiba Inu Sets New All-Time High In Addresses Data from IntoTheBlock reveals that the number of SHIB addresses at a given time has reached a new peak of 3.51 million. The previous all-time high was set in May 2022, when the number of addresses stood at 3.23 million. The number of addresses holding the SHIB token has been steadily rising in the past few months, but this rate of adoption notably surged in July. This is reflected in last week’s figure, as the number of addresses holding the token spiked by more than 22%. Related Reading: Over $28 Million In SHIB Withdrawn From Exchanges Ahead Of Shibarium Launch A steady increase in the number of SHIB addresses suggests a growing interest in the meme token. This can be attributed to a combination of various factors, including the upcoming Shibarium launch, the token’s price performance, and the recent resurgence of DOGE – the poster boy for meme coins. The recent market activity of Shiba Inu whales further amplifies the optimism surrounding the SHIB token. On Wednesday, August 2, NewsBTC reported that the cryptocurrency’s large volume transactions reached approximately 1.13 trillion SHIB. SHIB Price Hovers Around Critical Level – Price Overview The price of the Shiba Inu appears to be slowing down after displaying bullish strength before the end of July. The token rallied nearly 12% between July 28 and July 30 to break above the $0.000008 level. However, this recent momentum appears to be waning, as the token’s price has not made any notable action in the past few days. With a 0.9% price dip in the last 24 hours, the SHIB token continues to trade within the $0.00000831 zone. SHIBUSDT trading within the $0.0000083 zone on daily timeframe | Source: SHIBUSDT chart from TradingView Investors should keep an eye on the meme coin in the coming week, as a break out of this zone could see it visit the $0.0000087 mark again. Moreover, with the Shibarium mainnet launch roughly 10 days away, a bullish scenario may be on the cards. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Is Shibarium The Key To A Trend Reversal? According to CoinGecko data, the SHIB token is currently valued at $0.0000082, representing a 4.5% price increase in the past week. With a market cap of roughly $4.86 billion, Shiba Inu ranks as the 15th-largest cryptocurrency in the market.

Centralized exchanges Coinbase and OKX saw their trading volume decline in July, with Coinbase’s volumes dropping by 11.6% to $28.6 billion, while OKX witnessed a 5.8% decline to $29 billion.  Upbit bucked the general market trend, witnessing a 42.3% increase in trading volume to $29.8 billion, pushing the exchange beto the second-largest platform by trading volume, after Binance. Coinbase was previously the second largest crypto exchange by trading volume.  Other South Korean exchanges including Bithumb and CoinOne also saw an increase in trading volume across July, the report said.  ""The Korean market has thought to have been largely driven by retail traders who have built a reputation in the crypto sector. The Kimchi Premium is an example of this, a popular phenomenon which has historically been fueled by strong local demand for digital assets,"" said Jacob Joseph, a research analyst at CCData, in a note to CoinDesk.  The kimchi premium represents the difference between bitcoin's price on South Korean exchanges and the going rate on other global trading platforms. ""This influx of volume, combined with the declining trading activity in other regions, has led to the increased dominance of Korean exchanges,"" added Joseph.  Although Binance remains the largest platform for spot trading in crypto, recording $208 billion in trading volume in July, the exchange’s market share declined for the fifth consecutive month in July. Binance’s market share now stands at 40.4%, its lowest mark since August 2022.  Upbit saw the largest market share increase in July, with the exchange now accounting for 5.8% of the trading volumes on centralized exchanges. Huobi Global and Kucoin also saw increases in market share in July.  The decline in market share for Binance comes as the exchange faces continued scrutiny from regulators, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accusing Binance and its CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao of offering unregistered securities to the general public, among other allegations, in June. The exchange also saw at least three of its top executives depart in early July.

The new game, launching in the next few weeks, will allow players to assemble mechs, or giant robotic characters, using collectible NFT parts that can be moved around to create ""1.5 quadrillion"" different combinations. To start, players will need to mint a mech NFT, comprised of 10 mech parts that can be found inside boxes sold to those on the Wreck League allowlist.  While the Web3 version of the game requires a mech NFT and Ethereum-compatible wallet and will facilitate competitive game events and tournaments, developers promise a free-to-play, non-blockchain version of the game that will be available on a range of platforms, including iOS. In the Web2 version, players can also purchase non-NFT copies of mechs created on the blockchain, with an undisclosed portion of the revenue generated flowing back to the owners of the original mechs.  As part of season one of the game, nWay and Animoca Brands entered into a licensing agreement with Yuga Labs to incorporate four of its collections into the game's storyline: Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Bored Ape Kennel Club and Otherside Kodas.  Taehoon Kim, CEO of nWay, told CoinDesk that while players won't be able to battle one another as Bored Apes, characters from Yuga Lab’s canonical universe, such as Curtis, Jimmy, Gary and Blue will be woven into the game's narrative. Kim considers this approach as part of the ""non-canonical extended Yugaverse.""     ""Wreck League’s universe is a distinct storyline that keeps Yuga Lab’s canonical universe separate,"" he explained.  Wreck League players have the opportunity to compete for on-chain prizes, including mech parts and booster boxes with varying rarities.  Web3 investment giant Animoca Brands is already connected to several popular blockchain games through its subsidiaries, including metaverse platform The Sandbox. Yuga Labs has also expanded into gaming, recently hiring chief gaming officer Spencer Tucker to help develop its Otherside metaverse and launching a number of mini-games to build out its ecosystem.

42392769,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgBKFn,1691078788,Michael Saylor Says Bitcoin ETFs Will Be the ‘Super Tanker’ for His MicroStrategy ‘Sports Car’,"Michael Saylor said MicroStrategy will continue to be the top choice for investors looking to gain exposure to bitcoin even if a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) gets approved.  He said an ETF would bring billions of dollars in investments into the market, which would profit companies like MicroStrategy, which have significant exposure to the cryptocurrency.  MicroStrategy (MSTR) chairman Michael Saylor said his software company would continue to be the go-to company for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin (BTC) without directly buying it, even if a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is rolled out.  If the regulators approve one of the nine currently open applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a spot ETF would pour billions of dollars in investments into the bitcoin market, Saylor said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Wednesday. This would help companies like MicroStrategy, whose balance sheet holds a massive amount of bitcoin, he added.  He likened the software company’s stock to a fast car investors can use to supercharge their bitcoin exposure, while an approved spot ETF will supply the fuel the market needs to keep prices elevated. ""We are that sports car. The spot ETF will be that super tanker,"" he said. ""We view it as really beneficial to the entire ecosystem.""  Stocks such as MicroStrategy and crypto miners are highly correlated to the price of their digital assets in their balance sheets. Investors has historically used these stocks to gain exposure to digital assets without buying them directly from a crypto exchange.  MicroStrategy, a well-known bitcoin whale, owns around $4.5 billion bitcoin after purchasing another $341 million in the second quarter. It also announced that it may sell up to $750 million of stock to buy more bitcoin, among other things.  Since adopting its bitcoin strategy, which is to convert all of its earnings from its core software intelligence business into bitcoin, the company has generated a 254% return, outperforming the cryptocurrency, which has risen 145% since then, according to a research report from TD Cowen.  The shares of MicroStrategy have climbed about 170% this year, while bitcoin rose more than 70%.  Read more: Michael Saylor Lost Big in the Dot-Com Bubble and Bitcoin’s Crash.

15599586,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545671,1691078427,Ukraine Government Reveals Crypto Firms Have Cost The Country $81 Million In Lost Taxes,"According to data released by the Ukrainian government, cryptocurrency firms offering services in Ukraine have failed to contribute over $81 million in taxes to the country’s budget in the past decade. This comes after the country passed a crypto bill into law in 2022 that amends its tax code to allow the country to generate taxes from cryptocurrency transactions. A Huge Loss In Revenue For Ukraine In a notice released on Wednesday, the Economic Security Bureau of Ukraine stated that unrelated cryptocurrency exchanges were responsible for the loss of approximately 3 billion hryvnia in taxes (roughly $81 million) between 2013 to 2023. Related Reading: MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Says Spot ETF Approvals Have No Bearing On Bitcoin Strategy The country’s foremost regulator noted that it had evaluated the trading actions of exchanges founded by residents of the country, which had $55 billion in Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Tether (USDT) volume in rough estimates over the same period. Speaking to local media following the announcement, Deputy Director of the Economic Security Bureau Andriy Pashchuk stated that there were different perspectives on “how these transactions should be taxed and (the bureau) will act in accordance with the provisions adopted by the deputies.” He opined that while these issues drag on, the country keeps losing “..tens of millions in taxes every month.” Crypto Tax Losses Follow Passage Of Landmark Bill The recent loss of revenue follows the recent passage of the legislation “On Virtual Assets” by the Ukrainian parliament in 2022. The law was enacted amid the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies as a valid means for conducting transactions. The bill, which was signed into law in March 2022 by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, sought to create a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency transactions in the country. Total market cap continues to decline | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com At the time of passing the bill, the government stated that it was looking to amend the country’s civil and tax codes to accommodate the new legal framework. However, as of August 2023, no such amendments have been executed. Ukraine also brought some minor amendments to the legislation in September 2022 to ensure that the law was in sync with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Asset (MiCA) regulation. Related Reading: Here’s Where The Price Of LUNC Will Land This August, According To This Algorithm Since then, many crypto users in Ukraine have taken to Telegram to ask whether they would be mandated to provide “backpay” of taxes based on transactions over the last decade. Some noted the government’s failure to properly adopt the regulations despite the passage of the law in 2022. According to one Telegram user with the username Vini2010w, had the government adopted the law, “everything would have been settled a long time ago.” Ukraine has been heavily reliant on cryptocurrency donations amid the ongoing war with Russia. About $225 million in cryptocurrency donations have been pledged in support of the country since 2022 following Russia’s invasion. The vast majority of the donations were made in Ethereum and Bitcoin, the two most popular cryptocurrencies and the largest by market cap.

42392780,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgBKzx,1691078400,More Money For Creators: NFT Minting Platform Zora Initiates New Revenue Split,"Zora, an NFT creation platform, started a revenue split to help creators earn more money.  Popular NFT creators Bobby Kim and Latashá will release new mints on Zora this week.  Zora, the popular non-fungible token (NFT) minting platform, is updating its revenue split model to put more money back into the pockets of creators, as the debate about artist royalties continues.  The creator-focused platform charges collectors a flat minting fee of 0.000777 ETH (about $1.40) per NFT minted. Beginning on Thursday, Zora will automatically split funds earned from its mint fees with creators, providing them with a larger slice of the pie in the hopes of incentivizing more creators to release projects on its site.  Creators will now receive a minimum of 42.9% of the mint fees earned from free mints, while 100% of revenue generated from paid mints will go back to creators. Developers will also be rewarded for building on Zora's protocol, expanding the pool of who gets paid for their role in an NFT drop.  Zora has continued to iterate on its revenue model as attitudes toward creator royalties have shifted. Prior to February, the platform charged creators a 5% fee for each primary sale of an NFT created using its creator toolkit. The platform does not charge a listing fee and no longer charges a creation fee.  ""We didn't want to keep taking money out of creators' pockets,"" Dee Goens, co-founder and COO of Zora, told CoinDesk. ""It's already hard enough for creators to make money in NFTs and in Web3.""  A number of well-known creators will be releasing free mints on Zora this week, including Bobby Kim and Latashá, in honor of the platform's fee updates.  Goens explained that the changes are aimed at expanding its market as platforms like OpenSea continue to dominate. ""We're progressing from being extractive to expansive,"" he explained.  Creator royalties have come into the spotlight in recent months as platforms like Blur began to adopt ""royalty-optional"" models tailored toward fast-paced traders. These changes, sparked by waning mainstream interest in NFTs, created tension between platforms and creators, who argued that they were the ones getting hurt the most. Earlier this month, Nansen reported that NFT royalty payments hit a two-year low, suggesting that collectors have been opting out of paying optional fees.  ""I think platforms and collectors want to see creators make more money,"" he said. ""We all should be incentivized to figure out how to do that.""  Goens said that platforms need to do more to correct these wrongs by making their policies more transparent and on chain – even if that means taking a financial hit.  ""At the end of the day, it's a trade-off, but it's one that Zora is willing to make,"" he concluded.

Wolrdcoin, which was co-founded by Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT developer OpenAI, is an identity and cryptocurrency protocol that uses iris scans to verify users. The company has designed its own hardware, known as the Orb, to do so, and claims that the biometric data doesn't leave the device and is erased, unless users consent to Worldcoin holding onto it. After the project's launch in July, Orb-verified users could receive airdrops of the Worldcoin token.  In a TV interview on Wednesday morning, Eliud Owalo, Kenya's minister for the digital economy, said Worldcoin is lawful within the scope of the country's data-collection rules. Owalo also said that the Office of Data Protection Commissioner, or ODPC, was in contact with Worldcoin as far back as April, and had concluded that its activities comply with Kenya's data-protection laws.  ""There could be security issues around it [Worldcoin]. There could be regulatory issues around it which we need to improve,"" but as far as the Data Protection Act of 2019 is concerned, ""they were acting within the law,"" Owalo said.  Around the same time of the TV interview on Wednesday, Kenya's Ministry of the Interior said it suspended the project's operations in the country, citing concerns over financial security and data protection.  Authorities in the U.K., France and Germany are also looking into the project.  In Kenya and later on Wednesday, the ODPC, along with the Communications Authority, issued their own statement, saying that after a preliminary review, they found ""a number of legitimate regulatory concerns"" around the project. These include a lack of clarity of the security and storage of the sensitive data collected, obtaining consent in exchange for money ""which borders on inducement"" and the aggregation of massive amounts of citizen data in the hands of private actors.  For its part, the Worldcoin Foundation said that it stopped its operations in Kenya due to ""crowd control"" issues, despite the government entities' statements. Worldcoin said that during the pause of operations, it would work to make ""more robust"" crowd control measures and ""work with local officials to increase understanding of the privacy measures and commitments Worldcoin implements,"" according to a statement given to CoinDesk.  “The demand for Worldcoin’s proof-of-personhood verification services in Kenya has been overwhelming, resulting in tens of thousands of individuals waiting in lines over a two-day period to secure a World ID.

More specifically, all trading fees will be waived for BTC/FDUSD, and maker fees will be 0% on ETH/FDUSD until further notice as part of Binance's campaign.  The listing comes as Binance is aiming to diversify trading volumes between stablecoin pairs following this year's regulatory clampdown on Binance USD (BUSD), with New York state regulators forcing BUSD issuer Paxos to halt issuing the stablecoin in February.  Following that action, Binance promoted trading with TrueUSD (TUSD) by waiving fees. TUSD trading volume mushroomed since and its market capitalization grew to nearly $3 billion.  Binance listed FDUSD on July 26 with zero trading fees to convert the token to other stablecoins including USDT and TUSD, indicating that the promotion would include all existing and new FDUSD trading pairs.

42392782,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgBLAD,1691077500,Assessing Custody Solutions in Digital Assets,"Meet James. In 2013, this Welsh IT worker threw away a hard drive holding a digital wallet containing 7,500 bitcoin, which today would have a market value of nearly USD 217 million. Since then, he has been on a campaign to get access to the local garbage dump to find this lost fortune, to no avail. This case is not unique, and James, like many of us, has learned that not realizing the tenuous nature of digital records comes with a penalty. Digital currencies are a growing storage and retrieval concern, and advisors must understand the safety mechanisms available.  The adoption of digital assets requires the ability for investors to securely store their investments and recover them if keys are lost. Depending on where you live, regulatory frameworks for crypto custody exist and follow the same rules as holding money and other investments.  As advisors, how can you support your client in making informed investment and custody decisions?  In today's discussion, Jason Hall and John McNiff from Methodic Capital Management introduce crypto custody solutions from self-storage to “custody as a service.” They discuss how the transparency of the blockchain can help support your custody considerations and help advisors start to navigate the services and options available to them..  Over the coming months, we will continue to dive deeper into topics like custody to help build your knowledge in this ever-changing space and demonstrate how technology and regulatory pieces come together for your clients. Stay tuned.  Happy reading.  – S.M.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  How to Think About Custody of Digital Assets  Digital asset custody – having direct access to the assets’ cryptographic keys – is an important and often required component of crypto investment management. However, there is greater complexity in digital asset custody due to technological and regulatory challenges that necessitate greater due diligence by the advisor. By utilizing a robust framework, custodial solutions can be objectively and thoroughly assessed, enabling an advisor to unlock the unique benefits of digital asset custody. Here we review the basics of our framework which can be expanded to fit individual needs.  Unlike traditional assets, custody of digital assets introduces unique operational challenges and opportunities. On the blockchain, anyone can view wallet balances and transactions, but only private key holders can transfer assets. This immutable transparency applies universally, without the possibility of administrative overrides. This inflexibility means that everyone, including institutions, is governed by the same rules.  Categories of digital asset custody  Digital asset custody typically falls into two categories: self-custody and custody services.  Self-custody, an important and often lauded aspect of crypto, enables individuals to manage their digital assets independently. While third party providers can facilitate this process through wallet services and hardware solutions, the inherent risks and control lie with the individual.  In contrast, custody services offer an experience akin to traditional asset custodians. For asset managers and advisors, custody services are the likelier choice given regulatory interpretations, risk management, technical capabilities, and best practices. These custody service providers oversee asset movements, settlement times, and security. However, lack of standardization due to insufficient regulation presents a challenge to advisors.  Choosing a custody solution: A recommended framework  While by no means comprehensive, below is a high-level overview of our assessment framework.  Regulatory considerations  Digital asset custody brings its own legal obligations. For instance, in jurisdictions like the United States, registered investment advisors must use ""qualified custodians."" While the specific parameters of this designation are not yet clearly defined for digital assets, this prerequisite favors more regulated entities. Globally, licensing and regulatory mandates can vary widely with some countries not requiring licensing at all.  Given the pending status of digital-asset legislation in the U.S. and throughout the world, working with custodians that have clear regulatory requirements and robust internal frameworks helps protect against fraud and ensures business integrity.  Transparency measures  Custodians should offer a certain level of transparency. Do they conduct comprehensive audits not only on their financials but their IT, risk management, and infosecurity procedures? Blockchain-based custody can offer high transparency through technologies like proof of reserves, with the potential to reduce fraud and irresponsible financial behavior. Proof of reserves enables companies to demonstrate to all participants that customer-pledged assets are held securely.  We spoke at length on this issue with Henrik Gebbing, COO of Finoa who said, “Qualified custodians [in Germany] must comply with the same IT regulation as other financial institutions, [and] regulators don’t distinguish between crypto and traditional assets. (...) Do you follow the latest standards of information security? This is where you’ll find a lot of players that are not fully audited.”  While on-chain commitments can be transparently verified, off-chain commitments require additional scrutiny. Therefore, further steps (like an audit) are necessary to ensure companies are not engaging in unauthorized rehypothecation, commingling or off-chain pledging of assets.  Compatibility with investment strategy  Sometimes it’s unclear whether the custodian can actually custody the assets required to support the investment strategy. Depending on technological limitations and regulatory restraints, custodians often support different asset mixes. Getting specific assurances of all relevant assets will prevent the need for multiple custodians.  Oftentimes, high velocity trading strategies and permissionless DeFi are not supported by many of the more regulated custodians. The fit with a custodian is a two-way street, the custodian must be able to support the execution of the advisor’s strategy “Supporting institutional relationships requires alignment of strategy, market access [execution/trade settlement], custody, and associated reporting,” says Kevin Hall, COO of Etana Custody.  Be deliberate in due diligence  Digital asset custody is complex and must be seriously considered. We have provided a basic framework but the actual process must include a number of technical considerations like structure and private key management. Choosing the right custodian requires careful analysis of regulatory rules, security measures and transparency. However, with the appropriate diligence and resources, digital asset custody can offer more safety, transparency, and cost efficiency than traditional models of custody.  –Jason Hall and John McNiff of Methodic Capital Management  Ask an Advisor  I help clients include crypto in their retirement accounts.  – Bryan Courchesne, CEO Daim  Q: Can my client move their existing crypto to an IRA?  A: IRS rules dictate that contributions to IRAs can only be done in fiat. Digital assets can not be placed into an IRA. They must be sold to cash first.  Q: What type of retirement accounts can my client hold crypto in?  A: As far as the types of accounts that can be serviced, you will have plenty of options including Traditional, Roth, SIMPLE, and SEP IRAs as well Individual 401(k)s and Profit Sharing Plans (PSP). If you have an old 401(k) from a previous employer, you can roll that into a Digital Asset IRA. If you have an active 401(k) you most likely cannot withdraw assets to invest in an IRA. This would necessitate an in-service withdrawal that most plans do not allow. DAIM can help on this front. They are currently a 3(38) fiduciary for employer sponsored 401(k) plans with direct bitcoin exposure.

42392772,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgBKQ3,1691077117,"Tether Is Going on a Bitcoin Buying Spree, but It Should Be Holding Cash","One of the most absurd things in crypto right now is Tether's quarterly profits. The company, known as much for its controversies as its market-leading stablecoin USDT, has about 60 employees and quarterly profits above $1 billion. (At least that’s what the company is attesting to, in its latest exercise in rebuilding trust.)  Honestly, on its face, I can’t believe it. At all. Yet despite the company’s history of stating occasional half truths and outright lies, there’s no real reason to disbelieve this figure. But it just seems crazy.  On Monday, Tether released a new quarterly attestation that had some interesting metrics.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  First, Tether holds a lot of U.S. Treasuries and a lot less private debt. Of note, it holds $55.8 billion of U.S. Treasury bills (boring old government bonds with less than 90-day maturities), $8.9 billion of overnight reverse repurchase agreements (loans financial institutions make to fulfill lending requirements) and $8.1 billion of money market funds (effectively cash). If Tether was a country, its U.S. Treasury bill horde alone would put it as the 24th largest foreign holder of treasury securities in the world nestled just between Mexico and Thailand. That in and of itself is pretty remarkable.  Second, the amount of assets Tether shows in its attestation report exceeds $86 billion which is a few billion higher than USDT’s market capitalization right now. It is worth mentioning that $2.4 billion of that is “Other Investments,” which could literally be anything. In any event, assets exceed liabilities for Tether which means it’s running an equity surplus.  Now, I admit these two things don’t feel outright unbelievable, but this from a company blog post does: “Tether’s operational profits are over $1B for the time period of April 2023 to June 2023, which corresponds to a significant 30% increase quarter over quarter.”  Ooowee.  From a per-capita perspective, Tether might honestly be a world leader in U.S. Treasuries held per-capita and operating profit per-capita. $1 billion is certainly a lot of money to take in for a company with so few employees. What could explain the company’s outsized profits?  Tether’s profitability makes sense in the context of the amount of Treasuries it holds. Interest rates have gone up a lot over the last year and Tether’s business clearly benefits from that. One-month Treasuries yield 5.378% right now, USDT yields nothing, Tether collects the difference. If you hold billions of dollars worth of Treasuries then you’re sitting on a cash cow.  Not bad work if you can get it.  There’s a lot of noise around what Tether is doing or could do with all this newfound profitability, as there has been talk about how it should reinvest its customers’ USDT collateral for years. Tether already holds $1.7 billion of bitcoin and it’s investing in other related avenues like sustainable bitcoin mining in Uruguay and a Georgia-based payment processor. Maybe Tether can buy more bitcoin or invest in a bunch more companies.  I propose an alternative. Perhaps Tether can stash some cash on its balance sheet. While U.S. Treasuries, reverse repos and money market funds are liquid (and if they become illiquid we’ll have some big problems), they aren’t quite cash.  Tether actually has let its cash balance dwindle to just $90.8 million. Down from $481 million in March 2023 and $5.3 billion in December 2022.  The dwindling is probably just Tether rolling cash into Treasuries because they yield 5.378% instead of nothing, but the trend isn’t encouraging. I know inflation is running hot and that U.S. Treasuries are basically equivalent to cash, but a lack of actual cash is exactly what doomed Silicon Valley Bank. If there is a run for USDT redemptions it would suit Tether to have more cash than less cash.  See also: Stablecoins: A Potential Counter to De-Dollarization | Opinion  In all, the speculation around Tether and USDT won’t subside, especially now that the company is apparently printing more money than it knows what to do with. The company for years has been plagued by regulatory issues in the U.S., which likely won’t abate.  However, there’s a very big, important caveat: Assurances and attestations are not audits. They are nothing like audits and should not be treated as such. Given the regulatory heat and legal costs Tether has already incurred, it’s unlikely the firm is lying – but attestations could certainly let it. Audits are performed to discover issues that may not have been known prior to the audit and attestations simply review how true data or information is when compared to a stated purpose.  So while attestations are a nice, rubber stamp on figures a company passes along, they don’t hold a candle to the real thing.",NEUTRAL,USDT,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/03/tether-is-going-on-a-bitcoin-buying-spree-but-it-should-be-holding-cash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/677999a6aa0f0e300eeaed71fdeebfba21ed830d-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392785,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgBLKT,1691075258,Solana Tokens or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Points,"SALT LAKE CITY — The way Barrett from Cypher Protocol sees it, Solana’s comeback depends on one thing: tokens.  Specifically, new tokens from teams on the Solana blockchain that haven’t issued them before. They’re the key to driving liquidity, trading activity and most important, new users into a decentralized finance ecosystem that sorely needs all three.  Barrett, the founder of crypto trading platform Cypher, sat down with CoinDesk on day two of this summer’s mtnDAO, the biannual “hacker house” now in its fourth edition. He’s the event’s emcee and chief organizer, and via Cypher its main sponsor, alongside MarginFi, an on-chain lending platform.  The two have charged up Solana’s growth leaderboard in recent weeks partly because of loyalty programs that give “points” to crypto traders who participate in their respective markets. These points aren’t themselves tokens, but nearly everyone amassing them is convinced they’ll transmogrify into a token payday—possibly soon.  Barrett, who has gone by his mononym first name at least since Cypher launched in 2021, won’t confirm whether the crypto lending startup is on the cusp of launching a token or will ever hold an airdrop. It hardly matters; all those askers of “wen Cypher airdrop” are plowing their points-earning capital through Cypher's markets for trading crypto assets like SOL, ETH and BTC anyway.  This excitement is giving Cypher its first taste of success after three years and just as many pivots. On Wednesday Cypher v3 (Barrett describes it as a “generalized decentralized exchange”) crossed $2 million in total deposits for the first time ever.  Getting it right could help determine whether Solana DeFi returns to its multibillion-dollar heights or instead trudges down the long road to irrelevance.  “We’re consistently ranking top five in growth across one-, seven- and 30-day periods in the Solana ecosystem on both users and TVL,” said Barrett, referring to DeFi's total vale locked metric. The protocol has grown 1,384% since launching a liquidity incentives program and more than doubled since debuting points, he added. Trading “volume is picking up on spot and perps” markets, referring to perpetual futures contracts.  Cypher is part of what Barrett calls “Solana DeFi 2.0,” a loose confederation of protocols that are hitting their stride deep in the super fast blockchain’s bear market. Many of the teams were around during Solana’s heyday in summer and fall 2021 when token-linked protocols like Mango Markets, Saber and Serum commanded the ecosystem’s attention.  See also: Serum Token Becomes Latest Project in Bankman-Fried Empire to Turn Heads (2021)  Blowups, scandals and the specter of FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried have, respectively, deleveraged that trio’s influence over the Solana ecosystem almost as much as they’ve nuked their token prices. Other erstwhile leaders have followed similar descents, albeit under less spectacular circumstances.  If Barrett is to be believed, a new breed of Solana protocols that never launched tokens are getting ready to take control.  When it comes to launching tokens in the new paradigm, “you get to observe those mistakes and stand on the shoulders” of those past teams, Barrett said. Among other things, that means designing better tokenomics, how a team divides up its allocations. It also remains to be seen how the Internal Revenue Service's new guidance on taxing airdrops will impact Solana DeFi's rebirth.  Getting it right could help determine whether Solana DeFi returns to its multibillion-dollar heights or instead trudges down the long road to irrelevance. The Solana ecosystem’s recent pump in TVL growth has stalled around $310 million even as Cypher and others continue up. This indicates new capital isn’t flowing in; now, it's old money sloshing about.  Barrett has a pragmatic if cynically-tinged vision of the crypto markets that the author of this column most certainly shares. Degenerate traders only want one thing, and it's disgusting (err, I mean money). Free tokens are money. Therefore, the degens want free tokens. They’ll go where the tokens are and they’ll do what they must to get them. If that means trading, they’ll do so on leverage; if that means staking, they’ll loop for more.  Solana DeFi 2.0 will be there, incentivizing them all the way. That could make a feedback loop of crypto’s downward spiral.  “They’re creating a lot of excitement that was missing from the Solana narrative for the last 18 months,” Barrett said of the incentive protocols.",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | AIRDROP,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/08/03/solana-tokens-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-points,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/03b5b7483efa1dbf421639f1dbb8382f1123971f-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15597901,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545657,1691074507,Why The Uniswap (UNI) Token Is Almost Worthless: Researcher,"In an analysis, Anders Helseth, Vice President at K33 Research, has mounted a strong case against the viability of the Uniswap (UNI) token. His analysis pivots on the intriguing dynamics of the decentralized finance (DeFi) market, fundamentally challenging the current valuation and future potential of UNI. Helseth begins his argument with a seemingly straightforward question: “The Uniswap protocol generates significant trading fees, but will the UNI token ever capture its (fair) share?” His conclusion is emphatically negative. Is The Uniswap (UNI) Token Worthless? For context, UNI is a governance token for the Uniswap protocol, a decentralized exchange that earns a 0.3% fee on trades. However, as Helseth points out, the entire trading fee currently goes to liquidity providers, with UNI holders standing to gain only if governance votes permit fee dividends to UNI holders. Related Reading: Uniswap Delists HEX Token After SEC Deems It An “Unregistered Security” Even in a slow DeFi market, the fully diluted value of the UNI token is 15 times the annualized trading fees paid when using the protocol, currently around $6 billion. If the UNI token could capture all trading fees, it would arguably present an irresistible buy. However, Helseth makes a compelling argument to the contrary. “The UNI token currently captures 0% of the 0.3% trading fee, which entirely goes to liquidity providers,” Helseth says, emphasizing the token’s current lack of intrinsic value. The crux of his argument revolves around three players in the DeFi space: the users, the protocol (and hence UNI token), and the liquidity providers. According to Helseth, the interplay between these actors is detrimental to the UNI token’s potential for revenue generation. Helseth explains: The entire protocol can be exactly copied within minutes at virtually no cost. This argument implies that all the power lies with the liquidity providers in the fight for trading fees. The primary concern for users is liquidity and cost-effectiveness. If the same protocol can be replicated at a whim, users would inevitably gravitate towards the version with the most liquidity – to minimize slippage when executing trades. This dynamic significantly empowers liquidity providers who, unlike UNI holders, hold real, valuable tokens. Related Reading: Uniswap Launches UniswapX Protocol, Sparking 3% Surge In UNI’s Price In addition, even though switching to another smart contract may entail some costs, these are relatively low, reinforcing the bargaining power of liquidity providers. Concluding, Helseth states: “Given this relatively low cost of switching from the users’ perspective, we cannot conclude with anything else than that the power lies with the liquidity providers. Hence, even though the Uniswap protocol generates significant trading fees, we believe the potential for the UNI token to capture any of this revenue to be almost non-existent.” At press time, the UNI price stood at $6.19 after being rejected at the 200-day EMA yesterday.

Among these is copy trading, enabling traders to emulate the strategies of successful peers. Tradecurve also includes AI-assisted automated trading, staking for passive income, and substantial leverage of up to 500:1. Market sentiment towards Tradecurve is overwhelmingly positive, as demonstrated by the successful sale of over 100 million tokens in the fourth phase of the presale. Now in phase 5 for $0.025 per token, market analysts predict that the price of TCRV could surge to well over $1.00 in the next year. Some market watchers have even drawn comparisons between the potential growth trajectory of Tradecurve and the rise of Binance. The latter started at a mere $0.11 during its ICO phase and has since ballooned to over $600. If these predictions materialize, early TCRV investors could see significant returns once the token is listed on major exchanges. Huobi (HT) Faces Regulatory Pressure Huobi, a top global cryptocurrency exchange, finds itself in choppy waters as its token price has plunged an alarming 93% to just $2.66. This steep Huobi decline is largely attributable to the crypto winter which has caused the entire digital asset market to suffer. However, there is no denying that Huobi is under increasing pressure from regulators, as well as the competition. For instance, Huobi was forced to shut its operations in Malaysia, a market where it had been flourishing. An analysis of Huobi's daily trading chart reveals a discernible descending triangle pattern, indicating that Huobi's price is trapped in a downward spiral. Although a reversal might be possible, breaking through the formidable $3.00 resistance level presents a substantial obstacle for the Huobi token. Moreover, Tradecurve's debut in crypto trading could effectively take a slice of Huobi's market share away, eating into its profits and further depressing its token price.

BALD Meme Coin’s Volume Shaved By 96%,"A sequence of unfortunate developments has struck BALD meme coin enthusiasts, as the once-shining (no pun intended) digital asset has experienced a jaw-dropping 96% decline in trading volume. The root cause of this worrying situation stems from the withdrawal of more than 6,000 Ether in liquidity from the meme coin’s smart contracts, an action that has cast a foreboding cloud over the asset’s prospects. Removing such a substantial amount of liquidity had an immediate and profound impact, triggering an abrupt and steep decline in BALD’s price. Related Reading: Kaspa (KAS) Takes Off With 23% Burst – What’s Fueling The Thrust? Currently, the price of BALD stands at $0.01101692, according to CoinGecko data. Within the past 24 hours, BALD has experienced a significant price decline of 57.31%. Explosive Rise And Suspicion Surrounding BALD Coin BALD coin underwent an unprecedented surge in value within a single day immediately after its launch. However, this meteoric rise was soon followed by a sequence of perplexing actions that cast a shadow of doubt over the project’s legitimacy. The vigilant eyes of the Onchain Intrigue Telegram Channel turned towards BALD’s wallet activities (see image below) after a sudden withdrawal of liquidity. This subsequent investigation brought to light a set of alarming indications commonly associated with a phenomenon known as a “rug pull.” Source: Onchain Intrigue Telegram Channel In the intricate world of cryptocurrencies, a rug pull constitutes a type of scam in which the creators or promoters of a token vanish after attracting investment, leaving participants high and dry with their funds pilfered. Rug pulls have earned a notorious reputation in cryptocurrency, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi). These incidents transpire when developers execute an elaborate ruse, projecting an image of authenticity around their project, only to swiftly abscond after removing the liquidity, leaving investors in the lurch. Darkening Clouds Of Skepticism Compounding the unease, recent speculation has arisen linking BALD coin to Alameda, a prominent quantitative cryptocurrency trading firm. While these connections are yet to be substantiated, the mere existence of such ties threatens to deepen the ongoing crisis surrounding BALD. Bitcoin holds at $29K on TradingView.com This potential association also raises pertinent questions about the community’s trust in analogous projects, further amplifying the sense of uncertainty that shrouds the cryptocurrency landscape.

Several top legal and compliance executives have left the exchange in recent weeks, reportedly because of the strain of dealing with multiple investigations into its practices, although Binance denies this is the case.  Hecht is a familiar face at Binance, having previously served as the global head of corporate compliance at the exchange for the past eight months, after working as the chief compliance officer at Meta’s crypto wallet project, Novi Financial, for less than two years. Earlier in her career, Hecht was a senior policy advisor at the U.S. Department of the Treasury.  In her new role, Hecht will primarily work on the company’s compliance program while also engaging with regulators, intergovernmental organizations and industry bodies, according to a press release. She will be working closely with Noah Perlman, who is replacing Hecht as Chief Compliance Officer.  The appointment comes as Binance continues to be at the forefront of U.S. lawmakers’ crackdown on crypto actors. In March, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued Binance and Zhao on allegations the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S. against federal law.  Later in June, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) followed suit and sued the exchange on allegations of violating federal securities laws.  It was revealed on Wednesday that U.S. Department of Justice officials are even considering fraud charges against Binance, but could resort to fines and deferred or non-prosecution to avoid threatening the entire crypto industry and creating a bank run, people familiar with the matter said.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED | BNB,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/08/03/binance-appoints-new-compliance-officer-as-regulatory-crackdown-intensifies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/542c267ea29ce93813ebd28b5818ddad8c6ac9fe-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42419807,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFzJd,1691071200,"NFT Trading Volume Is Sinking, But It’s Not Stopping Developers From Entering Web3","Data from Web3 developer platform Alchemy shows while NFT trading volume fell 41% in Q2, nearly six million smart contracts were deployed across EVM-compatible chains  Although fewer collectors are trading NFTs, more developers are focusing on building new use cases to bring Web3 technologies mainstream  The past few months have been rough for non-fungible token (NFT) trading. But it appears builders are still bullish on Web3.  According to developer platform Alchemy’s latest Web3 Development Report, while NFT trading volume fell 41% in the second quarter of 2023, 5.9 million smart contracts were deployed across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible networks including Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon. This number represents a 302% increase since Q1, and a 1,107% increase since the second quarter of 2022.  In addition, 26.8 million Ethereum software developer kits (SDKs) were installed in Q2, a 7% increase from the previous quarter.  While not all of the new smart contracts deployed or Ethereum SDKs installed will be used to build NFTs, continued development points to a positive direction for Web3’s growth and its steps toward mass adoption. Despite the bear market, Ethereum’s price has increased 12% since last year.  Blake Tandowsky, growth analyst at Alchemy, told CoinDesk that whale NFT trading volumes peaked in Q2 2022, and now, less users are entering the market. Still, the emerging use cases for NFTs such as gaming have kept developers hungry to build on the blockchain.  “We saw pretty strong new users in Q2 2022, but as time went on, the number of new users entering the space for NFT volume basically wasn't able to sustain that level of growth, which is why today we're kind of seeing a lower number than usual,” said Tandowsky. “One thing that kind of stands out is the need for additional use cases for some NFTs … there could be a lot of future NFT use cases that look very different from their original JPEG iteration.”  The report highlighted several standout Web3 use cases last quarter that included shoe retailer Nike’s Our Force 1 collection drop, the growth of decentralized social media platform Lens Protocol and gaming marketplace Google Play’s support for games that have integrated NFTs.  “There's obviously a lot of developers who build on Google, and I think the ability for them to now deploy certain integrations with [decentralized apps] is really just exciting for gaming, for NFTs, for all parts of the blockchain ecosystem,” said Tandowsky. “It reduces the friction or barriers of where you can and cannot deploy dapps.”  Despite efforts to bring Web3 mainstream, NFTs have experienced dramatic ups and downs in terms of trading volume since the beginning of 2023. In March, NFT trading volume reached a high of $2 billion, a number not seen since the Terra death spiral, that some say was a catalyst for the bear market. Yet in mid-May, trading volume was on track to fall below $1 billion – the lowest since January. Since then, popular NFT collections have lost substantial value from their bull market highs, including Azuki and Bored Ape Yacht Club.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ARB,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/08/03/nft-trading-volume-is-sinking-but-its-not-stopping-developers-from-entering-web3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4676822cce676537db414efa3296c8bcee837f7-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419808,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFzKf,1691070263,Stablecoins: A Potential Counter to De-Dollarization,"As the global economy continues to absorb geopolitical tensions, we see increasing speculation that the U.S. dollar’s global dominance could wane, with a steady decline in the dollar’s share of central bank reserves and increasing de-dollarization efforts among BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and other emerging markets.  Yiannis Giokas is senior director of production innovation at Moody’s Analytics.  While the dollar is likely to remain the dominant reserve currency globally in the near future, domestic and foreign policies could erode its overall dominance. Amid these shifts, U.S. regulated fiat-backed stablecoins may offer a novel counter-narrative that can enhance the dollar's global power and mitigate the impacts of de-dollarization.  The current global economic landscape is marked by an increased tendency among nations to diversify their reserves away from the U.S. dollar, exacerbated by the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes to tackle domestic inflation. Small, but growing allocations to other major currencies, have reduced the U.S. dollar's share of central bank holdings to 58% in the last quarter of 2022, from 71% in 2000.  Concurrently, the shadow economy — a sector comprising economic activities that are not officially recorded in a country's gross domestic product (GDP) due to their illicit nature or the desire to avoid taxes and regulations — continues to be a significant part of many economies. Here, the U.S. dollar often serves as a preferred medium of exchange due to its stability and widespread acceptance.  For example, in countries with high inflation like Turkey and Argentina, with rates of 38.2% and 115.6% (as of June 2023), respectively, residents scramble to convert their income and savings into U.S. dollars for protection. Meanwhile, they face capital controls limiting foreign currency holdings and a central bank-set currency exchange rate that may undervalue their currency by up to 50%, as witnessed with Argentina's peso.  Consequently, everyday consumers have been utilizing decentralized finance (DeFi), seeking refuge in stablecoins — digital representations of a fiat currency — thus overcoming these economic constraints.  [T]okens could provide an additional tool for maintaining the global financial influence of the U.S. dollar.  Amid this complexity, U.S. regulated fiat-backed stablecoins present a potential solution. These digital tokens are pegged to the value of a fiat currency, typically the U.S. dollar, and are designed to maintain a stable value relative to the underlying asset. They can offer the stability of the U.S. dollar combined with the flexibility and technological advantages of cryptocurrency, providing a novel financial tool that can help solidify the dollar's position in the global economy.  As the regulatory landscape around stablecoins in the U.S. evolves, it is becoming clear that these digital assets could play a critical role in mitigating the impact of de-dollarization of the global economy, which, if left unchecked, could cause inflationary and cost of borrowing pressures for the U.S.  Recent inquiries from the U.S. Senate’s Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee to stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle highlight the growing awareness of the potential risks as well as benefits associated with these digital tokens.  Jeremy Allaire, the CEO of Circle, has noted that well-regulated stablecoins can help reinforce the U.S. dollar's position in the global economy. He argues that if the Federal Reserve can gain control over non-bank stablecoin issuers, it can ensure these tokens are backed by secure assets, such as dollars or Treasury bills. This move could facilitate the introduction of a digital dollar into the core global economy, providing a robust counter to non-dollar trade regimes.  See also: Circle CEO: US Stablecoin Legislation Is 'Lowest-Hanging Fruit'  Furthermore, U.S. regulated fiat-backed stablecoins could play a significant role in countries in which the dollar is currently widely-used outside the formal economy i.e. the shadow economy.  By replacing shadow U.S. dollars with blockchain-trackable digital tokens, these stablecoins could offer a more transparent and regulated alternative for transactions, thereby reducing the risks associated with the shadow economy.  See also: The Real Use Case for CBDCs: Dethroning the Dollar  That said, as private enterprises, stablecoin issuers may be subject to fewer restrictions than alternatives such as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) or tokenized deposits when expanding into new markets. This provides them with greater flexibility and potential for growth, if they comply with their U.S. regulatory obligations.  In conclusion, U.S. regulated fiat-backed stablecoins offer a potential strategy to counter de-dollarization efforts. By leveraging the stability of the U.S. dollar and the flexibility of digital currencies, these tokens could provide an additional tool for maintaining the global financial influence of the U.S. dollar.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT,Yiannis Giokas ,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/03/stablecoins-a-potential-counter-to-de-dollarization,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bda8ab805f9144673cc3851c5c270b2f6235b794-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Designed to meet a crucial market need, this innovative index provides a wide-ranging and quantifiable assessment of fear and greed for the entire cryptocurrency industry. Amid recent market turbulence, it became evident that there is no crypto equivalent of the traditional Fear and Greed Index, a well-established tool for stock market analysis. Existing alternatives in the crypto space focus solely on Bitcoin, failing to capture the overall market sentiment of 20,000+ coins listed on CoinMarketCap. The CMC Crypto Fear And Greed index leverages an array of key components, meticulously engineered to provide users with valuable insights into the overall sentiment of the crypto market: Price Momentum: The index analyzes the price performance of the top 10 crypto coins by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins) through CoinMarketCap's API. By capturing trends in assets like BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, and DOGE, it provides a more holistic view of market sentiment, as price fluctuations mirror fear and greed levels in the market. Volatility: Recognizing volatility's significant impact on market sentiment, the CMC Crypto Fear and Greed Index integrates the Volmex Implied Volatility Indices, BVIV and EVIV, capturing fluctuations across a broad selection of digital assets and reflecting crucial market data for enhanced decision-making. Derivatives Market: Option contracts provide insights into market participants' expectations for future returns. The put-call ratio is utilized to infer the sentiment of retail participants in the option markets. A higher ratio of puts to calls signals fear in the market, indicating that retail investors anticipate a bear market or a future crash. Market Composition: The relative aggregate value of BTC in the market serves as a vital indicator of market sentiment. The Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) is employed for this purpose, measuring the ratio between Bitcoin's market capitalization and the total market capitalization of major stablecoins. A low SSR indicates a relatively larger stablecoin supply compared to BTC, while a high SSR signifies stronger BTC dominance. This metric not only represents the supply/demand dynamics between BTC and USD but also reflects the composition of the market. CMC Proprietary Data: CoinMarketCap analyzes social trend keyword search data, such as phrases like ""crypto moon,"" to gauge market sentiment. Additionally, as a major traffic platform in the crypto industry, CoinMarketCap collects valuable pageview and engagement data, providing insights into market sentiment, retail interest, and emerging trends. By examining user engagement and behavior, the index identifies which coins and projects are generating the most interest, and which themes are driving market sentiment. With its comprehensive approach, the CoinMarketCap’s Crypto Fear and Greed Index provides a uniquely valuable perspective on the cryptocurrency market, empowering users to make better-informed decisions based on a deeper understanding of market sentiment. As a global leader in cryptocurrency data and research analysis, CoinMarketCap is committed to building innovative tools and resources for participants in the crypto industry. About CoinMarketCap CoinMarketCap is the world's most-referenced price-tracking website for crypto assets in the rapidly growing cryptocurrency space. Its mission is to make crypto discoverable and efficient globally by empowering retail users with unbiased, high quality and accurate information for drawing their own informed conclusions.

Volatility: Recognizing volatility's significant impact on market sentiment, the CMC Crypto Fear and Greed Index integrates the Volmex Implied Volatility Indices, BVIV and EVIV, capturing fluctuations across a broad selection of digital assets and reflecting crucial market data for enhanced decision-making. Derivatives Market: Option contracts provide insights into market participants' expectations for future returns. The put-call ratio is utilized to infer the sentiment of retail participants in the option markets. A higher ratio of puts to calls signals fear in the market, indicating that retail investors anticipate a bear market or a future crash. Market Composition: The relative aggregate value of BTC in the market serves as a vital indicator of market sentiment. The Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) is employed for this purpose, measuring the ratio between Bitcoin's market capitalization and the total market capitalization of major stablecoins. A low SSR indicates a relatively larger stablecoin supply compared to BTC, while a high SSR signifies stronger BTC dominance. This metric not only represents the supply/demand dynamics between BTC and USD but also reflects the composition of the market. CMC Proprietary Data: CoinMarketCap analyzes social trend keyword search data, such as phrases like ""crypto moon,"" to gauge market sentiment. Additionally, as a major traffic platform in the crypto industry, CoinMarketCap collects valuable pageview and engagement data, providing insights into market sentiment, retail interest, and emerging trends. By examining user engagement and behavior, the index identifies which coins and projects are generating the most interest, and which themes are driving market sentiment. With its comprehensive approach, the CoinMarketCap’s Crypto Fear and Greed Index provides a uniquely valuable perspective on the cryptocurrency market, empowering users to make better-informed decisions based on a deeper understanding of market sentiment. As a global leader in cryptocurrency data and research analysis, CoinMarketCap is committed to building innovative tools and resources for participants in the crypto industry.

15594946,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545626,1691067655,"Bitstamp Teases Major XRP Announcement, But The Market Hesitates","In a cryptic move that has the XRP army speculating, Europe’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, Bitstamp, has teased a significant announcement related to the token. The Luxembourg-based exchange made this known via a tweet that simply read, “tomorrow,” accompanied by the XRP-themed hashtags #XRP, #XRPL and #XRPLedger and a suggestive video. The video, a brief animation showing an XRP rocket ascending, indicates that the forthcoming announcement could potentially result in significant news for the XRP Ledger, eventually boosting the price. However, Bitstamp stopped short of offering any explicit hints about what this announcement might entail, leaving the community buzzing with anticipation. Tomorrow.#XRP #XRPL #XRPLedger pic.twitter.com/aZrKAjXK5j — Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) August 2, 2023 What Might Be Bitstamp’s Announcement? XRP’s followers were quick to respond, sharing their theories on what Bitstamp’s forthcoming announcement might involve. Panos, the founder of Digital Generation Finance, expressed his belief that Bitstamp could be set to announce a full integration with the XRP Ledger (XRPL). “The announcement could reveal that DEX has been connected to Bitstamp’s order book, focusing on fiat ramps for payments,” Panos conjectured. Related Reading: Here’s The Total Number Of XRP That Ripple Currently Holds This notion was seconded by prominent XRP community member @XRPcryptowolf, who also postulated that Bitstamp could be planning an XRPL integration. Meanwhile, another XRP fan named @wEeZiE posited that Bitstamp’s announcement might have something to do with Ripple’s recent minority stake acquisition in the exchange. Back in May, Ripple acquired a stake in Bitstamp in a bid to expand its international operations and diversify its offerings beyond payments. A transcript of the Galaxy shareholder conference revealed at the time that Ripple had acquired the shares from Pantera Capital, another crypto investment firm based in the US. Pantera was one of Bitstamp’s largest shareholders until 2018, when the exchange was acquired by Belgian investment firm NXMH. However, it is unclear how much Ripple paid for the acquisition or how the deal was structured. Related Reading: XRP To Skyrocket To $500 Within 7 Months, Predicts Wells Fargo Treasury Manager “wEeZiE” stated, “Recall Ripple president Monica Long’s comment about Ripple’s recent stake acquisition in Bitstamp. She mentioned that the move would strengthen Ripple’s international presence and diversify its offerings beyond payments. Perhaps Bitstamp’s tease pertains to this?” Remarkably, Bitstamp has been a major Ripple gateway for years, granting clients access to RippleNet and serving as a key partner for Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL). XRP Investors Don’t Buy The News At press time, the market has not reacted to the announcement of the announcement. On the contrary, XRP has lost key support at $0.6760 and marked a new 3-week low following the summary judgment in the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) case. For now, the price has found support at the 200 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) at $0.6543. If this support breaks as well, a plunge towards $0.60 could be on the cards. On a bullish note, if Bitstamp’s announcement tomorrow can excite XRP investors, the $0.6760 level would be the first resistance. In case of a breakout, a spike up to $0.7249 is likely.

42419805,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFzFV,1691067600,Ether Liquid Staking Protocols Could Double in 2 Years: HashKey,"The ether (ETH) Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) market is poised for explosive growth, potentially adding $24 billion in total value locked over the next two years, according to a new report from HashKey Capital.  Ethereum’s LSD market reached over $22 billion in total value locked (TVL) this year, and the total market capitalization of all LSD projects hit $18 billion, the report says. Staking is a way for crypto holders to put their digital assets to work and earn a passive income without needing to sell them.  The amount of staked ether could reach between 31%-45% of the total ether supply by the end of Q2 2025, which in turn would drive up the value of the LSD market.  “As protocol revenue for LSD protocols directly correlates with ETH prices, liquid staking protocols can be seen as a levered bet on ETH as they gain a stronger market share over staked ETH,” the authors write, arguing that the liquid staking market share will take a sizable amount from solo and CEX staking.  HashKey Capital predicts a possible reduction in staking yields due to an increase in investor participation, but also says that the effects of this can be mitigated because of the composability of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. DeFi refers to lending, borrowing on a blockchain without the help of any intermediaries.  For instance, staked assets could also be used in yield farming, lending, or other income-generating DeFi strategies, creating a layered structure of yield generation that could potentially counterbalance the anticipated reduction in staking yields.  “In the future, any rational actor with have 100% of his or her ETH staked in LSDs,” HashKey’s Henrique Centieiro, one of its senior researchers that co-authored the report, said.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/03/ether-liquid-staking-protocols-could-double-in-2-years-hashkey,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1bf2c6f821ad0fde81c87fd679a2a059997eb245-4516x2540.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Base went live for developers in July so that they could test applications on the new network. Starting Thursday, users will be able to bridge their ether (ETH) to Base, Coinbase wrote in a blog post.  The announcement comes as Coinbase is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings and as it kicked off “Onchain Summer,” a series of events in which creators and developers can make art or build applications on Base. Companies participating include Coca-Cola (KO), gaming powerhouse Atari and non-fungible token platform OpenSea.  The X (formerly Twitter) account for Coinbase Wallet noted that it's already possible to fund ether on Base, even before the live network opens to the public.     Over $68 million worth of ether was bridged to the network last weekend, CoinDesk reported earlier, citing blockchain data from Dune.  Like Coinbase, venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which is also known as a16z, has also made use of the OP Stack and will come out with its own rollup client software, Magi.  “Since we announced Base, our mission has been clear and consistent: bring the next billion users and next million builders on chain,” Jesse Pollak, the creator of Base and head of protocols at Coinbase, said in a press release sent to CoinDesk. “Today, we’re thrilled to announce our next step in that journey.”  Read more: Coinbase’s New Base Blockchain Gobbled Up $68M in Ether, and It’s Not Even Officially Live Yet",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | OP,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/03/coinbase-sets-public-launch-of-base-layer-2-blockchain-for-next-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f572dc358b15e8040445513478fa70837933ce88-3000x1546.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419815,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFzRt,1691065907,First Mover Americas: Justice Department May Charge Binance With Fraud: Report,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Crypto exchange Binance could face U.S. Department of Justice fraud charges, though prosecutors are weighing alternatives given the risk of an FTX-style bank run, news site Semafor reported, citing people familiar with the matter. U.S. officials are worried an indictment could imperil the broader cryptocurrency industry, according to Semafor, and so they are weighing alternatives such as ""fines and deferred or non-prosecution agreements,"" sources told the publication. Binance declined to comment. The Justice Department didn't immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment. It was already publicly known U.S. officials were scrutinizing Binance. Earlier this year, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued the company and founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao for ""willful evasion"" of U.S. laws.  Exchange-traded fund issuer Direxion filed for a bitcoin and ether futures product Wednesday, joining a whole raft of companies that are hoping to launch similar crypto-related trading products in the U.S. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Direxion Bitcoin Ether Strategy ETF would invest in bitcoin and ether futures contracts. The fund may also include investments in other ETFs that have exposure to futures products. The move comes the same week six other companies filed to launch ether futures ETFs. They join a crowded field of crypto ETF hopefuls as the SEC is reviewing more than half a dozen applications to launch a spot bitcoin ETF.  A legion of Twitter bots pumped the price of crypto tokens traded by Sam Bankman-Fried's quant trading firm Alameda Research shortly after FTX listed the tokens, according to a report from the Network Contagion Research Institute. NCRI, an institution that studies cybersecurity and social-media threats, published a report on Wednesday that shows that ""inauthentic chatter"" on Twitter, now X, heavily influenced the prices of five FTX-listed tokens traded by Alameda insiders. The coins were BOBA, GALA, IMX, RNDR and SPELL. Fake tweets regarding the coins surged — by as much as 30% in some cases — after FTX officially listed them, with ""inauthentic"" comments eventually comprising roughly half of all Twitter posts about the tokens.  Chart of the Day  The discount in shares in the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) relative to the fund's net-asset value has narrowed from 41.5% to 37.16% in two days.  The bounce comes as six companies – Volatility Shares, Bitwise, ProShares, Roundhill Investments, VanEck and Grayscale Investments – have applied for exchange-traded funds tied to ether futures.  Speculation is that these applications will be withdrawn by the end of the week, according to Lewis Harland, a portfolio manager at Decentral Park Capital,  ""Despite ETH futures being decidedly liquid and large enough to handle an ETF, this would be considered to be too large of a position change for the SEC,"" Harland said in a market update.  - Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  Wintermute, a Major Trader, Is a Key Player in Arkham’s Controversial Dox-to-Earn Platform  Bankrupt Crypto Lender BlockFi Inches Closer to Refunding Clients  Crypto Hedge Funds Will Shake Up the Industry: Crypto Long & Short",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/03/first-mover-americas-justice-department-may-charge-binance-with-fraud-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f05773178421346ad5b58281dbe68db5a08799d7-1333x999.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bullish Setup Hints At Potential For Advance,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently captured attention due to its price’s downward trajectory. While the current decline in DOGE’s price might raise concerns, astute traders are discerning a potential opportunity amidst the turmoil. As reported by CoinGecko, the DOGE price stands at $0.074288, reflecting a 3.6% drop in the past 24 hours and a 5.2% decline over the past seven days. These figures emphasize the coin’s recent volatility and the challenges that DOGE holders and traders face. Related Reading: Kaspa (KAS) Takes Off With 23% Burst – What’s Fueling The Thrust? However, beneath the surface of these numbers lies an intriguing pattern that might hold the key to future price action. Source: Coingecko Dogecoin Potential For Bullish Continuation Despite the recent price woes, technical analysis unveils a fascinating pattern on DOGE’s four-hour time frame chart – the bullish flag pattern. This pattern, often observed as a continuation signal, consists of a sharp downward slide resembling a flagpole and a consolidation phase marked by parallel trendlines. In DOGE’s case, this pattern is at play, suggesting that the ongoing price decline is a precursor to a bullish resurgence. According to a recent report, the battle between support and resistance levels is evident. DOGE’s price movements within the channel structure reflect this struggle vividly. The support trendline has demonstrated its strength with three discernible bounces, underscoring its importance as a potential rebound point. DOGE market cap reached $10.25 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com Conversely, the overhead resistance has twice thwarted upward price movements, showcasing its influence over trader decisions. These dynamics highlight these levels’ pivotal role in determining potential trend shifts. Historically, flag patterns indicate a temporary pause following a notable price movement, often paving the way for continuing the prior trend. If DOGE’s buyers successfully breach the resistance barrier, an estimated 8% price surge could enable the coin to break through the psychological barrier at $0.085. Divergent Perspectives Amid the optimism surrounding the flag pattern, caution is unveiled in a separate report. The report’s viewpoint suggests a bearish outlook for DOGE, grounded in the coin’s struggles to overcome the resistance of a falling wedge pattern. $DOGE has performed its new Weekly Close below the pattern resistance As a result, #DOGE is potentially set up for a rejection and intra-pattern consolidation Worst case scenario, DOGE could retrace to the very bottom of the market structure#Crypto #Dogecoin https://t.co/K8KUgizgNw pic.twitter.com/sVbLgHlNzd — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) July 31, 2023 DOGE might experience a retracement in a more pessimistic scenario, descending to the wedge’s diagonal support at around $0.055. This divergence in opinions underscores the inherent unpredictability of the cryptocurrency landscape.

According to him, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin offering offers a unique proposition that the spot Bitcoin ETFs cannot emulate. Related Reading: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Is The Best Thing To Happen To Bitcoin, Mike Novogratz Says Saylor echoed similar sentiments during the earnings call on August 1 when he stated that MicroStrategy’s unique “Bitcoin operating strategy” will make it stand out even when spot Bitcoin ETFs arrive. The ex-CEO explained that, “We can tap into leverage because we’re an operating company, which an ETF couldn’t do so we view it as being beneficial to the entire ecosystem.” However, he believes these spot ETFs are good for the crypto industry as they will welcome institutional investors who boast more than enough liquidity into the space. Differentiating his company’s offering from spot ETFs, he stated: We are a unique instrument, we are the sportscar whereas the spot ETF is going to be the supertanker. Spot ETFs will serve another set of customers in a synergistic fashion to grow the entire asset class. MicroStrategy had filed an application to the SEC to sell up to $750 million in Class A common stock. Saylor also confirmed that his company would use the potential proceeds of this stock sale to “acquire Bitcoin.” BTC price remains volatile amid Spot ETF expectations | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com MicroStrategy’s Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Kang, had also confirmed that the proceeds from the proposed sale will be used for “the purchase of Bitcoin as well as the repurchase or repayment of outstanding debt.” Saylor’s Faith In Bitcoin Paying Off Saylor’s MicroStrategy, which happens to be one of the largest holders of Bitcoin, started buying the cryptocurrency in 2020 as a hedge against inflation. The company’s purchases largely resulted from Saylor’s faith in the token as he continued to advocate for it despite the recent market conditions in the crypto market. Saylor stepped down as the CEO a year ago just to focus on the company’s Bitcoin purchasing strategy. This strategy seems to be paying off as it provides an edge for the company over its competitors, with the MSTR stocks rising tremendously since MicroStrategy’s adoption of Bitcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum ETFs Heat Up As Filings With SEC Climbs To Six As revealed by Saylor in a tweet, MicroStrategy’s stocks have risen by 254% since 2020 when it started buying Bitcoin, with this performance putting the company above some key assets and big tech stocks in terms of performance. Saylor is not relenting as he confirmed that the goal is to “accumulate as much Bitcoin as we can” when quizzed about how much more Bitcoin the company intends to add to their existing holdings of 152,800 BTC.

The fake tweets around the coins surged to 30% hours after their listing.  A legion of Twitter bots pumped the price of crypto tokens traded by Sam Bankman-Fried's quant trading firm Alameda Research shortly after FTX listed the tokens, according to a report from Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI).  NCRI, an institution that studies cyber security and social media threats, published a report on Wednesday that shows that ""inauthentic chatter"" on Twitter, now X, heavily influenced the prices of five FTX-listed tokens traded by Alameda insiders.  The coins were BOBA, GALA, IMX, RNDR, and SPELL. Fake tweets regarding the coins surged — by as much as 30% in some cases — after FTX officially listed them, with ""inauthentic"" comments eventually comprising roughly half of all Twitter posts about the tokens.  ""The pattern of account creations and bot-like activities paints a picture of an orchestrated effort, possibly aiming to artificially manipulate market sentiment and trading behavior around these tokens"", the report reads.  Alameda held at least five of the tokens before they were listed on FTX.  A previous report from compliance firm Argus also showed Alameda Research employees leveraged insider information to reap $60 million from several of the tokens named in the NCRI report like IMX, among others, ahead of their listings on FTX.  A CoinDesk report last fall revealed ties between Alameda Research and its sister company, FTX, were unusually close. Later reports revealed executives from Alameda were engaged in FTX's alleged misappropriation of its user funds.  One token they held, Render (RNDR), surged between 11% to 30% within 24 hours on four separate occasions between 2022 and 2023, NCRI's data shows.  NCRI performed a scaled analysis by examining over 3 million tweets mentioning any of 18 tokens that had both been publicly listed on FTX and directly promoted by its official Twitter account between January 1, 2019 and January 27, 2023. Nearly one million of those tweets named any of six tokens featured in the report, including the five held by Alameda.  Bankman-Fried faces federal securities and wire fraud charges, which he will fight at a trial slated for October. He also faces a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission charges (SEC).

For such a large-scale transformation to occur, businesses will need to make “significant upfront investment in physical, digital and human capital to acquire and implement new technologies and reshape business processes,” the report said.  Those investments could reach around $200 billion globally by 2025, and will likely happen before “adoption and efficiency gains start driving major gains in productivity,” the bank said.  Over the longer-term, AI investment could peak at 2.5% to 4% of U.S. GDP, and 1.5% to 2.5% of other AI leaders, the note said.  “Despite this extremely fast growth, the near-term GDP impact is likely to be fairly modest given that AI-related investment currently accounts for a very low share of U.S. and global GDP,” the analysts wrote, adding that while investment so far has been focused on model development, a “substantially larger hardware and software push will be required for generative AI to scale.”  AI adoption will likely start to have a meaningful impact on the U.S. economy sometime between 2025 and 2030, the report added.

42419814,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFzOn,1691057183,Namibia Sets the Stage for National Crypto Strategy With New Law,"Namibia’s new crypto law sets out licensing requirements for firms and mandates the appointment of a regulator to oversee the sector.  Although the law lacks clarity on how crypto will be treated by regulators, the framework will help usher in more comprehensive laws, lawyers in the country say.  Namibia has a new law for crypto and while it provides little clarity for service providers it sets the groundwork for future legislation, according to local legal experts.  The South African nation in July passed the Virtual Assets Act into law, which requires a regulator to oversee the crypto sector, and includes licensing requirements for service providers like exchanges. But Namibia has a long way to go to catch up with countries around the world – including its neighbor South Africa – in setting up comprehensive laws and rules for the sector.  The act is exciting and timely but only a “skeleton” of what the crypto space needs, Ronald Nanub, economist at the Office of the Prime Minister in Namibia, said in an interview with CoinDesk.  For one, the act requires a regulator to oversee the sector, but a watchdog has yet to be chosen. Although the regime is trying to bring virtual asset providers “to the same standards that you would have on exchange controls and financial institutions,” the lack of clarity on how a chosen regulator might treat crypto could stop companies from setting up in Namibia, said Diana Vivo, associate at law firm DLA Piper Africa (ESI) Namibia.  Doing a 180  The Virtual Assets Act is a dramatic turnaround from the Namibian central bank’s previous stance that crypto exchanges were illegal in the country. The bank said in 2017 that there were no legal provisions for exchanges to operate.  The new law changes that as it subjects crypto firms to the Financial Intelligence Act’s anti-financial crime provisions and the Companies Act. Firms must be incorporated in Namibia and have a registered office in the country in order to get a license. If a crypto firm operates in the country without a license, it could face up to 10 years of imprisonment or pay a penalty of 10,000,000 Namibian dollars ($671,572).  The new law also sets requirements for consumer protection, preventing market abuse and money laundering. But the act is only the first step to setting up a comprehensive regulatory strategy, according to Nanub.  Next steps  Namibia needs a crypto tax framework that is “fit for purpose,” according to Nanub, because the country doesn’t tax digital assets, even for capital gains. Another commission or compliance body could also be created to ensure people follow rules, he added.  Under the new law, the chosen crypto regulator will have powers to license virtual asset service providers and make new rules. However, the bill “doesn't give obligations to the regulatory authority, the structure, the level of expertise that it needs to have, it's still very open,” Vivo said, explaining some areas that could be addressed in future legislative efforts.  Flexibility is good but “we do not want to see those powers being taken beyond proper limits,” Jamie Theron, senior associate of DLA Piper Africa (ESI) Namibia said.  A regulatory framework on how banks should treat fintech and a central bank position paper on crypto regulation – which states merchants should be allowed to accept crypto as payment if they wish – hint at how the country may go on to regulate the sector.  The new law will come into effect on a date determined by Namibia’s finance minister, Vivo said.

15590374,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545618,1691056850,"Here’s Where The Price Of LUNC Will Land This August, According  To This Algorithm","LUNC’s community has worked continually towards reviving the ecosystem’s native LUNC token. However, recent data from this artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm suggests these efforts might not be enough. LUNC’s Price Prediction PricePredictions, a state-of-the-art crypto analysis and forecasting platform, has projected Terra Classic (LUNC) to trade at around $0.000076 by the end of this month. PricePredictions combines indicators like average true range (ATR), relative strength index (RSI), and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) to make such forecasts. Related Reading: Buying Pressure Incoming? MicroStrategy Files Notice With SEC To Sell $750 Million In Stocks Suppose this projection is anything to go by, it means LUNC will experience a decrease from its current price by August 31, 2023, with LUNC currently trading at around $0.000079, according to data from CoinGeko. While this news is undoubtedly bearish for the LUNC community, there was more to cheer about following Binance removing 1.14 billion tokens from circulation as part of the LUNC burn mechanism. LUNC’s price also surged following this news, although it has since retraced. While the machine-learning prediction indicates a potential decline in LUNC’s price, it is important to note that the recent price spike following the Binance announcement demonstrates that positive developments can potentially reverse the trend of Terra Classic. Such events could potentially mean that we could see more uptrend from the token as the community continues to propose solutions that could see regain the confidence of investors and push its once stablecoin USTC to re-peg with the dollar. Token price sitting at $0.00007937 | Source: LUNCBUSD on Tradingview.com USTC Decision Likely To Affect LUNC Vegas, a member of the LUNC community, had earlier proposed in a tweet that the $800 million USTC tokens linked to the Ozone protocol should be returned to the Terra Classic community pool because of the ineffectiveness of the project and its failure to adhere to the proposed development plan. Meanwhile, there has been a conflicting proposal from Alex Forshaw, a co-author of the Terra Classic Revival Roadmap, who has proposed that the $800 million USTC tokens be burned instead. He believes that validators and stakers who have a strong influence on the ecosystem will most likely dump their tokens, leading to a further decline in the token’s value. Related Reading: Ethereum ETFs Heat Up As Filings With SEC Climbs To Six While whatever proposal the community moves forward with will affect USTC’s price with the hope that it finally reclaims its peg with the US dollar, it will most likely affect LUNC’s price too. Currently, LUNC’s price is trending at $0.00007925, down 1.62% in the last 24 hours and 3.08% in the last 7 days. However, this downtrend could quickly reverse if the community is able to figure out a way to re-peg USTC to the US dollar.

42419802,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFzET,1691056800,Bitget Exchange Faces Lawsuit by Advisor of ReelStar Token Project After the Listing Goes Sour,"Luthra, who has almost 100,000 followers on Twitter, is suing Bitget, an exchange, for freezing his holdings in REELT, a token he was promoting.  Bitget says Luthra may have been selling tokens on the exchange, even as he was selling them as the listing opened.  Like many small-cap tokens promoted by influencers like Luthra, REELT, created by RealStar, a startup, dropped dramatically on opening day.  A little-known token project hires an advisor to build popularity. The advisor gets his fee in tokens and sells some after the exchange listing. The exchange freezes his account. Influencer sues.  This, in a nutshell, is the story of Evan Luthra, a prolific crypto influencer who claims to have advised 40 token projects and invested in 400.  Luthra promoted ReelStar, a startup that raised $5 million in an ICO in 2022 to build a creator-oriented social media app where content producers would be rewarded with crypto. He sold his token on Bitget, a Seychelles-registered crypto exchange, and then the exchange froze his position.  Now Luthra is suing Bitget, saying it unlawfully denied access to his account and also poisoned his relationship with the project, which terminated the advisory contract and denied Luthra the rest of his reward. The first step is setting up a litigation hold, which gives Bitget a chance to respond before the suit is formally filed in the Seychelles.  The story illustrates the thorny path to success for the small-cap tokens, where most early adopters get in for a short-term gain and the price crashes right after the token is listed, leaving buyers with losses.  Luthra started advising ReelStar last October and he was promised 150 million REELT, the project’s “utility token,” in multiple tranches over 20 months, he told CoinDesk.  “Since October, I haven’t got any tokens so it was very fair for me to sell,” he said in an interview, adding that before the listing, he received 7.5 million tokens and 1.3 million of them he sold on Bitget. He was also selling some on two other exchanges, MEXC and Gate, he added, and those two had zero problem with that.  Luthra tried to prove his case to Bitget, but to no avail, and the conflict spilled over to Twitter.  Read more: Anna Baydakova - Want to Mine Bitcoin at Home? DIY Bitcoiners Have Stories to Share  In April, Bitget wrote a blog post saying the influencer [Luthra was not named] acted in bad faith and Bitget will “cooperate with the relevant authorities to investigate if any illegal activity has been carried out, such as insider trading or price manipulation.”  “Except for denying he is the one who dumped on his followers, there are many other misleading statements in the FUDs from this crypto influencer, trying to position himself as a victim, rather than the miscreant,” Bitget wrote.  ReelStar, a social media platform, uses smart contracts to ensure that creators are paid on time and that the revenue is distributed equitably, co-founder Nick (Narinder) Bahl told an online media outlet Entrepreneur in March.  For 1% of the REELT token supply, Luthra agreed to consult the project on marketing and promoting the token via influencers. He was supposed to get rewarded in multiple tranches but only got one. The whole collaboration fell apart immediately after the token got listed on several centralized exchanges. It was delisted from Bitget soon after.  The story is a part of a larger trend when new token projects launch in the red, with large amounts of tokens sold and the price crashes right after listing, leaving holders scrambling for breadcrumbs.  Foiled listing  REELT was listed on Bitget on March 23. In the first couple of hours, according to Bitget, massive sales of the freely distributed token saw its price take a nosedive. On opening day, REELT plunged from $0.12 to $0.02.  Bitget stopped trading in REELT on March 24, explaining that right after the trading went live, four accounts started dumping tokens, including three accounts belonging to the market-maker hired by the project and one controlled by the advisor.  “In a short time, these accounts sold more than 2 million REELT tokens, receiving nearly 400,000 USDT. At the same time, the price of REELT dropped from an opening price of 0.07 USDT to 0.028 USDT — a decrease of over 60%,” Bitget said on March 31, adding that the exchange decided to delist REELT and compensate users who bought the tokens there. Later, Bitget said it refunded 583 users.  Luthra that day sold 1.3 million tokens from his account, he admits. He maintains that he did nothing wrong: according to him, the ReelStar CEO Navdeep Sharma told Luthra he was free to sell his tokens, Luthra said. And he did not even sell everything he had all at once.  The token was also listed on other exchanges, but the project asked the platforms to stop all the trading, citing “significant price discrepancies between the prices quoted on each exchange.”  “A number of bad actors have been using this disparity to manipulate the price of REELT, solely for their own arbitrage benefit,” said a post in the project’s Telegram group which has since been deleted.  The ReelStar team declined to comment on this story, citing ongoing negotiations with Bitget.  Bitget said the unnamed market-maker sold just a bit less than Luthra on that first day of trading and also got its accounts frozen.  Alexey Andryunin, founder and CEO Gotbit, has made a career in inflating trading volume of small altcoins, as CoinDesk has previously reported. He also worked with Luthra to liquidate his token allocation, he told CoinDesk, and was watching the situation in real-time.  Andryunin told CoinDesk that it’s quite common for market-makers to get a loan of tokens from a project to provide liquidity and then to dump those tokens immediately after the listing, sending the price south. That allows such market-makers to buy tokens back at the low price and then return the loan to the token issuer, after making a 80%-90% profit over a year or less.  “It happens in nine of the 10 cases with smaller token projects. This strategy works well and doesn’t kill the project with larger coins, listed on big exchanges, like Solana, NEAR, etc.,” Andryunin said.  “Founders of smaller projects don’t understand that traditional market makers aren’t good for them. They end up selling the control over their market to a third party,” he said.  In the case of ReelStar, the problem might have been that the project released more tokens than the market was ready to swallow at the moment, Andryunin said, adding that it can be the market maker’s mistake or lack of coordination on the side of Reel. Given the 583 users who, according to Bitget, it had to refund, the order book for REELT indeed was pretty shallow when the listing kicked off.  “First, you need to create a market on to which to sell,” Andryunin added.  Advisor’s share  Speaking to CoinDesk over Telegram messages, Bitget’s spokesperson Jing Zhang said that the exchange has been trying to work the situation out with the REELT team, but saw little cooperation so far.  “If the project team could actively work with us to find a solution and rebuild the trust, that could be a win-win for everyone,” Zhang wrote. “Given that they are unwilling to deal with it together with us, we announced a compensation plan for the users affected by the incident, and completed it by May 17.”  As to Luthra, Zhang insisted that his actions were ethically questionable. “Some actions might be legal but not that ethical, like shilling a coin with your influence and then dumping on your followers.”  “The drop in price triggered plenty of complaints in the Bitget and REELT community, and many of them see it as a potential exit scam,” he said.

42419804,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFzGX,1691056200,Shiba Inu Takes Step to Become DeFi Contender With Digital IDs,"Shiba Inu developers will tie digital-identity services to all platform applications in the hopes of strengthening the project's image among users and governments.  Such steps could fuel demand for SHIB tokens as the project is viewed more legitimately by serious investors.  The Shiba Inu ecosystem will tie all the applications built on its platform to a blockchain-based digital identity to strengthen trust among shib users and governments, a representative for the blockchain told CoinDesk on Thursday.  The move is the latest attempt by Shiba Inu to break away from its meme-coin status and become a serious decentralized-finance, or DeFi, contender in a crowded blockchain market.  Dubbed self-sovereign identity, or SSI, the IDs are the digital alter ego of identity documents, like passports and driver’s licenses. In the digital world, SSI is said to give users more control over their personal data and its distribution online.  Shiba Inu developers say they have been working with community projects — such as those using SHIB or planning to build on the upcoming Shibarium blockchain — to ensure SSI deployment is a priority.  The developers say the rising interest in digital identities and data protection in Canada and the European Union could help position Shiba Inu as a tamer project compared with other blockchains.  ""We are laying the groundwork for a new global standard in decentralized digital trust and international identity verification,” pseudonymous Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama said in a message to CoinDesk. “In this way, Shibarium is the herald of a new digital age where faith in systems is restored and enhanced.”  SHIB, which was initially a meme coin, is turning into a serious blockchain contender with the launch of Shibarium. The layer 2 network will use BONE, TREAT, SHIB and LEASH tokens for applications built on the blockchain.  ""Layer 2"" refers to a set of off-chain systems — separate blockchains — built on top of layer 1 networks. They bundle multiple off-chain transactions into a single layer 1 transaction, which helps reduce the data load on layer 1 networks and fees for users.  A test blockchain for Shibarium has processed 27 million transactions from an estimated 16 million wallets as of July, indicating brisk demand for the network. The network is expected to go live later this month.",POSITIVE,SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | SHIB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/03/shiba-inu-take-steps-to-become-defi-contender-will-add-digital-ids-to-ecosystem-projects,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/75d2460d8a92cf98f7dc077a47399e9d29edb91c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The United States Congress had mandated new tax rules for crypto traders, but officials have been slow to implement these rules. Act Against Evaders According to experts, cryptocurrency brokers have ignored at least half of their tax obligations. Now, a group of prominent Democratic senators has joined Bernie Sanders in demanding federal officials initiate a crackdown to fix what analysts believe is a $50 billion tax gap in the budget caused due to wilful crypto tax evaders. The lawmakers have urged the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Treasury to publish tax reporting guidelines for cryptocurrency brokers and enforce the guidelines. Along with Bernie Sanders, Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bob Casey, and Richard Blumenthal have signed a letter warning the heads of the IRS and the Treasury that time was running out to implement the proposed rules. The rules lawmakers were referring to in the letter are the directives that were included in the Senate’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, passed in August 2021. The bill broadened tax reporting requirements for businesses that acted as brokers for cryptocurrencies, Officials Slow To Implement Rules The four lawmakers stated that the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act required new reporting requirements when it came to crypto trading. However, officials in the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have not yet created any rules to implement them, despite a deadline set by Congress looming. Many experts have stated that such a delay in drafting tax regulations of such nature is highly unusual. The lawmakers quoted a report by Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation, which stated that failure to address the tax gap due to crypto brokers evading taxes could cost the Treasury $28 billion over the next eight years. “Nearly two years have passed since the law was enacted, and the implementation deadline is less than six months away—but Treasury has yet to publish proposed rules. If your agencies fail to implement the new crypto tax reporting rules by December 31, 2023 — the deadline established by Congress — you will risk losing an estimated $1.5 billion in tax revenue in 2024. This is an unacceptable outcome.” The lawmakers further argued, “Research suggests that crypto tax evaders are cheating the IRS out of at least $50 billion a year—but the figure may be much higher. Given the chance, tax evaders and the crypto intermediaries willing to aid them will continue to game the system, exploit loopholes, and siphon off billions of dollars a year from the U.S. government. You must not give them that chance.” A Significant Gap Analysts from Barclays had claimed the $50 billion figure quoted by the lawmakers last year, based on IRS data from 2017. However, they say that the actual figure could be much higher given the jump in activity in the crypto space in recent years. According to analysts, the $50 billion gap accounts for 10% of the national tax gap, which is the money owed in taxes every year but not paid. Furthermore, because of the anonymous nature of crypto exchanges, the Internal Revenue Service faces a daunting task in figuring out where the taxes are not being paid. Officials have repeatedly pointed out that the longer it takes to implement rules, the more large crypto traders can avoid paying taxes. New Rules Could Tackle Offenders If passed, the new rules implemented by the Treasury Department will require entities such as Coinbase to furnish information about crypto trades. This information would include gains and losses, which would be reported to the IRS. Many experts are of the view that the new rules would give the IRS the much-needed tools to ensure the closure of the tax gap. It would also give the IRS the resources it needs to go after large-scale tax evaders. The rules have received support from President Joe Biden, who has stated on numerous occasions that crypto loopholes are allowing wealthy crypto investors to hide their revenue from authorities. The new rules will also help the industry, which is already grappling with numerous types of fraud and corruption. The lawmakers in question have been highly critical of the crypto space, with Warren being extremely outspoken about the FTX debacle. Warren had also asked Fidelity to shelve its 401(k) Bitcoin plan and alleged that the illegal fentanyl drug trade was being funded using crypto.

15588107,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545595,1691051441,DOJ Action Against Binance: A Hidden Blessing For Bitcoin And Crypto Markets?,"The looming prospect of a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) action against Binance, the largest crypto exchange, may hold a silver lining for Bitcoin and the broader markets. Even if this sounds crazy at first, there are good arguments for it. Rumors have been swirling for weeks about a potential DOJ action against Binance, a threat that has cast a long shadow over the markets, leading to increased volatility and uncertainty among investors. Yesterday’s report by Semafor has rekindled the rumor, but also gave it a new perspective, hinting that these developments may be a blessing in disguise for Bitcoin and crypto markets. According to the Semafor report, the DOJ is contemplating fraud charges against Binance but is also weighing the potential repercussions to consumers and the crypto market at large. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the report suggests that federal prosecutors are concerned that an indictment could trigger a “bank run” similar to the calamitous fate that befell the now-bankrupt FTX platform. Related Reading: Binance To Enter Japan With A Bang, Will List More Tokens Than Any Local Exchange This fear arises from the concern that a potential indictment could lead to a rapid withdrawal of funds, causing consumers to lose their money and potentially trigger a wider panic in the Bitcoin and crypto markets. To circumvent such a catastrophe, the prosecutors are exploring other options like levying fines or establishing deferred or non-prosecution agreements. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin And Crypto Markets? Interestingly, some crypto market analysts and commentators view this ongoing saga as a potential boon. Macro analyst Alex Kruger, in a recent Twitter post, speculated, “Too Big to Jail? Call me crazy but this seems bullish if true.” This statement captures the sentiment that if Binance is considered too important to be hit with crippling charges, the DOJ could explore less harmful alternatives. A similar view is held by renowned analyst Pentoshi, who said, “It doesn’t mean they won’t drop the hammer either. I think calling it “bullish” is a bit extreme since they are considering dropping the hammer. And if not billions in fines and CZ likely gone. But I def don’t think it’d as bearish as headlines first said at all. Bullish would be no DoJ involvement.” Related Reading: Binance Coin (BNB) Price Gears Up For A 10% Upswing – Here’s How The prospect of the DOJ acting against Binance could also provide a much-needed clarity to the market. If Binance were indeed vulnerable to a bank run, it would quickly become apparent whether the exchange holds sufficient reserves. However, so far, Binance has impressively weathered previous “stress tests”, as highlighted by CEO “CZ” in a Twitter post in mid-December last year after the Mazars audit rumors, stating, “We saw some withdrawals today (net $1.14b ish). We have seen this before. Some days we have net withdrawals; some days we have net deposits. Business as usual for us.” This sentiment is echoed by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young-Ju who shared data supporting the strength of Binance’s user balances despite constant rumors of insolvency. He stated: I’ve heard about the ‘bank run/insolvency risk on Binance’ a hundred times for years, but their user balances always tell a different story. At press time, the BNB price stood at $239.5.

When FTX filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. last November, it started Chapter 11 cases for 102 associated entities from around the world. FTX Dubai, which was set up in February 2022 and which is owned by the company's European arm, was one of the entities roped into the proceedings.  But FTX Dubai didn't conduct any business prior to the bankruptcy filing in the United Arab Emirates and therefore ""has no reasonable likelihood of rehabilitating its operations,"" the bankrupt estate argued in the filing requesting the dismissal of the unit.  ""Additionally, FTX Dubai is balance sheet solvent. Therefore, the debtors believe that a solvent voluntary liquidation procedure in accordance with the laws of the United Arab Emirates would allow a timely distribution of the positive cash balance after payment of all outstanding liabilities and liquidation of all assets,"" the filing said.  The estate argues that any court orders while FTX Dubai was part of the proceedings should stand, but that the dismissal requested ""is necessary"" to protect the debtors and authorize them to, for instance, pay pre-bankruptcy wages and salaries, along with other compensation, benefits and expenses to Dubai employees.

Product Page: https://www.bunzz.dev/decipher This is a powerful tool that strongly supports developers who want to develop new DApps based on existing contracts, traders and investors who want to understand complex DeFi protocols, and business owners of web3 products. This Tool Empowers Web3 Folks with Contract Clarification DeCipher quickly became a hot topic as a powerful tool, supporting developers who want to develop new DApps based on existing contracts, traders and investors seeking to understand complex DeFi protocols, and business owners of Web3 products. This is not surprising because DeCipher supports almost all blockchains, enabling the generation of ""user-friendly manuals"" for nearly all deployed contracts. This new technology makes DApp cloning and research much more accessible, clearly promoting the mass adoption of Web3. Furthermore, the vulnerability of many assets due to weaknesses in the Vyper language has raised concerns. However, DeCipher's ability to learn vulnerability patterns in contracts, not limited to Vyper language, suggests the potential for an LLM-based auditing tool to be realized. DeCipher's unique data processing algorithm DeCipher leverages advanced AI models, ChatGPT3.5 and 4, specifically optimized for analyzing Smart Contracts.

In a Bloomberg interview on Wednesday Michael Saylor said that Microstrategy will continue to buy bitcoin on behalf of its shareholders. “Our goal is to accumulate as much bitcoin as we can on behalf of our shareholders, and we acquired from cash flows, we bought that last tranche for $48.4 million dollars of company cash.” He went on to say that Microstrategy would buy as much bitcoin as it possibly could as long as market conditions allowed it. Commenting on the fact that Microstrategy shares were up more than 200% Saylor said that potential share sales would just be used to buy even more bitcoin. The Microstrategy plan, according to Saylor, is to use all the resources the company has in order to keep on acquiring bitcoin going forward. He remarked that at the same time that bitcoin was up 145%, since three years ago when his company began its strategy, shares in his company had risen 254%. He said: “Our strategy is levered long, offer a yield, don’t charge a fee, and then actively manage our position and actively manage acquisitions and financings between equity, debt, and cash flows in order to get the best result for our shareholders.” On the potential of spot Bitcoin ETFs becoming available, Saylor was really bullish, saying that this would enable large hedge funds and sovereigns to enter the space with many $billions of capital. On the difference between investing in Microstrategy and a spot ETF, Saylor remarked: “We don’t have a capital structure that would allow for tens of billions of dollars to be invested in bitcoin, so we are a unique instrument, we’re that sports car, and the spot ETF has gotta be like the supertanker.” On the fact that Microstrategy has rallied so much more than bitcoin so far this year Saylor explained: “Bitcoin is the house everybody wants, but it’s in a foreign country and you have to pay cash to buy it. It takes about a year and you can’t rent it or mortgage it. Microstrategy is that same house in the best neighbourhood with 10,000 acres of ranch land attached to it, and we can generate a yield and you can actually buy it financed by your local bank right? We’re a compliant security. So if you’re an institutional investor and you’re looking for an easy way to get bitcoin exposure that doesn’t charge you a fee, that is financeable, that is good collateral, then Microstrategy is pretty compelling right now.

Here's Why,"Slippage – the difference between the price a trader expects to pay and the price they actually pay – can be used to identify changes in market trends.  Data tracked by Hyblock Capital shows spikes in slippage in the ether market frequently mark price peaks and troughs.  Traders use several technical and fundamental indicators to navigate the speedy and risky crypto market.  They can consider adding one more to the list: A gauge of ""slippage"" in the ether market. The indicator has consistently identified trend changes in the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency this year.  Slippage is the difference between the price at which a trading order is executed and the price at which it was requested. It occurs in fast-moving, highly volatile market conditions or when liquidity is low.  In both cases, the price moves faster than the time it takes for the order to fill either because of the volatility or the lack of supply, and can work in favor of or against traders. For instance, if a purchase order is executed at a price higher than the quoted price, it's the case of high (or unfavorable) slippage.  A spike in slippage in the ether market has historically presaged trend changes, data provided by Crypto research firm Hyblock Capital show.  The chart shows ether's USDT-denominated price and aggregated maximum slippage – the highest daily slippage on a single market order. The aggregated max slippage includes data from crypto exchanges Binance, BitMEX, Bybit, Bitfinex, Deribit, Huobi, OKX, Phemex, and quarterly futures listed on Huobi and OKX.  Ether's late 2021 bull market peak and the December 2022 bear market bottom coincided with a sudden and notable increase in slippage.

Emerging onto the scene precisely when the blockchain realm was searching for an Ethereum (ETH) alternative, Kaspa’s protocol arrived as a timely solution. This came after Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake (PoS) framework the previous year. A DAG-based PoW is a variation of the traditional proof-of-work consensus mechanism used in blockchain systems. In a typical blockchain PoW system, miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles in order to add new blocks to the blockchain. This process requires significant computational power and energy consumption. Related Reading: Curve DAO (CRV) Price Recovery Post-Exploit: What Would Be A Realistic Scenario?

Insights into this crowdfund achievement, provided through an update via reliable sources, promise to be unveiled shortly. The anticipation surrounding these forthcoming details suggests a direct correlation between this significant milestone and the recent surge in KAS’s valuation.

The Department of Justice has concerns about potential market instability and consumer fallout of such action. DOJ Sets Its Sights On Binance According to the report, while officials are mulling action, they are also concerned about the drastic domino effect it could have on the larger crypto market, leading to considerable market instability. According to sources familiar with the matter, Department of Justice officials are concerned that action against Binance could trigger a bank run similar to the one seen with bankrupt exchange FTX. The bank run in the wake of the FTX situation caused thousands of customers to lose their funds, triggering panic in the crypto markets. Reacting to the news, the crypto markets came under some selling pressure, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) witnessing drops. BNB also saw a drop of over 3% following the reports but has since recovered, rising by 2%. A Compromise? Given the concerns surrounding action against Binance, the Department of Justice is contemplating compromise options such as non-deferred prosecution agreements and large fines. According to sources, such action would minimize harm to consumers while still holding the exchange accountable for its actions. Reports of the Department of Justice contemplating action against Binance gathered steam after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued the cryptocurrency exchange and its billionaire founder Changpeng Zhao. The Securities and Exchange Commission brought 13 charges against the exchange, which included operating as an unregulated securities exchange in the United States and commingling investor funds. It has also charged Binance with misleading customers by using a secret market-making firm called Sigma Chain and manipulating trades on Binance’s US platform. Additionally, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has also brought similar charges against the exchange. A Potential Black Swan According to the Q1 2023 crypto industry report, FTX held a 5% market share of the spot crypto trading volumes across the top ten crypto exchanges. The exchange’s collapse decimated the crypto markets, with Bitcoin dropping by almost 25% in 2 days. Data from the Block has revealed that in July 2023, Binance held a market share of 47% in spot crypto trading activity. Given that Binance holds a far more dominant position than FTX did, the ramifications for the market in the event of Binance meeting the same fate as FTX would be catastrophic. FTX collapsed largely due to a bank run due to fears about its balance sheet’s strength, which were well-founded in the end as FTX eventually had to halt withdrawals. This is because the exchange did not have enough assets to process withdrawal requests. But is the concern surrounding Binance legitimate? Binance has stated on a number of occasions that it is possible to verify that the exchange holds its user assets in a 1:1 ratio apart from its reserves. According to its website, the exchange claims that the ratio of bits Bitcoin holdings with respect to customer net balances stands at around 104%. This means that as things stand, even if the Department of Justice brought fraud charges against Binance, the exchange would be able to fulfill all withdrawal requests without any issues. Despite the developments, Changpeng Zhao remained defiant, highlighting the fact that Binance Coin (BNB) was the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

In the past few months, Australia has cracked down against crypto firms, including Binance Australia, whose offices were searched by ASIC. Major banks in Australia have imposed partial restrictions on crypto citing ""scams and the amount of money lost by customers.""  Around the time of FTX's collapse, ASIC has sued fintech company Block Earner, and BPS Financial, the company behind the qoin digital token, for running misleading ads.  ASIC alleges that eToro's target market was far too broad and its screening test was very difficult to fail and almost 20,000 of eToro's clients lost money trading CFDs between Oct. 2021 and June 2023.  ""For example, if a retail client had a medium-risk tolerance but was not an experienced investor and had no understanding of the risks of trading CFDs, that client still fell within the target market,"" the ASIC said. ""...clients could amend their answers without limitation and clients were prompted if they selected answers which could result in them failing.  ""eToro AUS is considering the allegations filed by ASIC in these proceedings and will respond accordingly. There is no impact or disruption of service for clients of eToro AUS and no material impact on eToro’s global business,"" the company said in a statement, adding that it is now operating with a revised target market determination in place for CFDs.

15579709,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545575,1691031616,"Key On-Chain Metric Points to Stagnation, Will Ethereum Ever Break $2,000?","According to Etherscan data, the number of active ERC-20 addresses has not changed much in 2023. It has stayed between 200,000 and 300,000 while Ethereum prices stagnate below July 2023 highs. As of August 2, there were about 275,000 active ERC-20 addresses, up from 156,000 on June 18. Although activity has been low overall, there was a significant increase on June 11, with over 446,000 active ERC-20 addresses. Ethereum’s price trajectory has been tumultuous in tandem with this activity pattern, looking at the charts. For instance, Ethereum bulls have failed to breach the $2,100 liquidation level posted in the latter stages of H1 2023. Ethereum Prices Volatile, Few Coins Burned At the moment, ETH prices hover around the $1,800 range, teetering precariously and likely to drop, looking at candlestick arrangements in the daily chart. Although Ethereum has been bullish in the past two months, bulls have been tamed, and a drop below the $1,800 level may signal a shift from bullish to bearish in the medium term. With ETH under pressure, the number of active ERC-20 addresses remains constant and relatively lower than the 2021 peaks. This means there is less demand for ETH, which is used to pay transaction fees. As a result, gas fees are lower because there is less competition for block space. Typically, this would encourage more people to participate and even deploy complex contracts in decentralized finance (DeFi). Related Reading: Ethereum ETFs Heat Up As Filings With SEC Climbs To Six With EIP-1559 in the equation, low activity means fewer coins are taken out of circulation. Despite low network activity, the protocol continues to issue 2 ETH after each validated block, watering down deflationary effects enforced by EIP-1559. DeFi Activities Falling Falling activity could be attributed to the waning interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities over recent months. As of August 2, the total value locked (TVL) remains below $50 billion, with a significant portion of assets tied in Ethereum. DeFi projects like LidoDAO, Curve, and Uniswap facilitate the trading of ERC-20 tokens. Furthermore, on-chain data highlights USDT as the most actively transacted token. Given its position as the third-largest coin by market cap, with substantial circulation in Ethereum and Tron networks, such a trend is expected. Looking back at ERC-20 transactions from June and July, it is evident that transfers stayed constant despite temporary price increases. Ethereum prices rose from $1,630 to $2,000 between mid-June and mid-July 2023, but ETH is now lower. Related Reading: BNB Nears $250 Level As Market Suffers Volatility; What’s Driving It? On-chain ERC-20 activity has remained stable despite price volatility. It’s unclear whether there will be a change in activity as prices continue to drop.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading just below $29,223, off 2% over the past 24 hours.

Ether, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization was recently changing hands at $1,843, off 1.3%. Other major cryptos, which spent much of Wednesday in the red, moved more deeply into negative territory. And litecoin (LTC) recently plunged more than 5%, despite the token's anticipated halving event, which cut miners rewards in half, curbing the issuance of new tokens. Decentralized exchange Uniswap's UNI token was off more than 7.5%, while SOL and ADA, the native cryptos of the smart contracts platforms Solana and Cardano, were each down more than 2.5%.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a measure of crypto markets performance, was recently down 0.5%.  The Nikkei and Hang Seng indexes were off nearly a percentage point and 0.4%, respectively, following a down day for U.S. stocks, which struggled with a Fitch decision to downgrade the country's credit rating.

Tawil said that demand for the software developer's shares remained strong among investors seeking exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  ""Does MicroStrategy as it currently exists, as it seems to be going, have a finite shelf life in light of the developments in the sector?"" Tawil asked rhetorically. ""We've got a lot clamoring. MicroStrategy still fills a need in the marketplace.""  Tawil's comments came a day after MicroStrategy said it will sell $750 million in stock with the intent of adding to its bitcoin stash of 152,300 BTC worth over $4.5 billion. Much of its holdings have come since the pandemic and followed a strategy shift by its now Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, a bitcoin bull. Saylor has faced criticism that MicroStrategy's performance depends too deeply on an asset that has been famously volatile through much of its history.  MicroStrategy's shares sank under $165 late last year at the height of the bear crypto market, a nearly 80% drop over the 12-month period when bitcoin's price sank from over $67,000 to about $16,500. The stock was recently trading over $400, its rise dovetailing with bitcoin's improved performance  Tawil noted that MicroStrategy stock is easier to trade than the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which offers another way to invest in a bitcoin-targeted product without purchasing the asset itself.  ""The most significant point out of yesterday's earnings call is the fact that they may go out and raise an additional three-quarters of a billion dollars to buy more bitcoin,"" Tawil said. ""As long as we've got this disjointed system of how exactly people can invest in bitcoin, there seems to be room in the universe for one MicroStrategy.""  Important events.

Data from IntoTheBlock reveals that the crypto’s whales – entities holding large quantities – have shifted billions of SHIB tokens in the past 24 hours. This vast movement of funds coincides with an increase in Shiba Inu’s large transaction volume, reaching roughly 1.13 trillion SHIB. It appears that large-scale investors are making their moves in anticipation of the cryptocurrency’s next big announcement, which is likely to be the Shibarium launch. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Is Shibarium The Key To A Trend Reversal? Whales And Burn Rates – Shiba Inu Active Market The metric of large transaction volumes serves as a key indicator, offering a snapshot of the activities carried out by prominent players, often called ‘whales,’ within the crypto ecosystem during a specific timeframe. This measure mainly provides valuable insights into the magnitude of transactions made by these influential participants on any given day, reflecting their potential impact on the market dynamics. IntoTheBlock defines large transactions as transfers exceeding $100,000. And as it stands, the recent activity shows increasing movements on the Shiba Inu market, with whales adjusting their holdings. Simultaneously, there has been a significant uptick in the burning of SHIB tokens, doubling in the past 24 hours. According to data from Shibburn, a platform solely for tracking Shiba Inu burn activities, over 62 million SHIB tokens have been eliminated from circulation in the past day, increasing the total SHIB burn rate by 220% over the same period. Notably, this deliberate reduction of available tokens is a strategy often used in the crypto sphere to create scarcity and potentially drive up the value of the remaining tokens in the long, in this case, the price of SHIB. The Shibarium Anticipation The recent activity among SHIB’s largest holders may be connected to the upcoming Shibarium launch. Bitcoin advocate Davinci Jeremie has recently expressed his bullish sentiment on X (formerly known as Twitter), stating, “Big things are happening for Shib looking forward to [seeing] what happens.” Related Reading: Shibarium Hype: Shiba Inu Whales Boost Appetite, Snag 1 Trillion SHIB Tokens Further fuelling the anticipation, the official SHIB account on X also hinted at the community with a post featuring a cheerful expression of a Shiba Inu dog. However, the specifics of what these “big things” could be remain uncertain, further stoking the fires of curiosity and excitement among the Shiba Inu investors. GM #SHIBARMY pic.twitter.com/bC60SaRx4L — Shib (@Shibtoken) August 2, 2023 However, as the curtain rises on the next chapter for Shiba Inu, the recent flurry of whale activity and the increased burn rate underline a market bracing for impact. Whether the coming changes propel SHIB to new heights or steer it down another path is a story that remains to be written. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu token SHIB has seen quite a retrace in the past 24 hours following a more than 5% increase over the past 7 days. At the time of writing, SHIB trades for $0.00000817 down by 1.1% in the past 24 hours.

15576717,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545562,1691024442,"Litecoin Completes Halving, But Price Plunges 6%","Litecoin has completed its much-anticipated halving event today, but it seems the investors have reacted by participating in a selloff. Litecoin Has Completed Its Third Halving, Block Rewards Now Down To 6.25 LTC The “halving” event is where LTC’s block rewards are permanently cut in half. This event is periodic, occurring approximately every four years or roughly every 840,000 blocks miners hash. Today’s halving was Litecoin’s third, meaning its block rewards have been cut three times since its genesis. In the first halving, the cryptocurrency saw its block rewards go from an initial 50 LTC to 25 LTC, and with the second, the tips dropped further to 12.5 LTC. With the latest halving event, miners’ rewards for solving blocks have been cut down further to 6.25 LTC. The reason that halvings even exist is because they serve as a measure for controlling the asset’s inflation. These block rewards that miners receive are the only way to introduce fresh tokens into the circulating supply, so cutting them down repeatedly makes sure that the cryptocurrency’s supply goes up slower and slower. Eventually, when the halvings would keep on happening, the block rewards would approach zero. This would occur approximately in 2142. After this point, the asset’s supply will hit the maximum cap, and the miners will have to rely on transaction fees to pay off their running costs. As halvings are important events, it’s natural that there has been a lot of discussion around this latest event as it has approached. During the start of July, the asset had observed a sharp rally towards the $114 mark, as the market had perhaps become hopeful for the halving, which was only one month away. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates Most Positive Since Feb, Long Squeeze Soon? This rally, however, ran out of steam soon enough, and since then, LTC has struggled to put together any significant bullish momentum. LTC has plunged during the past day | Source: LTCUSD on TradingView Today’s halving hasn’t been able to change anything in this matter, either, as Litecoin has only plummeted further instead. It would appear that the event has indeed been a buy the rumor, sell the news type of scenario. Following the latest plummet, Litecoin has gone below the $87 level and is down almost 7% during the past 24 hours. These high losses mean that LTC has been the poorest-performing coin out of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap in this period. Related Reading: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Is The Best Thing To Happen To Bitcoin, Mike Novogratz Says While the price performance of the asset might have been poor, LTC supporters may take solace in the fact that the asset has come forward a lot in terms of other network-related metrics since the previous halving, as data from IntoTheBlock shows: The growth of the LTC network | Source: IntoTheBlock on X Interestingly, the price at which both halvings happened was approximately the same. The cryptocurrency seems to have done well in terms of userbase and utility-related growth. This impressive rise in adoption may be because Litecoin offers cheap and fast transactions compared to some other networks like Bitcoin. LTC investors can only hope, however, that this growth may also show up in the price.

15575188,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545558,1691020820,Why Isn’t Bitcoin Outperforming Most Risk Assets? A Market Conundrum,"Mike McGlone, Senior Commodity Strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, has recently suggested that Bitcoin’s (BTC) underperformance compared to the stock market may be a warning sign for investors. BTC’s Failure To Outshine In A Bull Market McGlone notes that Bitcoin has declined compared to the Nasdaq 100 stock index since its 2021 peak and April bounce. This waning performance may presage rising headwinds not only for Bitcoin but also for the broader crypto market. McGlone stated: If Bitcoin truly is the “fastest-horse-in-the-race,” as some consider it to be, then it should logically be outperforming in an everything bull market. However, that is not the case. Notably, McGlone points to the most aggressive liquidity pull from central banks in history, which may be a significant factor in Bitcoin’s underperformance. Related Reading: Buying Pressure Incoming? MicroStrategy Files Notice With SEC To Sell $750 Million In Stocks The Federal Reserve (Fed) is still sighting in 3Q, despite the producer price index finished-goods gauge at minus 3.1% and dropping from 2022’s 18.3% peak at its fastest pace since 1948, which may be part of what underperforming Bitcoin is “sniffing out,” according to McGlone. On a one-year basis to August 1st, Bitcoin is up just over 20%, similar to the Nasdaq, yet the crypto’s volatility is about two times greater. McGlone believes Bitcoin’s underperformance may be a warning sign for the broader market. The fact that Bitcoin is not outperforming as it should be in an everything-bull market could indicate that more significant market issues are at play, particularly in the face of aggressive liquidity pulls from central banks. Bitcoin And Ethereum Volatility At Historic Lows In a statement shared with NewsBTC Luuk Strijers, the Chief Commercial Officer at Deribit, a prominent cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, has recently stated that the Deribit Volatility Index (DVOL) for both Bitcoin and Ethereum is currently trading at an all-time low. This is a significant development, especially since the DVOL for ETH is trading below the DVOL for BTC, which is a rare occurrence and may have been caused by the activity of a single large trader, commonly known as a whale. Despite the current low levels of volatility, Luuk Strijers highlights that the market is anticipating a considerable upswing in volatility shortly. This expectation is driven by several factors, including the upcoming ruling on the Blackrock spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) and the approaching Bitcoin Halving. Strijers notes that Deribit has been observing signs of these expectations in the market, such as the significant steepness of the term structure, with June ’24 trades at approximately 50, and the enduring call skew. These indicators suggest that the market is anticipating increased volatility and potential price movements shortly, despite the current low levels of volatility. The Blackrock spot ETF ruling is anticipated to impact the cryptocurrency market significantly. If approved, the ETF will allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency, potentially increasing demand and driving up prices. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Is Shibarium The Key To A Trend Reversal? On the other hand, if the ruling is not approved, it may lead to a temporary drop in prices and increased volatility. The approaching Bitcoin Halvening, which is expected to occur in 2024, is another factor contributing to the anticipation of increased volatility, according to Strijers. The Halvening is a significant event in the Bitcoin network that occurs roughly every four years, where the block reward for Bitcoin miners is cut in half. This tends to reduce the supply of Bitcoin on the market, potentially driving up prices and increasing volatility. Despite the current low levels of volatility, Strijers suggests that investors and traders should remain vigilant and prepare for potential price movements and increased volatility in the cryptocurrency market. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $29,100, representing a slight increase of 0.8% in the past 24 hours.
