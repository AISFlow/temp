4053982,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=510278,1668123112,Crypto Market Loses $200 Billion As Bitcoin Plunges,"Some days back, the crypto market was celebrating a significant rally in the price of major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin hit a remarkable recovery surpassing the $20K level to $21,500. However, the story quickly changed as the FTT crash dragged the other tokens down. Due to the ongoing FTX crisis in the crypto space, many assets have recorded new all-time lows. Latest reports show that BTC has hit a two-year low, plummeting to $15,500 and leaving the market with a $200 billion loss. It all began with a clash of interest between Binance and FTX, which drove the former’s decision to liquidate its FTT holdings irregularities. Not long after the feud, FTX liquidated its ETH holdings amid rumors of insolvency issues. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes $18K Following Good US Inflation Report Bitcoin Plummets To A Two-Year Low The cascade effect landed on Bitcoin. Within hours after the celebration, the multi-week high above $21,500, Bitcoin crash-landed to $17,000. As the crisis continued, Bitcoin recorded another decline on Bitstamp yesterday. Finally, bitcoin slumped to $15,500, an all-time low since November 2020. Although BTC has recovered over $1000 since the last slump, its valuation – 6.81% down – is still below the psychological level. Nevertheless, it maintains a market cap above $317 billion and 38.4% dominance. Bitcoin is not the only receiver of the hard blow in the market recently; other cryptocurrencies got even more. For example, Ethereum dropped from $1,600 to nearly $1,100 but recovered slightly above $1,300. Binance Coin (BNB) also went down the drain, dropping by 8.87% after a short rally to $400 with news of the FTX acquisition. BNB further pushed down with reports that Binance would no longer move forward with the FTX acquisition. Solana, which went down to $9 yesterday, now trades at $14 with a 17% decline. Given the news of the upcoming event to Unlock SOL tokens, Solana may meet more volatility today. The total crypto market has lost about $200 billion since the FTX/Binance feud began. FTX Token Tumbles Further As Binance Withdrew Plans of Acquisition Meanwhile, FTT’s situation is terrible. The token has incurred an additional 42% loss in value and now trades at $2.76. Given the circumstances surrounding FTX’s situation, including the alleged investigations against the firm, Binance has pulled out of its plans to acquire the exchange. In the announcement, Binance noted that it hoped to assist FTX in providing liquidity to settle its customers. However, it cannot overlook the fact that FTX misused customers’ funds. Binance condemned FTX’s bad business practices, saying that such actors must be removed from the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Now At Similar Levels To COVID Crash And 2018 Bottom The crypto exchange also said a regulatory framework and decentralization transition would strengthen the crypto industry. Binance’s comments are in line with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s opinions, which he aired on Tuesday. Armstrong believes that a clear regulatory framework and adoption of decentralized exchanges will prevent problems such as the FTX crisis.

4053150,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=510267,1668121428,Maker (MKR) Records 13% Gains Undeterred By Market Downtrends,"MKR, the native token of the Maker Protocol, has recorded substantial gains despite the most recent market downturn. After news of FTX’s liquidity crisis rocked the crypto market, several coins have struggled to bag daily gains to no avail. However, MakerDAO’s governance token has experienced an impressive surge today. Specifically, MKR trades at $873 press time, gaining over 26% on the day. Despite the huge jump in the day, Maker still hasn’t recovered its weekly losses. However, if its bullish trend continues, it might fully recover in a short time. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes $18K Following Good US Inflation Report MKR Surges As Bullish Momentum Kicks In After a steep drop and sell-off over the last day, bulls have succeeded in turning around the Maker’s (MKR) negative trend. MKR’s price increased by $177.40, or 13.64 percent, to $840 during this recovery. The main catalyst for the price surge is an increase in 1-day trading activities and market cap. Specifically, MKR saw a 27.26% increase in its market capitalization and a 15.37% surge in trading volume. MKR’s gains were most felt in the DeFi sector of the Maker Protocol. According to a Token Terminal Intern on Twitter, the DeFi sector lost around 20% of its total value locked in the last 24 hours. This is unsurprising and expected due to FTX’s controversy. However, despite the downturn, Maker recorded an increase in its TVL. Precisely, Maker saw a TVL increase of 28% over the same period. This increase results from the recent surge in borrowing activities on the platform. As per the thread, Token Terminal Intern noted that the top-three lending protocols, including Maker, facilitated $27B worth of trading volume. The account mentioned that the increase resulted from traders fleeing centralized exchanges due to the FTX collapse. What The Charts Say About MKR’s Movement The intersection of the upper and lower Bollinger Bands is located at 780 and 615, respectively. The widening of the bands indicates a rise in trading activity, which may lead to a price breakthrough. Since the market has broken out above the upper range, bulls appear to be in control, and this upward trend might continue for a while. The RSI is currently at 57.45, which has been quite constant over the past few hours. As a result, the MKR market shows signs of balance between buyers and sellers, suggesting the positive trend will continue. The MACD line is still negative at -8. However, it has crossed over the signal line and is trending upward into positive territory. The histogram is trending upwards, supporting the current bullish pattern. As the MACD line rises above the EMA line, we may be certain that the MKR market will continue to rise. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Now At Similar Levels To COVID Crash And 2018 Bottom Moving averages for 5 and 20 days are 749 and 698, respectively. This uptrend is further backed by the rise of market prices above both moving averages. The Coppock curve, which has just climbed from the negative zone to a value of 8, also implies sustained growth in the MKR market. Overall, the market is expected to stay positive, and major technical signs point to more gains coming up soon.

On Thursday they had cause for optimism when an unexpectedly positive Consumer Price Index report indicated the U.S. Federal Reserve’s recent diet of hawkish, 75 basis point interest rate hikes were working towards reducing a year-long bout of high inflation.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Bitcoin was recently trading near $18,000, a more than 13% increase over the past 24 hours that made its Wednesday plunge below $16,000 – to a level not seen since late 2020 – seem antiquated.  Ether was recently changing hands over $1,300, up almost 17% from Wednesday, same time. All other cryptos in the top 20 by market capitalization were feeling more like themselves again, rising well into the double digits as FTX and inflation fatigue waned – at least temporarily. Even FTX’s beleaguered FTT token, whose accumulation by the exchange’s sister company Alameda Research ignited the current mess, was up over 50% to $3.40. Solana’s SOL, which also figured prominently on Alameda’s balance sheet, raising investor alarm, jumped more than 40%.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market, rose 12%.

It is now apparent that FTX did not do everything on its books in the right way, and now Sam Bankman-Fried is searching for $8.0 billion to save the pieces. In the past two years or so, the U.S. financial system made lots and lots of money available for people and companies to build little empires that came up short. Now, the crypto-world is paying the price for its highly prosperous days. Digital will survive and become the future, but we are still in the age of transformation, trying to find what really works and what regulation is needed. The digital world is going to survive. Digital is the future of finance. But, digital is going to be regulated. The recent experience with the failure of FTX shows us, as stated in the Financial Times , that the digital world will become fully regulated ""as financial services businesses."" The current experience is going to accelerate the move to greater regulation. Currently, the digital world is going through ""the weeding out"" stage of what works and what doesn't work in a space that has become remarkably changed. The transformation the world is moving through is breathtaking. But, a world that is transforming itself can be a painful process. Lots of people have lost lots of money. But, as Andy Kessler exclaims in The Wall Street Journal, ""Bubbles collapse when no one else buys in."" The problem right now, is, as Mr. Kessler states, the crypto market ""is backed by nothing but air."" But, the technology behind the crypto market, behind the digital market, is incredible and will find a place in the financial world. After all, finance is nothing but information, and modern information technology is providing the world with the tools to grow and spread information. Originally, cryptocurrencies were praised as the new ""medium of exchange"" for the world. Cryptocurrencies were to provide the payment system for the future. The fact that cryptocurrencies would also be a ""store of value"" was important, but was not originally at the top of the list of characteristics that would cement the role of cryptocurrencies in the world. Serving as a medium of exchange would guarantee the role of cryptocurrencies in the world. There was a real purpose for these cryptocurrencies, cementing their value to the world. Whoops! Something got out-of-line. The medium of exchange ability of the cryptocurrencies was not secured when the asset was introduced to the world. As a consequence, cryptocurrencies had to justify their existence by being just a store of value. Hence, as Mr. Kessler states, cryptocurrencies ""were backed by nothing but air."" Cryptocurrencies had to justify their value as a store of value, but it was not readily apparent that the cryptocurrencies really brought something of added value to the world. The Bubble Cryptocurrencies did not catch-on quickly after their introduction. For example, Bitcoin was introduced in 2009. As I showed in a recent post , nothing much happened for the first ten years or so of Bitcoin's existence. Then in 2020, the price of Bitcoin began to rise. The apparent cause of this rise was the massive amount of money that the Federal Reserve System was injecting into the financial system of the United States. These monies were being injected to protect the United States against a financial collapse that might be started by the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent recession that followed. The prices of financial assets rose dramatically during this time, and the rise in these prices took on the form of a financial bubble. The spread of financial resources moved into most sectors of the financial world. Traditional asset managers benefited from the spread of this money, but new areas also benefited from the movement. One highly reported sector that benefited greatly from this spread was the ""blank check"" company, or, the Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPACs) that flourished during the 2021-2022 period. Blank check companies are having problems all over the place now, and deals are just not being cut. Bitcoin made its move, and its price rose to over $67,500 on November 8, 2021. Since then, the path has been downwards. In the past day or so, Bitcoin has been down around $16,000. And, the S&P 500 Index (SP500) reached an all-time high on January 3, 2022 and has since tumbled as the Federal Reserve has tightened up its monetary policy. A lot of sectors prospered during the past two years, but now a lot has changed and many of these same sectors have suffered in the reversal. This is what happens when you have asset bubbles. The Other Side FTX is now ""on the rocks."" It is struggling for its life. Sam Bankman-Fried is said to have apologized for his failure. Mr. Bankman-Fried is also looking for $8.0 billion to plug the hole in his ship and keep it float for the near term. As we read in the Financial Times : ""The nascent crypto industry was already struggling with a price crash triggered by the end of the cheap money era. The humbling of Sam Bankman-Fried ((SBF)) is a further blow."" ""The collapse of FTX has been likened to a bank run: Account holders were rushing to get their crypto assets but were being blocked from doing so."" The next step: regulation, and lots of it. Already, Gary Gensler, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has already accelerated the move. Mr. Gensler was already on the track to greater regulation for the Crypto-world. Now the door has opened wide for him. If he doesn't get most of what he wants now, I would argue that he has really muffed a ""gimme putt."" This is the history of innovation. Eventually, the sector comes to the point where regulation becomes almost required. When the market consequences connected with the innovation become hurtful and much is lost, people step back and let the regulators in the door. In fact, they welcome them to come in. The future is digital, there is no question in my mind about that. The future includes crypto. Information grows and spreads. That is what history tells us. But, getting there can be very painful to many and can be very difficult finding the ""best"" path to the future. It happens.

42420893,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtZT3,1668117654,"Crypto's Sharp Declines in Price, Trading Volatility Could Be Worse","Amid the bitter cold crypto winter, will FTX’s crumbling affect crypto prices in the short term or indefinitely prolong the harsh weather? And how does the movement in crypto prices this week compare with other challenges this market has faced in its brief history?  The first question is difficult to answer. Industry-shaking events earlier this year exacerbated a price plunge already in the making, although bitcoin (BTC) established a safe zone during the summer, with support in the $19,000-$20,000 range.  As the impact of the FTX crypto exchange’s insolvency has sunk in, contagion fears have sent bitcoin’s price plunging to a two-year low, and ether’s dropping to midsummer levels. But crypto has survived other storms, rebounding to new highs within months or years. And price movement remains stubbornly difficult to predict.  Crypto asset management giant Galaxy Digital announced a $77 million exposure to FTX, with $48 million potentially locked in withdrawals. Prominent crypto firms Genesis (like CoinDesk, owned by Digital Currency Group), Wintermute, and Multicoin are also said to have exposure to FTX.  Regulatory scrutiny rises  And now regulators, already alarmed by this year’s failures of crypto heavyweights Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network and Voyager Digital, are weighing in.  For instance, the U.S. Department of Justice, Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have begun probing what caused FTX's insolvency, and whether outright fraud was involved.  In Congress on Thursday, U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who heads the House Financial Services Committee, called for stronger crypto regulation. She said that “now more than ever, it is clear that there are major consequences when cryptocurrency entities operate without robust federal oversight, and protections for customers.”  The term “robust” will likely startle investors, including those within decentralized finance (DeFi), despite the sub-sector’s relative lack of participation in any of the recent turmoil.  Will traditional finance (TradFi) companies, which have shown an increasing interest in crypto, be swept up in the current mess?  Contagion spillover to TradFi, whether real or perceived, will likely further increase scrutiny from regulators.  Volatility defying conventional wisdom  Meanwhile, crypto prices have been volatile, although markets have seen worse in their brief history.  BTC’s Nov. 9 decline was its 10th-largest decrease since 2015, although it's only the second-largest decline for 2022, highlighting how tumultuous the year has been.  Trading volume was the seventh highest over the last seven years on Nov. 9, and fourth highest on Nov. 8.  For ETH, the 17% decline on Nov. 9 was its seventh largest since 2017.  Trading volume on Nov. 8 and Nov. 9 don’t crack the top 50 highest days over the last five years.  At first glance, this is surprising. Percentage declines during one of the most pivotal moments in cryptocurrency history barely cracking the top 10 was unexpected.  A possible explanation is that investors holding BTC and ETH are continuing to ""hodl"" their assets. The percentage of profitable bitcoin and ether addresses has dropped to 50% and 47%, respectively, according to data from Glassnode.  Or the trend could simply highlight the resiliency of certain assets overall. Both BTC and ETH rose sharply on Thursday, following a CPI report that showed inflation in the U.S. is slowing by more than expected.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/10/cryptos-sharp-declines-in-price-trading-volatility-could-be-worse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a446e8adb8568018fd8a2e4e7540faa9741bcfa0-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42389617,6F4ZR09tPAWQmeXaoSbPWm,1668117600,Bankman-Fried’s Cabal of Roommates in the Bahamas Ran His Crypto Empire – and Dated. Other Employees Have Lots of Questions,"""Shocking"" is a word that aptly describes the rapid fall of Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency empire. To a surprising degree, it’s a sentiment that pours out from people who worked for him, people who you’d think would’ve had a clue.  How can that be? It may have something to do with a luxury penthouse in the Bahamas. That’s where 30-year-old Bankman-Fried is roommates with the inner circle who ran his now-struggling crypto exchange FTX and trading giant Alameda Research.  Many are former co-workers from quantitative trading firm Jane Street, others he met at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, his alma mater. All 10 are, or used to be, paired up in romantic relationships with each other. That includes Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, whose firm played a central role in the company's collapse – and who, at times, has dated Bankman-Fried, according to people familiar with the matter.  CoinDesk spoke to several current and former FTX and Alameda employees who agreed to talk on the condition of anonymity, citing ongoing harassment and death threats due to the exchange’s solvency issues. And they said essentially this: It’s a place full of conflicts of interest, nepotism and lack of oversight.  “The whole operation was run by a gang of kids in the Bahamas,” a person familiar with the matter told CoinDesk on the condition of anonymity.  FTX and Alameda employees CoinDesk interviewed say they have been kept in the dark about the events of the past week, adding that only CEO Bankman-Fried’s inner circle may have had knowledge that the exchange, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, siphoned customer funds into corporate sibling Alameda.  “It’s been radio silence from Sam,” a second Bankman-Fried employee told CoinDesk on Wednesday. “When we saw the CZ [CEO Changpeng Zhao] tweet saying Binance was going to buy FTX, we honestly thought it was fake. But then Sam’s tweet just confirmed it.”  Bankman-Fried finally addressed employees later on Wednesday – a week after a CoinDesk article set the crisis in motion – writing, “I completely understand if you want to step away,” per an internal message to employees viewed by CoinDesk.  Among his nine housemates are FTX co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Gary Wang, FTX Director of Engineering Nishad Singh and Ellison of Alameda, Bankman-Fried’s trading business that’s at the center of the current chaos and on which the Wall Street Journal reported got $10 billion of FTX customer money. The remaining six are also FTX employees.  “Gary, Nishad and Sam control the code, the exchange's matching engine and funds,” the first person familiar with the matter said. “If they moved them around or input their own numbers, I'm not sure who would notice.""  A third person familiar with how the company operated said: “They’ll do anything for each other.”  Bankman-Fried and Ellison did not respond to a request for comment sent directly to them. Wang and Singh could not be reached for comment. A spokesperson for FTX was also asked to pass on CoinDesk’s request for comment to Bankman-Fried, Ellison, Wang and Singh.  Bankman-Fried’s father, Stanford Law professor Joseph Bankman, also plays a role at the company. He appeared on an episode of the ""FTX Podcast"" in August, describing charity and regulation-related projects in which he was involved in for the company.  Wang, Singh and Ellison also comprise the board of Bankman-Fried’s FTX Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the company. Several housemates, including Bankman-Fried and Ellison, are active participants in effective altruism, a movement that “aims to find the best ways to help others,” possibly through philanthropy.  In the Bahamas, FTX and Alameda’s offices are also located steps apart in a coworking compound that also housed Solana developers and other crypto incubation projects.  “All of the stakeholders would have a hard look at FTX governance,” tweeted Bankman-Fried on Thursday. “I will not be around if I'm not wanted.”  While some FTX employees have voiced approval for Bankman-Fried’s more frequent communication of late, others are not so consoled.  “Some employees kept their life savings on FTX,” the second anonymous employee told CoinDesk. “We trusted that everything was fine.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | BNB,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/10/bankman-frieds-cabal-of-roommates-in-the-bahamas-ran-his-crypto-empire-and-dated-other-employees-have-lots-of-questions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/71ce84fc776ce517936d1440e2e3fe7b06950592-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto market weathers FTX contagion,"Solana ( SOL-USD ) tokens soared 42.3% in Thursday afternoon trading as most major cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) +14% and ethereum ( ETH-USD ) +20.3% , pared a solid chunk of this week's losses following softer inflation figures for October . The upswings throughout the cryptoverse came even as Sam Bankman-Fried's imploding FTX crypto exchange continues to steal the spotlight. Following an abrupt liquidity crunch, FTX has been on a capital-raising spree, only to be denied by rival Binance in what was a short-lived non-binding bailout agreement. Since then, FTX has reportedly held talks with a number of investors for raising $9.4B to rescue the once-mighty firm. It's important to note that Solana ( SOL-USD ) has deep ties with SBF's crumbling crypto empire, as a big portion its coin supply was said to have been controlled by FTX as well as its sister company Alameda Research, a trading firm of which its finances were recently brought into question. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that FTX loaned out billions of dollars worth of customer funds to back risky wagers by Alameda. Despite Solana's ( SOL-USD ) monster move to the upside Thursday, it remains some 47% lower in the past five sessions and -90% year-to-date, in a similar downward spiral seen among the major names. Solana's ( SOL-USD ) wild price action in the past few days also comes as over 31M tokens, accounting for ~5.4% of total supply, were unstaked from the blockchain's security mechanism. Solana Foundation, which supports the development of the blockchain, said Thursday that it opted not to stake 28.5M tokens overnight, in a move that could have increased supply thus push SOL price down, according to a release .

42414962,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBVSTy,1668112833,Revisiting MicroStrategy's Pain Points as Bitcoin Tumbles,"MicroStrategy (MSTR) Executive Chairman Michael Saylor told CNBC he’s not straying from his strategy of buying and holding bitcoin (BTC) despite the crypto’s plunge to a new two-year low this week.  Bitcoin's price tumbled below $16,000 Thursday in the wake of beleaguered crypto exchange FTX's collapse. Following a modest bounce on the release of U.S. consumer price index data Thursday morning, BTC is now hovering slightly above $17,000.  While acknowledging it’s been a “roller coaster,” the famed bitcoin bull said that bitcoin is 33% higher than when he first began buying in 2020, and that MicroStrategy’s stock is up 38% during that period – outperforming the major averages and such popular tech mega-cap names as Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN).  “Our shareholders are winning, and we're going to stick with that strategy because it's working for us,” he said.  Of course, MicroStrategy made many sizable subsequent purchases of bitcoin – some backed with large amounts of debt – after that first buy. It now holds more than 129,000 coins purchased at an average price of over $30,000. With bitcoin at around $17,000, questions are again arising as to whether MicroStrategy might have to be a forced seller despite Saylor’s continued bullishness.  It’s a question that was asked earlier this year on the company's first-quarter earnings call (with bitcoin at about $30,000), and then-outgoing Chief Financial Officer Phong Le suggested a price at or below $21,000 could serve as a trigger point for a margin call. Saylor, however, was quick to clarify those remarks, taking to Twitter to clearly delineate MicroStrategy's obligations in regard to its bitcoin-backed loans.  ""MicroStrategy has a $205 million term loan and needs to maintain $410 million as collateral,"" he wrote. He further noted the company had more than 115,000 unencumbered bitcoin (then worth about $3 billion and today worth roughly $2 billion) with which it could pledge as needed. He did acknowledge that should the price fall below $3,562, the company would run out of bitcoin to use as collateral, but even then could post other assets.  ""We're excited about bitcoin [because] it's something greater than all of us,"" said Saylor today. ""We're actually buying into a protocol which is spreading all across the earth to solve a problem.""

42414979,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBVTqs,1668112635,Solana’s SOL Surges After Blockchain's Foundation Delays Plan to Unstake Tokens,"A record 31 million of the Solana blockhain’s SOL tokens were unstaked Thursday from the blockchain’s security mechanism, a day after crypto analysts warned that some investors might be seeking to redeem their holdings as the price of the digital assets tanked.  But the price of SOL surged in digital-asset markets after the Solana Foundation, which supports development on the blockchain, said it would postpone a plan to unstake some 28.5 million tokens.  A total of 63 million SOL was previously ready to be unstaked at the conclusion of the Solana blockchain’s “epoch 370” staking lockup period, according to a statement from the Solana Foundation on Thursday.  The foundation had tweeted late Wednesday that about 28.5 million SOL tokens scheduled to be unstaked had been re-staked due to a policy change of cloud service provider Hetzner on Nov. 2.  Those tokens are owned by the Solana Foundation’s treasury and had been staked as part of a delegation program, according to the tweet.  “While 28.5M SOL was in the process of being unstaked during this epoch, the plan to unstake has now been postponed, and all 28.5M SOL have now been re-staked,” according to the tweet thread.  The FTX connection  The SOL price fall appeared to be tied to speculation surrounding this week's drama involving the rapid deterioration of erstwhile billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire, including the FTX exchange and Alameda Research trading firm.  Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko, told CoinDesk on Monday that SOL is Alameda's second-largest holding, and it also holds significant amounts of SOL ecosystem tokens including MAPS and OXY.  The speculation was Alameda might need to dump its SOL tokens to raise liquidity.  SOL’s price recently rose 27% to around $17 after plunging as low as $12 in the past 24 hours. (Crypto markets were broadly higher; the CoinDesk Market Index jumped 11%.)  Solana didn’t specify the exact change of the data center provider that caused the restaking action, after a request for comment from CoinDesk. Hetzner didn’t immediately return for comment as of press time.  A new Solana staking epoch  An “epoch” on the Solana blockchain refers to the time period when staking rewards are earned and then issued. Validators will lock in their stake on the blockchain during this period, which takes about two days, and can choose to unlock the tokens once the epoch is over.  The new epoch period, known as 371, started Thursday morning, with currently around 660,000 SOL tokens, worth more than $11 million, already scheduled to unstake after the lock-in period ends, according to Solana Compass.  Eliézer Ndinga, director of research at crypto investment products firm 21.co, said that some operational indicators of the Solana blockchain, such as user adoption, still look healthy.  The number of applications built on top and the retention rate of the developers is also “a testament” to the ecosystem's overall health, Ndinga said.  “I believe that there is nothing that is structurally damaging for the Solana adoption itself,” he told CoinDesk. “Solana should come up stronger as long as, of course,"" [it remains].",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | RESEARCH,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/10/solanas-sol-surges-after-blockchains-foundation-delays-plan-to-unstake-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a725a74d2ce68cac9490ede8de43044fc9a540a0-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The non-U.S. portion of FTX came under an overwhelming amount of withdrawal requests over the weekend, but it failed to fill those requests and thus it faced a liquidity crunch. Shortly thereafter the liquidity-strapped exchange came close to selling itself to rival Binance, but the latter quickly stepped away from its non-binding agreement, citing fund mishandling and regulatory issues. Now FTX is reportedly scrambling to raise $9.4B from potential investors, but the desired rescue package isn't close to coming to fruition. ""It's surprising to me that Sam is still pursuing that line of trying to raise money for this venture,"" Armstrong told CNBC in an interview. The Coinbase ( COIN ) chief noted that SBF approached him ""in the mode of trying to raise financing, emergency financing."" Coinbase said earlier this week that it has minimal exposure to FTX and zero exposure to FTX token ( FTT-USD ), the crypto issued by FTX. ""But you know, it quickly became apparent to me that this [FTX] wasn't the type of asset that we would want to invest in if it was actually that far underwater,"" he added.

42394119,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXmXV,1668108805,The Role Regulators Played in the FTX Fiasco,"Does crypto need a backstop? Wednesday, in what in hindsight should be obvious, Binance pulled out of a tentative deal to buy out rival FTX, the crypto exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried that has lost just about everything following a bank run.  Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said after a preliminary review of FTX’s books that the risks were too big, the holes in the exchange’s balance sheet too large and the loss of investors’ confidence “severe.” That has left Bankman-Fried to search elsewhere for capital – a monumental ask, considering other exchanges have already turned down appeals for investments or mergers.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  On Twitter, Bankman-Fried said he’d do what he can to shore up users’ losses before reimbursing investors, in part by “winding down” his hedge fund Alameda Research. FTX, now worth approximately $1, according to Bloomberg’s billionaire team, had raised $1.8 billion from the likes of BlackRock, SoftBank, Tiger Global and the Ontario (Canada) Teachers' Pension Plan.  The potential contagion here is severe. Firms like Sequoia and Galaxy Digital are writing off millions of dollars, Solana (aka “SamCoin”) is buckling and dozens of projects in which SBF invested, often using the FTT exchange token, could have massive treasury shortfalls.  Read more: Who Still Has Exposure to FTX?  As crypto learned with the collapse of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, the industry is remarkably interconnected. In fact, emerging evidence suggests Alameda’s financial troubles began after losing half a billion dollars to Voyager Digital, which SBF later bought out, which had collapsed after Terra imploded.  Instead of using trustless financial protocols, they put their faith in megalomaniac personalities with Wall Street credentials.  The whole point of crypto was to enable people to “be their own bank” through self-custody and self-reliance. Instead, the industry has recreated the centralized financial system – “bank runs” and all. Instead of interacting directly with blockchains and peers, people park their funds on centralized exchanges. Instead of using trustless financial protocols, they put their faith in megalomaniac personalities with Wall Street credentials.  In the wake of the most recent crypto crisis, three U.S. regulators – the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) – are reportedly deepening investigations into FTX, some of which had begun months ago.  SEC Chairman Gary Gensler used this moment almost to gloat, noting the “toxic combination” at play at FTX, in an interview with CNBC. He reiterated familiar lines that cryptos are securities and should be under his agency’s supervision, that the industry has been “significantly non-compliant” and exchanges should “come in and talk to us.”  To some extent, Gensler is right in saying that rules already exist that would protect crypto investors. It’s notable that FTX.US, the independently operated wing of SBF’s trading empire, seems to be solvent. Of course, it could blow up tomorrow, but something tells me SBF wouldn’t have played the same shenanigans with FTX.US users’ funds as he seems to have done with the parent company – no matter how sleep-deprived he was.  And yet, any account of the situation has to note the role U.S. crypto regulation (or the lack of it) has played in the FTX fiasco. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong argued on Twitter that the simultaneously stringent-yet-unclear regulatory landscape pushed people like Terra’s Do Kwon and Bankman-Fried overseas, where oversight is lax and taxes go unpaid. Some 95% of crypto trading occurs outside the U.S., he said.  Armstrong is protecting his own interests here, now that figures like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Gensler are calling for tighter regulation of U.S. exchanges. Clearer rules are clearly needed but have to be done right. Given the inherently borderless nature of crypto, if regulators get overly burdensome, they would only succeed in creating the next Singapore-based Terra or Bahamas-based FTX. “[P]unishing U.S. companies for this makes no sense,” Armstrong added.  What also makes no sense is the SEC’s history of enforcement actions. This year, as the industry burned, the SEC sued Kim Kardashian for promoting Ethereum Max (a coin few will remember) and something called Hydrogen Technology Corp.

4046545,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=510263,1668108716,Bitcoin Eyes $18K Following Good US Inflation Report,"The crypto market and Bitcoin trend over the past few days have been entirely unexpected. The market is feeling the heat from the bears as most of the crypto assets took to the south. Moreover, the FTX crisis has increasingly brought a different contagious negative performance in the space. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Data: Selling From Whales Holding 1k+ BTC Behind Crash Bitcoin had a complicated swing as the token dropped from its critical level of $20K. The price of BTC has dipped to around $16K region. The entire situation and unfolding of events are creating more fear and doubts for most participants in the crypto industry. However, the primary crypto asset has shown signs of revival during some minutes in today’s trading hours. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics has just released the latest report on the inflation rate in the country. Unfortunately, the data for the Consumer Price Index for October is out. CPI Data Beats Expectations, Bitcoin Stays In Recovery Mode According to the data, CPI for October reads 7.7%, indicating an increase of 0.4% through its seasonal adjustment. This latest report proves to be better than expected. Hence, Bitcoin reacted positively within some minutes after the news was out. Due to the current flow in the general economy, most expectations for the CPI report were around 8%. But the reality of the value has brought a positive change in the crypto market. According to data, the price of BTC suddenly surged to $17,800 before going down again. The token is currently trading between $17,278 and $17,400. Compared with the September CPI data of 8.2%, this latest CPI report proves excellent news. The core CPI data rose by 0.3% without food and energy in October. This trend is slower than the expected 0.5%, a drop from 0.6% in September. The yearly comparison shows that the core CPI surged by 6.3% in October, below the expected 6.5% rise and dropping from 6.6% in September. Implications of CPI Reports The CPI reports are one of the measures the US Federal Reserve uses to determine the inflation rate in the country. Therefore, this October’s data is an essential report for the Fed before the usual Federal Open Market Committee (FMOC). The year’s next and final FOMC meeting has been slated on December 14-15. The FOMC will likely hike its benchmark for Fed Funds rate again at the meeting. If it happens, it will mark the 7th time such a rate increase occurred in 2022. The Fed has been taking a hawkish stance in controlling inflation. It has been increasing the interest rates by 75bps in some months due to higher CPI data.

A spokesman for Binance declined to comment on the discussions. A Washington-based FTX official didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Bitcoin Supply In Loss Spikes Up Following The Latest Crash As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC supply in loss has set a new record for this year following the FTX disaster. The “supply in loss” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin that’s currently being held at some loss. This metric works by looking at the on-chain history of each coin in the circulating supply to see what price it was last moved at.

The current loss value is a new record for the 2022 bear market, and is also in fact the highest the indicator has been since the COVID black swan event back in 2020. Notably, the amount of underwater supply in the market was also at similar levels back in late 2018, when the bear market of that cycle set its bottom.

As is apparent from the chart, in the 2018-19 bear the market moved mostly sideways after the bottom, and also formed another peak of similar loss values, before some bullish wind returned to Bitcoin.

The announcement came just hours after Bankman-Fried said in a Twitter thread that FTX US was ""100% liquid,"" in contrast to FTX International, the global crypto trading company that's currently seeking funding to fill a reported $10 billion hole.  In that same thread, Bankman-Fried announced that Alameda Research, another related entity, would be winding down.  FTX (the global entity) halted withdrawals earlier this week after facing over $5 billion' worth of withdrawals on Sunday. The company appeared to have begun reopening some withdrawals on Thursday, although most users were still unable to withdraw funds as of press time.

The news comes shortly after SBF reportedly told investors on Wednesday that FTX would need to file for bankruptcy in the absence of a capital injection. The once-mighty exchange faced up to $8B in a liquidity shortfall. Those discussions included obtaining about $1B from Tron token ( TRX-USD ) founder Justin Sun, $1B from crypto exchange OKX, $1B from stablecoin issuer Tether and $2B from a consortium of investment funds, the person told Reuters, noting that the rest of the funding would come from other investors, including multi-billion dollar hedge fund Third Point. SBF's desired rescue package, though, has made little progress in coming to fruition, the person added. The implosion of SBF's crypto empire rumbles on as FTX scrambles for capital. The exchange signed a non-binding deal earlier this week to sell its non-U.S. business to rival Binance, but the latter backed away from the agreement just a day later due to issues that ""are beyond our control or ability to help.""

Johnson.  Johnson told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” the CFTC, along with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are currently “limited” in their ability to engage in enforcement activities with crypto exchanges. The gray area is even more muddled because FTX is a Bahamas-based crypto exchange, not based in the U.S.  “There is a regulatory gap that really limits our ability,” Johnson said, and thus Congress needs to act to clear the fog on crypto regulation. FTX being on the verge of collapse gives Congress plenty of reasons to act, and is a prime example of “never letting a good crisis go to waste,” she said.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Says Alameda Winding Down, Promises FTX US Customers' Funds Are 'Fine'  Had the CFTC regulated FTX, Johnson added, its outcome might’ve likely looked different.  “If FTX had been a regulated entity under our regulatory umbrella, customer bonds would’ve been protected, there would’ve been liquidity reserve requirements in place [and] there would’ve been monitoring and surveillance that is not immediately available,” she pointed out.  She added that she is “hopeful” Congress will make an effort to address the lingering questions by “giving clear direction to the SEC and the CFTC” as to how each agency should proceed in future, while ensuring that each agency “has the resources to accomplish those tasks.”  Global markets are fragile in nature, Johnson said, and in order to “protect markets and investors, the best path forward is clear legislation.”  Read more: Crypto Execs Ask for Clearer US Regulatory Policy After FTX Collapse",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/10/never-let-a-good-crisis-go-to-waste-cftc-commissioner-calls-on-congress-to-act-after-ftx-debacle,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d2f5b07607053ce71b17b3a2682aea8b29f46e5-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420793,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYH5p,1668100666,"FTX Violated Its Own Terms of Service and Misused User Funds, Lawyers Say","Sam Bankman-Fried’s embattled cryptocurrency exchange FTX may have misused customer funds in violation of its own terms of service, lawyers have told CoinDesk.  FTX’s downward spiral, which began after a CoinDesk article last week about its sister company Alameda Research’s financials, prompted the exchange to halt customer withdrawals on Tuesday, indicating it did not have the required funds to cover all the crypto locked on its platform.  But the exchange’s terms of service states that none of the crypto in customer accounts are “the property of, or shall or may be loaned to, FTX Trading,” and that the platform “does not represent or treat Digital Assets in User’s Accounts as belonging to FTX Trading.” In other words, FTX cannot use the funds for purposes other than just holding them on customers’ behalf.  Citing people close to the matter, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that FTX had placed billions of dollars worth of customer funds on risky bets, with some suspecting customer funds were used to help bolster Alameda.  “Using customers’ investments to support Alameda Research is a serious problem and could amount to claims for fraudulent breach of trust,” said Louise Abbott, a disputes solicitor in the U.K. who deals with cryptocurrency and asset recovery at Keystone Law.  Speaking with CoinDesk, three other lawyers are in agreement with Abbott, saying FTX’s actions appear to point to a misappropriation of customer investments.  “If you were an FTX customer, you should have felt very safe because they were telling you that they weren't going to do anything with your belongings,” said Matthew Nyman of the digital assets and Web3 practice at the law firm CMS. “And if it turns out that they breached their word, using those funds to lend to Alameda or anyone else, then that's even worse, because they held themselves to a higher standard.”  Twitter user @wassielawyer, who was one of the first to flag the Terms of Service, went even further, saying, “FTX was literally stealing customer funds.”  Although FTX’s quick collapse following the CoinDesk article and a Twitter-spat between Bankman-Fried and rival Changpeng Zhao of Binance suggests the exchange had misused user funds, Nyman says it may not constitute actual theft. He added that it is a technical difference and a serious wrong either way.  The provision made in the terms of service stipulating that customers retained title to their assets will be particularly important if the company ends up facing insolvency, Nyman said. With Binance backing out of a buyout and Alameda winding down services, FTX could file for bankruptcy in Antigua and Barbuda, where it was incorporated.  But there might be a silver lining, Nyman said. Because the terms of service specify that customer funds do not belong to FTX, those funds cannot be used to pay back creditors or other stakeholders in the event of insolvency. The lines may blur, however, for those customers who opted into a yield-earning program, because those funds were not subject to the same retention of title provisions and can therefore get caught up as assets in a bankruptcy case.  Beyond any civil actions taken by FTX users who cannot access their funds, misappropriation of customer funds could lead to criminal charges. The U.S. Department of Justice is already investigating FTX, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.  FTX’s Japan unit was ordered by regulators to suspend all operations after it halted withdrawals without specifying a date for reinstatement and without stopping the onboarding of new customers.  ""It is necessary to take all possible measures to prevent a situation in which [Japanese customers' assets] are leaked to a [foreign] affiliated company,"" Japan’s Financial Services Agency said in its suspension order.

Customer withdrawals were halted at FTX earlier this week after the exchange was reportedly overwhelmed with some $6B of withdrawal requests over the weekend.

The blockchain-era version of an epic bank run culminated Nov. 8 when the exchange led by Sam Bankman-Fried announced a halt to withdrawals. (On Thursday there were fresh reports that some withdrawal requests were suddenly getting processed, although some Twitter posters wrote that they have since been shut off.)  The data, from Arkham Intelligence, might be a conservative estimate of FTX’s balance history because there may be wallet addresses that haven’t been disclosed to the public.  FTX’s average total balances between Oct. 1 and Nov. 4 was $7.9 billion, and stood at $8.4 billion as of Nov. 5, Arkham data shows. The balances then dropped considerably to $1.1 billion as of Nov. 10.  The rush for the exits coincided with a steep plunge in the price of the FTX’s in-house exchange token, FTT.  From Oct. 1 through Nov. 4, the FTT price ranged from a lower bound of $22 and an upper bound of $26. Then, all of a sudden, the floor fell out: FTT had sunk to about $2 as of press time.  Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) tweeted Thursday that FTX “saw roughly $5 [billion] of withdrawals on Sunday.”  The immense scope of this black swan-style event serves as a key reminder of just how rapidly confidence can erode in the parallel financial universe of digital assets – where there are no central banks to bail out the key players – as happened in 2008 when nearly all of Wall Street ran short of liquidity and had to turn to the Federal Reserve for emergency funding.  FTX’s ETH Balance  Drilling down, the balance of ether (ETH) on FTX has fallen some 88%, according to the blockchain analytics firm Nansen.  As of Nov. 10 at press time, FTX holds 50,544.94 ETH ($66.5 million) at time of press, down from 429,210.46 ETH ($564.8 million) on Nov. 4, the data shows.  From Oct. 21 to Nov. 4, users deposited 290,820 ETH and withdrew 15,803 ETH. With 18.4x more ETH deposits than withdrawals in that time period, user confidence in FTX was solid, but this rapidly changed.  FTX’s Bitcoin Balance  It is no surprise FTX’s bitcoin (BTC) balance also took a sharp fall.  Even as bitcoin’s price held steady around $20,000 earlier in the week, FTX’s BTC holdings started nosediving on Nov. 7, according to data from Coinglass. FTX held 21,850 bitcoins across all exchanges on Nov. 6, and by the next day, FTX’s balance dropped to virtually nil.  Around the same time, bitcoin’s price started falling, as crypto analysts fretted that larger cryptocurrencies might get caught up in a broader wave of selling across digital-asset markets.  On Nov. 6, BTC was changing hands around the $21,000 level.

ETH’s price continues to look bearish with the market’s current state, as things look uncertain for most traders and investors. ETH’s price bounces from a low of $1,100 on the daily timeframes as the price aims for the 50 and 200 Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) In the last two days, the crypto market has been erratic, with the price of many altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), battling for survival after the news that Binance would not be taking over FTX after conducting due diligence. Previous weeks saw the price of Ethereum (ETH) perform well, rallying from a low of $1,200 to a high of $1,600. Most altcoins trend higher as many produced gains of over 200%, including DOGE rallying from a region of $0.55 to a high of $0.15, with many hoping for more recovery bounce. Still, these expectations were cut short by the uncertainty surrounding the crypto market. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: Amid FTX Rumors Tether’s USDT Peg Of $1 Wobbles – What’s Going On? Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The previous week saw many altcoins produced over 200% gains over the past 7 days of breaking out of their range-bound movement, as many believe more hope is returning to the crypto space. The new week has yet to look like the previous as the week has looked choked with FUD (Fear of uncertainty and doubt), leading to many altcoins being affected negatively in price as major coins have been struggling to stay afloat from what looks like a crypto purge. The news of Binance rescuing the situation by taking over FTX was good. Still, after conducting their due diligence, Binance decided it would not take over FTX as this has affected the market negatively, sending the price of ETH on a spiral movement to $1,100. The price of ETH continued to look bearish after breaking below its weekly low of $1,100; the price swiftly bounced off this region as price rallied back to the high of $1,300, looking somewhat safe. The price of ETH needs to rally away from $1,200, acting as a demand zone to remain safe from sell-off. Weekly resistance for the price of ETH – $1,450. Weekly support for the price of ETH – $1,100. Price Analysis Of ETH On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of ETH remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $1,200 support after bouncing off from the region of $1,100, which saw the price of ETH losing its demand zone to the bears. If the price of ETH breaks above $1,450, we could see more rally for ETH price, but the market is still early; we would want to give it time and watch how it responds to the market situation. Daily resistance for the ETH price – $1,450. Daily support for the ETH price – $1,200. Related Reading: MANA Loses 80% Of Its Value Over The Last 12 Months – No More Blessings To Come?

Over the past few days, the FTX token (FTT) has lost more than 70% of its value. The events seem to have unlocked the bears into the market. As a result, the cumulative market cap has drastically decreased, indicating an overall negative performance. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Data: Selling From Whales Holding 1k+ BTC Behind Crash Also, several other crypto assets have been in the south. For example, Bitcoin has experienced more downward pull this week. The price of BTC has dipped by almost 21% in just five days. The primary crypto asset, Bitcoin, now trades at $17,745, showing in increase The impact of the bearish crypto market is gradually spreading. The largest global institutional Bitcoin fund, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), has been caught in the web of the crisis. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Caught In The Web Of FTX Crumble A report revealed that GBTC ended the day at a record discount of 41%. Its price was $8.76 per share. The BTC trust has been plummeting for almost a year since November 12, 2021, after hitting its high of $51.47 per share. GBTC has a structure issue since it is an investment trust fund. Hence, it lacks the free creation of its shares or a suitable redemption program. Such a lapse offers significant price discrepancies against the fund’s underlying BTC holdings. Subsequently, Grayscale has been attempting to convert GBTC to an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This will enable the market maker to create and redeem shares and permanently reduce the premium and discount of its shares. Having filed its application in October 2021, Grayscale now awaits the decision of the Security Exchange Commission (SEC). However, the SEC officially denied the firm’s allocation in converting GBTC to a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 29. The denial didn’t go down well with Grayscale, as the company took the matter to court. It filed the opening legal brief on October 11, challenging the decision of the SEC.

This revealed that the firm holds a large amount of FTX Token (FTT), the native token of the FTX crypto exchange. The fact that a prominent trading firm holds a massive amount of a token raised concern in the crypto community. Hence, there were multiple questions regarding the relationship between FTX and Alameda.

Most users are still unable to withdraw their funds from the FTX exchange, leading to speculation on Twitter that some types of users, or staff, were getting preferential treatment.

Crypto Fear And Greed Index Now Points To A State Of “Extreme Fear” The “fear and greed index” is an indicator that measures the general sentiment among investors in the crypto market. The metric uses a numeric scale that runs from zero to hundred for displaying this sentiment. All values above fifty imply a greedy market, while those below the threshold suggest fearful holders. Values of more than 75 and less than 25 denote special sentiments called “extreme greed” and “extreme fear,” respectively. The significance of extreme greed is that cyclical tops in Bitcoin and other coins have tended to form during periods with this sentiment. On the other hand, bottoms have usually formed in stretches where the market has been extremely fearful.

The current production cost is about $15,000, though it's likely to revisit the $13,000 it hit in recent months, implying a decline of around 25% from here, the bank noted.  On the optimistic front, JPMorgan said the hit to crypto’s overall market cap may be less than after Terra as deleveraging has been occurring.

Alameda Research, the sister company of FTX, ""is winding down trading"" and ""one way or another, soon they won't be trading on FTX anymore,"" the 30-year-old billionaire wrote. At the start of the week, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said his firm would sell its holdings in FTX token ( FTT-USD ), the crypto coin issued by FTX, after questions were raised about the overlap between FTX and SBF's hedge fund Alameda. SBF also promised that FTX US ""users are fine."" Note that FTX's American division had nothing to do with Binance's short-lived offer to buy the non-U.S. portion of FTX. Despite FTX's ongoing liquidity crunch, SBF claimed there's still a chance of survival, noting ""there are a number of players who we are in talks with, LOIs, term sheets, etc.” He told investors on Wednesday that his exchange would need to file for bankruptcy unless it can garner more capital. In seeking a sizable capital injection, FTX tapped crypto exchange Kraken for a potential deal, two sources with knowledge on the matter told Axios, adding the talks could easily come apart. Neither FTX nor Kraken immediately responded to Seeking Alpha's request for comment. Overall, ""I f****d up, and should have done better,"" he wrote, adding that he should've been more transparent with communication. SBF also said he misjudged users' margin given ""a poor internal labeling of bank-related accounts,"" which was once of the main reasons why Binance backed away from its proposed FTX acquisition.

As of around 10:00 a.m. ET, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) slipped 0.3% to $17.58K in the past day, up from as low as $15.66K in the prior session, but down from $20.86K at the start of the week. Crypto investors appear to be partly shaking off their concerns about crypto exchange FTX's liquidity crisis and the potential ripple effects throughout the crypto ecosystem. Ether ( ETH-USD ) gained 7.5% to $1.31K in the past day compared with the $1.09K trough on November 9 and $1.58K at November 7. Headline inflation for October rose 0.4% M/M and 7.7% Y/Y versus September's +0.4% and +8.2%, respectively. That had traders boosting their bets for a slower rate hike at the Federal Reserve's December gathering. As such, CME's FedWatch tool showed that traders priced in a 80.6% chance for a 50-basis-point increase compared with a 56.8% probability a day ago. Recall Fed policymakers lifted the central bank's benchmark rate by 75 bps in the past four meetings, marking the current rate-hiking cycle the most aggressive one since the 1980s. Note that Fed officials, including central banking leader Jerome Powell, had already signaled that they expect the pace of rate hikes to slow, though the ultimate level of rates could be even higher than they previously projected. Earlier, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said he sees the Fed slowing its pace of rate hikes in the coming months, ""in light of the cumulative tightening we have achieved."" With digital tokens trimming their losses, crypto-related stocks changed hands deep in the green, with MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) +10.1% , Coinbase Global ( COIN ) +11% , Greenidge Generation ( GREE ) +13.8% , and Core Scientific ( CORZ ) +12.5% making the biggest upside moves. The bullish swings also came in the wake of soaring equities across the board as well as tumbling Treasury yields.

From its 2017 high of $5.85, MANA has dropped 80% in value in the last 12 months, as shown by the most recent available data. Presently, a share of MANA can be purchased for as little as $0.4773. Investor confidence has tanked in light of the current market situation, making a comeback for the crypto a little difficult. As a result, the question arises as to whether MANA has any chance of survival or whether it is a cryptocurrency that has already passed its expiration date. Related Reading: ETC Price And Social Dominance Figures Down In Last 7 Days – What’s Next? Tough Road Ahead For MANA Investors, traders, and would-be buyers should not expect MANA’s current position to work miracles, as the market has turned hostile due to the panic caused by the ongoing FTX disaster Technically, the token is not doing very well either. Token prices are hovering above the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement line. Furthermore, it has recently experienced a reversal in price action. The RSI readings, which are currently in the oversold portion of their range, lend credence to this theory. However, the Chaikin Money Flow index is not promising. Chart: TradingView The current reading of -0.25 for this indicator suggests that bears are in complete control of the market. The current trading range for the day sits between $0.4566 and $0.7389. The connection between the token and the Metaverse may have contributed to a number of price-increasing variables. Recently, a parcel of Metaverse land in Decentraland was purchased for $15,585, or approximately 30,000 MANA coins. Such advancements bring MANA and Decentraland into the limelight, increasing interest in the coin and the protocol. However, these may be short-term improvements. Despite the developing retreat, the EMA ribbon continues to suggest shorting the currency as the downtrend persists. Crypto Winter Freezes The Token As the crypto winter freezes MANA from its tracks, the token’s price can either breach the present support at $0.4566 and fall to a new low of $0.3522, or it can breach the immediate resistance at $0.5287. However, bulls should defend the $0.4566 support line, as a breach of this line could spark further selling. Investors and traders in MANA should also monitor the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum, as MANA has a correlation of 0.98 and 0.94 with the two leading cryptocurrencies, respectively. When the market rebounds, MANA will follow the performance of the other two cryptocurrencies. But for the time being, bulls should concentrate on consolidation and possibly target the 61.80 Fib level.

FTX announced its plans in a tweet, adding that FTX Japan ""is a separate entity that strictly follows the Japanese regulation on asset segregation.""  The FSA said it wanted FTX Japan to halt its crypto asset exchange business and stop accepting new customers until Dec. 9, effective immediately.  The order comes as Sam Bankman-Fried's international cryptocurrency exchange FTX continues its downward spiral after it suffered a liquidity crunch following a CoinDesk article scrutinizing the financials of its sister company, Alameda Research. Although rival exchange Binance initially agreed to acquire FTX, Binance has since backed out of a possible buyout.  In its order, the FSA cites the fact that FTX Japan halted withdrawals for customers in the country without specifying a date for reinstatement and while it continues to enlist new customers.A source told CoinDesk that FTX Japan had indeed halted withdrawals.Under the circumstances, the regulator said it was uncertain about FTX Japan's health.  ""It is necessary to take all possible measures to prevent a situation in which [Japanese customers' assets] are leaked to a [foreign] affiliated company,"" the order said.  The FSA's suspension order is accompanied by a ""business improvement order,"" which requires FTX Japan to accurately identify users, strive to protect users' assets and ""appropriately disseminate information to users regarding the protection of their assets.""  FTX Japan is also required to submit a ""written business improvement plan"" for fixing the cited issues by Nov. 16.

Further, Coinbase said it has no exposure to FTX's token FTT – which plunged about 80% Tuesday – and no exposure to FTXs' sister company, Alameda Research.  “While COIN has minimal exposure to FTX, before there is enough evidence that the contagion risk is contained, the pressure on crypto prices will likely weigh on COIN,” Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau told clients in a research note Thursday morning. The firm lowered its price target to $89 from $107, maintaining an outperform stock rating.  Coinbase shares slumped about 22% this week through Wednesday. They rose 12% to $51.50 in early trading Thursday.

The 30-year-old former billionaire took to Twitter to say Alameda Research – his empire’s once mighty crypto quant shop and market maker – would go dark “one way or another.” Of FTX, his upstart derivatives exchange that became the crypto industry’s darling, he said it will “embrace radical transparency” – if it continues operating at all.  Bankman-Fried also shut down rumors that Alameda was attempting to short – and possibly destabilize – tether, the largest stablecoin by market capitalization. On Thursday morning, the price of tether traded down to 97 cents and to even as low as 93 cents on the crypto exchange Kraken.  He also promised the users of FTX.US that their funds were ""fine,"" echoing a claim he made about FTX immediately before revealing that the exchange was not, in fact, fine.  Alameda came under scrutiny last week after CoinDesk published a balance sheet suggesting it had heavy holdings of the FTT token – an exchange token issued by FTX, Alameda’s sister company also founded by Bankman-Fried.  Read more: Divisions in Sam Bankman-Fried’s Crypto Empire Blur on His Trading Titan Alameda’s Balance Sheet  Although the CEO assured customers that his company was fine, repeatedly saying on Twitter that he had no solvency issues, on Tuesday he revealed that he was facing liquidity concerns and had come to an agreement with crypto exchange Binance to acquire FTX. That deal fell apart a day later.  On Thursday, Bankman-Fried suggested FTX might still survive, saying, “There are a number of players who we are in talks with, LOIs (letters of intent), term sheets, etc.”  “We'll see how that ends up,” he added.  ‘I was off’  In his thread, Bankman-Fried tried to explain his company’s situation, saying FTX “poorly” labeled bank-related accounts internally, and so he misjudged users’ margins. Customers withdrew $5 billion worth of assets on Sunday, but had the liquidity to support only 80% of that, with leverage 1.7 times what FTX had.  “FTX International currently has a total market value of assets/collateral higher than client deposits (moves with prices!),” he said in another tweet.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Top Stories  Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain, has put himself forward as beleaguered crypto exchange FTX’s savior. Sam Bankman-Fried’s firm is once again staring down the barrel after rival exchange Binance said it was walking away from the deal to acquire FTX after it scrutinized FTX’s books. Without volunteering any details, Sun tweeted that he is “putting together a solution with FTX."" Tron’s native token TRX momentarily surged 4,000% from 6 cents to $2.50 following the news. The network’s algorithmic stablecoin USDD, however, has lost its dollar peg, recently trading at 98 cents, with Sun speculating Alameda Research, the liquidity-strapped sister company of FTX, might have sold its USDD holdings, kickstarting the stablecoin's deviation.  The U.S. Consumer Price Index showed that consumer prices rose 7.7% in October from a year earlier, below both the 8.2% growth in September and the 8% increase analysts had estimated. The price of bitcoin (BTC), which has been hammered in the past few days by fears of contagion from the calamity surrounding FTX and Alameda Research, jumped 6% in the minutes after the report. The speculation is that a slower pace of inflation will allow the Federal Reserve to ease off in its campaign to tighten monetary policy – theoretically a positive for risky assets like cryptocurrencies. Ether (ETH), meanwhile, was trading at $1,291, up from earlier lows.  FTX used customer funds to prop up sister firm Alameda Research in May, according to a Reuters report, citing people familiar with the matter. CEO Sam Bankman-Fried transferred at least $4 billion from FTX to support his trading firm Alameda after it suffered a series of losses. Part of this $4 billion was customer deposits though the exact proportion couldn’t be determined. Among Alameda’s losses was a $500 million loan agreed with crypto lender Voyager Digital, which filed for bankruptcy later.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows SOL futures basis or the difference between the spot price and the futures price.  The short-term basis tanked to an annualized 355% early Thursday, hinting at record bearish sentiment.  ""There is panic in the SOL market,"" Gregoire Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said.

42420785,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYGwX,1668088800,"Washington, D.C.’s Buddy Sam Bankman-Fried Has Some Explaining to Do","Sam Bankman-Fried trafficked in ubiquity. The CEO of FTX began infiltrating Washington, D.C., last year, selling cryptocurrency as an answer to financial problems in the U.S. And he never seemed to leave.  Last month, in the span of a few days, the man known as SBF appeared at no fewer than three major Washington events, with lawmakers, prominent bankers and financial academics in the audience. In the early days, his cheerful digital campaign was met with confusion and some low-grade hostility, but in recent months, his relentlessness was starting to bear fruit.  He spoke at conferences, testified on Capitol Hill, championed crypto legislation and – possibly most importantly – became one of the highest-spending individuals in U.S. campaign finance. The genial, mysterious “billionaire” from the digital assets world, who said he wanted his industry to be regulated as soon as possible, had become the leading voice for crypto in Washington. But in a single turbulent Tuesday, that status evaporated as his global crypto behemoth admitted it was in a dire liquidity crisis and had agreed to sell itself.  The smoke hasn’t cleared, and the deal with Binance evaporated, but his rapid D.C. ascent and crash has already sent shockwaves through the crypto community that’s been growing in the U.S. capital.  Read more: Divisions in Sam Bankman-Fried’s Crypto Empire Blur on His Trading Titan Alameda’s Balance Sheet  CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham is among the many regulators who’ve met with Bankman-Fried this year. She’s been watching with everybody else what’s happened this week and said she can’t comment on an individual company. But she had a general message in response to the industry turmoil:  ""If risk management is not at the core of your business, you might not have a business for long,"" she said. “It’s time for regulators to make sure that crypto is held to the same standards as other financial firms.”  Prolific lobbyist  Bankman-Fried said at an event last month that he’s been in Washington at least once a month and spends “half [his] time on regulatory matters.” Of that, most of it is in the U.S., he said. “It’s all happening at once,” he said of the policy efforts for which he’s been meeting with lawmakers and regulatory agencies.  ""He spent a lot of time on Capitol Hill in a really important role, which was educating Congress on these very technical and – to some extent – new topics,"" Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) told CoinDesk TV on Wednesday.  And it was working. He publicly lobbied for a new bill this year in the Senate Agriculture Committee that would have given the Commodity Futures Trading Commission new powers to police digital assets trading.  “I think these developments strike a blow for the credibility of the industry in Washington, and for calls to advance regulatory legislation quickly in the name of fostering crypto innovation,” said Mark Hays, a policy analyst for Americans for Financial Reform, in an email. He said policymakers shouldn’t be “hitching their wagon to a wealthy, charismatic founder or donor who too often turns out to be not quite what he/she promises to be.”  So, will U.S. oversight be slowed and crypto’s reputation be damaged by SBF’s missteps?  “The Wild West, indeed,” suggested Paul McCaffery, the head of alternative capital sales at investment bank Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, in a research note on Wednesday. He wrote that it’s “not a good look” for the industry and that many politicians “will get scared off.”  Perianne Boring, who leads the Chamber of Digital Commerce that advocates for pro-crypto policies in Washington, said this drama effectively highlights a couple of things: the “importance of getting policy right,” and the “unique global nature of crypto.”  “It may be that policymakers will want to take a wait-and-see approach,” she said. “There is still a lot of information to be made public.”  ‘FTX is fine’  Bankman-Fried observers in Washington marveled at the clearly intelligent, youthful CEO, seeming to brandish his shorts and a T-shirt as a rejection of the capital’s formal traditions. His self-deprecating remarks and casual manner had a disarming effect for the crowds that came to see him.  But if he was trying to build a nothing-to-hide reputation, his tweets this week may have jeopardized it – and will likely be the subject of close scrutiny.  He tweeted that his company “has enough to cover all client holdings.” He wrote, “FTX is fine. Assets are fine.” Then he deleted the tweets, right after FTX’s move to seek an emergency rescue.  The future for Bankman-Fried’s FTX US, which wasn’t initially meant to be part of a sale, is uncertain, so it’s hard to say whether a CEO Bankman-Fried will return to lobby Washington. Also unknown: the future of his campaign giving, where tens of millions donated to congressional candidates made him the fourth largest political donor during the midterm primaries this year. (Though his personal fortune has waned considerably this week.)  The Democrats he supported were looking forward to him being a major source of campaign cash going forward. Bankman-Fried had become a patron beyond his narrow crypto interests when he threw a political curve ball, dismissing whether candidates had an interest in his industry and instead supporting them based on their ability to prevent the next pandemic. Some of the politicians he supported even had negative positions on the digital assets movement, to the frustration of industry efforts pushing for pro-crypto candidates.  In the vein of his famous philanthropic streak – “effective altruism” – he wanted to spend his money to help “people who will make sure to follow through on common sense things to try to not have what happened to us over the last few years happen again,” he said at a recent event.

42394123,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXmx9,1668087900,What Bitcoin’s Inflation Hedge Narrative Needs: More Time,"For nearly a decade, crypto investors and advocates have promoted bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a store of value against fiat currency. Due to the tokenomics behind bitcoin, many savvy investors believe that bitcoin is a hedge against the loss of purchasing power experienced in many fiat currencies.  Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million bitcoins. The issuance rate of bitcoin is known by all market participants and the bitcoin blockchain will eventually reach a state of 0% inflation once all the bitcoins have been mined. Many investors and bitcoin advocates believe that this economic design makes the cryptocurrency far superior to other permanently inflationary cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  The impact of value manipulation  The value of fiat currencies is determined by governments and central banks. For over a decade, the US Federal Reserve has had an inflation target of 2% for the U.S. dollar. Another way to think about inflation is in the purchasing power of the dollar decreasing. As a currency inflates, the purchasing power of that currency declines over time.  On one hand, many economists believe that by creating an inflationary currency they can spur economic growth and encourage spending in the market – which they believe strengthens the economy and business cycles.  On the other, many other schools of economics do not believe that a loss of purchasing power in an economy's main currency is beneficial to the long-term health of an economy. This disagreement and contrarian belief has led many to adopt and hold bitcoin – among other cryptocurrencies – as an alternative to fiat currency.  Read more: Why Bitcoin Has Been Highly Correlated With Fiat  Evidence of bitcoin as an inflation hedge  Bitcoin has certainly outperformed fiat currencies over the last decade. But while many fiat currencies were stable over the last decade, bitcoin’s price was not.  Bitcoin has become incredibly popular around the world, has been adopted and used in large parts of the global economy and has seen a very impressive growth rate. Bitcoin was trading under $100/coin in 2012 and reached an all-time high of nearly $70,000 in 2021, under a decade later.  The performance of bitcoin over the last decade served as further evidence of the asset being a hedge against fiat currency devaluation and strengthened its store of value investment theory.  Inflation hedge narrative shifts  In 2022, however, it has been a different story. Beginning in 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates and pull liquidity out of the market. Spurred by record high inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve took these extreme measures in order to combat inflation in the economy.  By raising interest rates and decreasing market liquidity, the Fed caused assets like stocks, bonds, real estate and even cryptocurrencies to see tremendous headwinds. U.S. stocks are down over 20% year to date, bonds are down over 30%, real estate is down over 15% and cryptocurrencies are down over 60% so far this year (as of November 2022).  Many traders describe the market we’re seeing in 2022 as a “risk-off” environment.  Bonds reassert precedence  US Treasury bonds are considered the safest investment in the world. Often described as the “risk-free rate,” these bonds provide investors with a guaranteed yield and protection of principal.  Because the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates significantly this year, the risk-free rates of U.S. Treasury bonds are higher than they have been in over a decade. Many investors see this as an opportunity to invest in government bonds – and consequently, they have been purchasing and investing in government bonds over other assets like stocks and crypto.  In fact, individuals were so eager to invest in these bonds and the web traffic of people visiting the Treasury Direct website was so high, the website couldn’t handle the traffic and crashed.  As the market shifted from a “risk-on” environment, where bond yields were low enough that individuals preferred a more speculative asset allocation, to a “risk-off” environment, cryptocurrencies have underperformed many other assets.  This underperformance has led many crypto critics to state that the inflation hedge and store of value theses behind bitcoin have been invalidated. These individuals believe that cryptocurrencies are “risk-on” assets.  In other words, when the risk-free rate in the economy is low – and U.S. government bond yields are trivial, as they were for most of the last decade – investors will flock to assets like stocks and cryptocurrency where the potential return is much higher than it is in bonds.  When the market is “risk-off,” market participants believe investors will flock to bonds over speculative assets like crypto.  Watch: Bitcoin Is Not a Pure CPI Hedge: Strategist  Bitcoin’s future as a risk asset  While cryptocurrency is still very young compared with other asset classes, these markets are helping individuals understand the driving investment thesis behind cryptocurrencies. It is important to understand all the nuances that go into global markets and investment allocations and know how to pivot when the market changes.  There has never been a time in bitcoin’s existence where the risk-free rate has been this high, and the eventual outcome will be very helpful for investment managers in the future. Whether or not Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are long-term inflation hedges and a store of value or simply a “risk-on” speculative assets preferred in times when bond yields are unattractive is yet to be perfectly understood.  This year has been significantly different than most of the last decade and the market we are currently seeing will be very beneficial to advisors who wish to better understand this new emerging asset class.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Jackson Wood,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/10/what-bitcoins-inflation-hedge-narrative-needs-more-time,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ff29f7383387877522210d4213411061c9f93c1f-6000x4500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The annual pace slowed to just 7.7% versus estimates for 8%, and down from 8.2% in September.  Bitcoin (BTC) – which plunged to a new two-year low of $15,554 on Wednesday thanks to the FTX blowup – gained a quick $1,500, or about 10%, in the minutes after the report. At press time it is trading at $17,750.  Core CPI – which strips out food and energy – rose 0.3% in October, slower than expectations for 0.5% and falling from September’s 0.6%. On an annualized basis, core CPI was up 6.3% in October slower than expectations for a 6.5% rise and falling from 6.6% in September.  October’s CPI is one of the major reports the Federal Reserve will see before the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) next and final meeting of the year Dec. 14-15. The FOMC is seen raising its benchmark fed funds rate for a seventh time in 2022 at that meeting.  Prior to this morning’s CPI print, futures traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) saw an equal chance for the FOMC to go with either a 50 or 75 basis point hike. After the report, chances for 50 basis points increased to 74%.  Behind growing expectations for the smaller move are ideas that recession risks are on the rise, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell conceding at his most recent press conference that the path to a soft landing has “narrowed.” Powell also signaled the central bank might consider a smaller rate increase in December. On the other hand, Powell said the terminal rate for this tightening cycle will likely be higher than previously forecast.  “We’ve always said it was going to be difficult, but to the extent rates have to go higher and stay higher for longer it becomes harder to see the path,” Powell said. “I would say the path has narrowed over the course of the last year.”  The Fed began its current rate hike cycle in March after inflation rose to 7.9% in February. Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June and today's report shows that pace falling below the February rate for the first time.  While bitcoin is having only a modest rally, equity futures are soaring on thoughts the inflation slowdown might mean the Fed's tightening cycle could be over sooner than previously feared. Nasdaq futures are higher by just shy of 4% and S&P 500 futures are ahead 3%. Bond markets are in rally mode as well, with the 10-year Treasury yield down a big 21 basis points to 3.93%.

Currently, rumors are circulating that Tether’s stablecoin USDT might be more affected by the downfall of FTX than it would like to admit. Moreover, there currently seems to be an attack on USDT as a result of which Tether (USDT) briefly lost its usual peg to $1. The largest stablecoin by market cap was trading below $0.9400 temporarily at Kraken, other exchanges saw minor deviations. Sam Bankman-Fried company Alameda, which borrowed $250,000 USDT from Aave and exchanged it on Curve this morning, may be behind the attack. The address is clearly attributable to Alameda.

Some voices in the crypto community suspect that the strategy is multi-layered and a huge attempt to get everything back in a single trading attempt.

However, a short-term decoupling from the dollar peg is nothing new for Tether and was always a reason for haters spreading rumors. Related Reading: JP Morgan Predicts Bitcoin Crash To $13.000 Due To Cascade Of Margin Calls Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino was quick to dismiss any rumors.

Due to the removal of Alameda/FTX as the main USDT market maker and minter, there may be temporary major deviations. People are not taking any chances and selling USDT for USDC or BUSD, just in case. Alistair Milne, CIO of Altana Digital Currency Fund, commented: Tether has been FUD’ed and attacked longer than FTX has existed. They endured a bigger bank run than FTX and passed with flying colours. Perhaps there’s a different reason they get so much attention while FTX got a pass? Other voices believe that the rumors will not lead to a full, prolonged depeg if Tether is indeed hedged 1:1, as evidenced by the reserves. Even Vitalik Buterin spoke up and defended Tether.

CoinGecko data show that the historical performance of the coin on the daily, weekly, biweekly, and monthly time frames is not promising for the ETH fork. The most noticeable depreciation among these was recorded for the bi-weekly time scale, at a rate of 16.7 percent. If other measures continue to lag, what does the future hold for ETC? Related Reading: These Solana Numbers May Scare Off SOL Investors – Here’s Why ETC Stepping On Green The token has gained 19.35% so far today. While $18.255 provides temporary support for bulls, the regression channel indicates a much stronger slump and so the bulls should not bank on it. At the moment, the highest the price of the coin may go is $22.595, the level where buyers and sellers met during the decline from October 29 to November 3. This ceiling will begin to give way in the coming days as the coin’s relative strength index (RSI) rebounds. Since the price of ETC is highly correlated with the price of ETH, traders and investors in the former should keep an eye on the price of ETH as well. Image: Coinmash This indicates that the price of ETC will closely track that of ETH. There is an indication of a surge in the price of Ether from the $1,099.17 area, where it had been trading at the time of writing, although at the rate the broader crypto market is going, any decent spike may not come soon. In addition to relying on the rising RSI readings, bulls should also consider the positive CMF figures, which signal a change in sentiment. This could counteract the recent decline in ETC’s social influence caused by the FTX insolvency situation. Moreover, social engagements and mentions are increasing, drawing more attention to the coin. Bulls In Charge… For Now Despite the obvious negative decline, the market is partly under the grip of bulls, according to the available technical indicators. As technicals improve, investors and traders should continue to hold ETC for the time being. The EMA ribbon, on the other hand, is bearish and suggests that the coin may be shorted rather than held for the long term. Nonetheless, once the market rebounds from the severe decrease caused by panic, we may expect ETC’s price to closely track that of tETH’s.

USDT usually trades between a hair under $1 and $1.01.  Data from the Kraken, Binance, Coinbase and OKX exchanges show the stablecoin trading in the 97 cents-98 cents range at the four venues. It fell to as low as 93 cents for a few seconds on Kraken.  USDT last reached such price levels during May's implosion of Terra and its related UST stablecoin.  Tether Global Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino pointed out in a Thursday tweet that over 700 million USDT were redeemed for U.S. dollars in the past 24 hours. ""No issues. We keep going,"" he said.  ""During periods of market volatility, the trading price for USDT that is quoted on exchanges may fluctuate. This happens because there is more demand for liquidity than exists on that exchange's order books and has nothing to do with tether's ability to hold its peg nor the value or makeup of its reserves,"" the Tether company said in a statement posted to its website on Wednesday.  USDT transactional activity jumped to a four-month-high, data from Glassnode shows. The metric calculates the average value of all USDT transfers over a given time period, seven days in this case.  A representative for Tether told CoinDesk in an email that issuer Tether Global is unexposed to both Alameda and FTX.  ""We would like to confirm that at this time, Tether has absolutely no credit towards FTX or Alameda Research,"" the external representative said. ""Tether tokens are 100% backed by our reserves, and the assets that are backing the reserves exceed the liabilities.""  USDT prices may deviate from the intended $1 peg, but today's potential depegging comes amid possible contagion risks from the liquidity issues at embattled crypto exchange FTX.  FTX came under scrutiny following a CoinDesk report last week that found the balance sheet of Alameda Research, a crypto trading unit owned by Sam Bankman-Fried, who also owns FTX, was full of FTX’s native FTT tokens. This meant that Alameda rested on a foundation largely made up of a coin that a sister company invented, not an independent asset like a fiat currency or another crypto.

42415024,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBVqHA,1668076927,"EU Lawmakers Vote for Stronger Cyber Protection for Crypto, Other Finance","European Union lawmakers Thursday showed support for strict cybersecurity rules on crypto providers and other financial firms in a 556-18 vote.  The European Commission proposed the bill in 2020 given fears that banks were outsourcing data to the same handful of major, unsupervised cloud computing companies – but the impact it will have on a crypto sector that is plagued by cyberattacks and other exploits remains disputed.  The Digital Operational Resilience Act (Dora) is “a cornerstone of our work on digital finance in the European Union, making sure that we support innovation and do it in a safe way,” European Commissioner Mairead McGuinness said in a Wednesday night debate on the law. “Protecting the financial system from cyber attacks and cyber fraud is vital.”  Financial institutions will have to monitor and report major cyber incidents and test defenses, and the big tech firms offering them services must submit to supervisory oversight, McGuinness said.  The vote formalizes a deal struck between the European Parliament and EU member governments in May. As well as banks and payment firms, it applies to crypto companies such as wallet providers who are set to be regulated under the bloc’s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) and indeed the two laws were originally proposed as a package.  “After the vote on the cryptocurrency legal act and blockchain, this is one more step towards Europe's digital sovereignty,” said centrist French lawmaker Stéphanie Yon-Courtin. “This will protect European investors on the one hand, but it will also prepare financial enterprises against cyber attacks on the other.  In the EU, that could be a significant change for the crypto sector, which may have lost as much as $3 billion in hacks worldwide this year – but some are concerned it comes at the cost of privacy.  “When cryptocurrencies appeared people went there because they thought they would be free from surveillance,” said Ivan Sinčić, who is president of, and only EU lawmaker for, Croatia’s Ključ Hrvatske party. “If we regulate it now we'll have another world where they will be controlled with biometric control … these measures are undermining the idea of cryptocurrencies.”  MiCA itself is set to be voted on by a plenary session of the parliament in February, after suffering delays due to its length and complexity.

It's no surprise, given the fact that the agreement was non-binding , while Binance said the deal was pending due diligence and didn't announce any takeover terms. The two have also been long-time rivals, leading some to speculate that CZ may have just been taking a jab at SBF on his way to the top of the cryptoverse, or checking out the internal state of the rival exchange as concerns bubble about the health of the overall sector. What's next? Sam Bankman-Fried has told investors that FTX would need to file for bankruptcy without a cash injection. The crypto exchange faces a shortfall of up to $8B and needs $4B to remain solvent, and is attempting to raise rescue financing in the form of debt, equity, or a combination of the two (what about crypto?). The De-Fi label is also not stopping the Feds from getting involved, with U.S. Justice Department reportedly looking into the liquidity crisis that sparked FTX's collapse and the SEC analyzing a space Chairman Gary Gensler has previously described as the Wild West. Some say that the cratering crypto environment is spilling over to tech and broader markets, with a correlation between the industries described as shady, real and triggering much of the speculative investment that has occurred over the past few years. A ""cascade of margin calls"" is likely underway in the rest of the crypto ecosystem, according to J.P. Morgan's Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, while ""the number of entities with stronger balance sheets able to rescue those with low capital and high leverage is shrinking."" That could ultimately push the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) down to the $13,000 level. New rescue strategy? ""Further to my announcement to stand behind all Tron token ( TRX-USD ), ( BTT-USD ), #JST, #SUN, ( HT-USD ) holders on #FTX, we are putting together a solution together with #FTX to initiate a pathway forward,"" tweeted Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron cryptocurrency network.

42415033,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBVqxc,1668073661,"Ether, Solana Trade at Premium on FTX – Here Is (Probably) Why","Ethereum's native token, ether (ETH) and Solana's SOL are drawing higher prices on troubled crypto exchange FTX relative to Binance and other platforms. The unusual market dynamic has observers scrambling for an explanation.  At press time, ether traded at a premium of $52 or 4.5% on FTX compared to Binance, data from the charting platform TradingView show. SOL meanwhile traded at a premium of nearly $2 or 11%. A similar premium is seen in FTX-based perpetual futures contracts tied to BTC and ETH.  The premium stems from FTX-based traders switching from cash and cash equivalents (stablecoins) to major cryptocurrencies in the wake of the exchange stopping clients from taking direct custody of their crypto and fiat funds and signaling potential bankruptcy, according to Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport.  ""While FTX pricing might not be in line with other exchanges anymore, traditional bankruptcy procedures always favor the asset holders over the cash holders as assets should be assigned to users. Co-mingled or not,"" Thielen told CoinDesk. ""Hence, users with trapped assets on FTX could be putting their money into major tokens in hopes of receiving some recovery value as their name would / should be assigned to that asset.""  ""That’s why ETH is trading at a premium,"" Thielen said.  In other words, users are more likely to receive some value if they hold crypto assets rather than cash or cash equivalents. And that's probably prompting FTX-based traders to snap up coins, leading to relatively higher prices on the exchange.  FTX's troubles began early this week after Binance moved to liquidate its holdings of the FTX token (FTT) in response to a CoinDesk report showing FTX's sister concern Alameda holding large amounts of illiquid FTT tokens on its balance sheet.  On Tuesday, Binance offered to bail out FTX only to back out of the deal late Wednesday. FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried told investors that without a cash injection, the company may have to file for bankruptcy.  Synthetic withdrawals  Per some observers, the FTX premium in the perpetual markets results from clients executing ""synthetic withdrawals"" from the troubled exchange.  Users are supposedly executing a synthetic or paper withdrawal by purchasing (going long) ETH, SOL perpetual contracts on FTX and selling or shorting an equal amount on Binance, creating a market-neutral or delta-neutral position. That way, users get custody of their funds, at least on paper, and stand protected against an extended price slide.  ""It's a synthetic withdrawal play. The thesis is that if FTX goes down, markets go down and users get paid on their short positions outside FTX even if FTX balance becomes worthless,"" Lewis Harland, portfolio manager at Decentral Partk Capital, told CoinDesk.  Crypto hedge fund Galois Capital, which predicted the Terra turmoil early this year, voiced a similar opinion in a Tweet thread.  ""In the case of the world where the acquisition deal goes through, you are roughly flat (lose a bit on the basis). In the case of the world where the acquisition falls through, the losses on FTX don't matter much because you can't get your money out anyway, but you win on the short Binance leg,"" Galois said.  The assumption here is that a potential FTX bankruptcy will trigger another round of panic selling in the market. And if FTX secures funding, clients will be made whole. However, both things are not promised.  After Binance backed out from a bailout deal, investors may have priced in a potential bankruptcy. And markets may bounce once the bankruptcy is confirmed in a classic ""sell the rumor, buy the fact"" trade, yielding losses on the short trade taken outside FTX.  Further, a trader can get liquidated on both exchanges due to high volatility. Liquidations occur when the market goes against the bullish/bearish position, leading to margin shortage.  According to Galois Capital, the strategy seems the best fit for a token like SOL that would generally do poorly in both deal and no-deal states.  ""Since the current SOL value is the superposition of both the deal and no deal worlds, if it ends up being a deal, SOL should have a short-term rally and if it ends up being no deal, SOL should fall,"" Galois Capital noted.

42415026,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBVqRm,1668072739,David Chaum Rolls Out Privacy-Protecting CBDC Technology,"Will central bank digital currencies (CBDC) replace cash and bank transfers in the future? And will they be an ultimate tool for financial surveillance and control? Or is another, more benign, future possible?  David Chaum, creator of the Bitcoin predecessor eCash and, more recently, the elixxir cryptocurrency, believes the democratic world can have a version of CBDCs that protects privacy. He is working with the Swiss National Bank (SNB) on Project Tourbillon, designed for privacy-focused central bank money.  The project will be developed under the auspices of the Bank of International Settlements’ (BIS) Innovation Hub, the organization announced on Thursday. The project will add to the range of CBDC pilots already in the works by the BIS Innovation Hub, like the projects Helvetia and Mariana – both involving the SNB, too.  The technology underlying the Project Tourbillon will combine privacy preserving functions and quantum-resistant cryptography developed by Chaum, the BIS announcement says. The system will also be scalable as it will be “using an architecture that is compatible with, but not based on, distributed ledger technology,” the press release reads.  The concept, based on Chaum’s blind signature technique, has been outlined in a joint research paper by Chaum and Thomas Moser, alternate member of the SNB governing board.  According to Morten Bech, head of the BIS Innovation Hub Swiss Centre, the project allows to avoid trade-offs between cyber resilience, scalability and user privacy. “Project Tourbillon will build and test a prototype that reconciles these trade-offs and pushes central banks' technological frontier,"" Bech said in the BIS announcement.  The prototype is slated to be completed by mid-2023.  Not like China  According to Chaum, the SNB first approached him last year about his eCash technology and he took it as a chance to prove that a CBDC can be designed in a privacy-protecting fashion. Speaking with CoinDesk in an exclusive interview, he pointed out China as an example of omnipresent digital surveillance by the government. China’s central bank has one of the world’s most advanced CBDC projects, with 100 billion yuan (US$13.9 billion) in transactions already completed.  The U.S. and Europe can do better, Chaum believes. He acknowledges that “CBDCs are a big deal” in the world at the moment and is well aware of the fact that many believe CBDCs will be “the end of privacy in money.”  “It’s incredibly ironic for me that something I’ve been working on 40 years ago has become the actual pivotal distinction between the East and West – privacy in payments,” Chaum said.  “It really becomes a choice: Are we going to have a kind of protection we are entitled to and that distinguishes us as a human rights-based democracy, or we basically are going to have the same thing as in China,” he added.  Chaum says the eCash 2.0 technology he created and described in the paper with SNB’s Moser, is a “superior payment system” with both privacy and anti-counterfeiting protection built into it.  He believes it’s important to show that a CBDC can actually preserve privacy so that no government can say it’s impossible and use it as an excuse to build something similar to the Chinese model.  In another scenario, a government might be willing to maintain privacy in developing its CBDC, but at some point that government can discover that criminals are using those privacy features to conceal illegal activities. That in turn can become a reason to abandon the idea of privacy altogether.  Chaum believes the technology he invented can prevent both scenarios: preventing anyone from tracing how people use their money and, at the same time, allowing the law enforcement to track criminal funds.  How this works in practice is not easy to unpack.  Revocable anonymity  The eCash 2.0 model has two tiers when it comes to issuing central bank digital money: a central bank does it via commercial banks, which onboard users. To get some CBDC on their digital wallets, users need to request it from banks with which they already have accounts. Banks perform know your customer diligence and send a specific authentication code to the central bank so that money can be issued.  Cryptographic mechanics of eCash 2.0 allow central banks to issue those coins to a user without knowing which user exactly owns specific coins, says Mario Yaksetig, the project’s cryptographer. Neither knows the commercial bank that onboarded the user, although both the central and commercial banks know how much money in CBDC a known user received from the system.  A central bank holds a blockchain-based ledger of all the valid coin identifiers, Yaksetig said, so no one can forge new coins, but transactions between wallets are not recorded on a blockchain. “There is no record of transactions whatsoever,” Yaksetig told CoinDesk.  However, users can voluntarily give up the privacy of their coins if they want law enforcement to trace stolen funds. For this, a user would need to reveal his unique cryptographic key to, say, the police, and then the police can see when these stolen coins are being spent at a restaurant, a store or other kind of merchant, because merchants, unlike individual users, would be known to the system. So the police would be able to find where that merchant is, go there and arrest the thieves, Chaum said.  Alternatively, instead of going to the police, a robbed or scammed user might request reissuance of his money using his unique key, Chaum said, so he can spend those coins before the criminals do.  Asked if a government building a CBDC can use what he created to make a system that can be surveilled and censored, making crypto’s worst fears about CBDCs come true, Chaum believes his technology is ill-suited for that.  “There is no way to use it for evil because all it does is protect privacy,” he said. You can opt to use decentralized cryptocurrencies if you wish, but “if you choose to use government-issued money, the government should not be able to see how you spend it,” he added.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/10/david-chaum-rolls-out-privacy-protecting-cbdc-technology,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/486d8cec97b59a736d1b799cc085a11e6d384dd5-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394033,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69buO3fV,1668072601,"UK’s Crypto Future Is Bright No Matter Who’s in Charge, Lawmaker Says","The political turmoil in the U.K. won’t alter crypto’s bright future in the country, lawmaker Lisa Cameron said.  The U.K. has seen its Conservative leadership change hands repeatedly over the last year, prompting support for the Labour Party – the main opposition party – to rise to levels not seen since the late 1990s. Even though voters may choose new leaders in the next election that are now set for 2025 but that could happen sooner, Cameron said in an interview with CoinDesk that she is certain the U.K. will maintain a friendly approach to crypto.  The industry’s concerns over how crypto might be treated under new leadership may stem from comments made by recently appointed Prime Minister Rishi Sunak about his ambitions to turn the country into a hub for crypto.  Sunak, who in October became the third Conservative Party member to take up the position of prime minister in two months, outlined his plans for crypto while he served as finance minister under former Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Members of the local crypto community have viewed Sunak’s appointment as prime minister as a boon to the industry.  But if Parliament succeeded in moving up the 2025 elections through a no-confidence vote on Sunak, the opposition Labour Party could win and potentially throw the Conservative government’s plans to attract crypto businesses to the country off balance. Yet, Cameron, who is a member of Parliament representing the Scottish National Party (SNP), isn’t worried.  Cameron, who is chairwoman of the All Parliamentary Group for Crypto and Digital Assets (APPG), a forum of lawmakers, said she is sure that crypto will remain a nonpartisan issue no matter who runs the government.  “I do think from a working-cross party, that people are gradually realizing in all the parties, so that no matter who is in government now or in the future, that [crypto] is an area of innovation, technology and of real dynamism for the future,” Cameron said.  Progress despite the turbulence  The political turbulence so far has had little effect on the crypto policies that are in the works. The Financial Services and Markets bill, which would bring digital assets under the scope of financial regulators, and the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency bill, which would help authorities recover crypto linked to criminal activity, are still making progress despite the high-profile entrance and exit of former Prime Minister Liz Truss.  U.K. leaders are even more sympathetic toward the technologies that underlie crypto. Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor of the Bank of England, has said distributed ledger technology could be used in settling trades of traditional assets. Meanwhile, Lords, who are members of the upper branch of Parliament, have introduced a bill that could enable trade documents to be stored on a blockchain.  The Labour Party, however, might have a more skeptical view of crypto. “Many are rightly questioning whether crypto has a future at all,” Labour Party Treasury spokeswoman Abena Oppong-Asare said during a debate in Parliament in September.  Although the government is ushering in new legislation for crypto, much of what happens to the burgeoning sector depends on the Financial Conduct Authority. Crypto firms must register with the FCA to operate in the U.K., and depending on legislation, the FCA, which is known for being critical of crypto, could end up with the power to determine how crypto firms can advertise and reach out to U.K. clients.  Read more: UK Lawmakers Vote to Recognize Crypto as Regulated Financial Instruments  Cross-party debate  Cameron’s APPG group, which was formed in December 2021, already has representatives from the Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democratic and SNP parties shaping the crypto debate.  “Actually my job is to almost engage everybody and make sure that this is apolitical so that we have our framework going forward and, yes, different governments will want to put their own mark on it or their own stamp on it moving forward,” Cameron said. “But then, we have underpinning that, a group of parliamentarians right across all the parties who can discuss it, debate it and inform whichever strategy goes ahead.”  The APPG will also be releasing its first inquiry report, which will consider whether the U.K. government’s vision to make the country a crypto hub is an achievable goal. The report will look at the “components of that vision, how achievable it is and what we need to put in place,” Cameron said. The report is scheduled to be published in January.  Read more: UK Parliamentary Group Starts Crypto Inquiry to Form Policy Recommendations  On the ‘Hunt’  The future of the country's plans for a crypto hub rests partly in the hands of the seemingly crypto-friendly Sunak as well as with new Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt. The Treasury department Hunt oversees ushered in new stablecoin proposals in July.  Hunt hasn’t expressed any views on crypto in public, but Cameron, who served on the health committee while Hunt was health minister between 2012 and 2018, said she “knows Jeremy very well.”  “He [Hunt] likes to be on the ball with things. He looks at detail, he is someone who puts time in to methodically examine areas, and I think that's a good thing moving forward for this sector,” Cameron said. “And I would say that he's also someone who's interested in and understands the capacity and capability of digital transformation.”  Read more: UK Stablecoin Rules Approved by Lawmaker Committee",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/10/uks-crypto-future-is-bright-no-matter-whos-in-charge-lawmaker-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/842a97ef4bcfd076c9ce1c36d29d5c47bbfe6be7-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Tron-based assets such as BTT, SUN and JST rocketed higher as well, trading for several multiples on FTX in contrast to other bourses.  It’s not a result of repetitive fat finger trades, nor have FTX traders gone euphoric on TRX.  The high prices are a sign of hope – a hope that Tron-based assets will be redeemed on a 1:1 basis by Tron founder Justin Sun. Traders on FTX, at the time of writing, cannot withdraw any assets from FTX, and trading accounts are selling for pennies on the dollar.  But TRX could be a way out for some crypto hopefuls.  Earlier during the day, Sun offered a “way forward” for FTX – which receded into insolvency following the aftermath of a CoinDesk report – stating that the ongoing liquidity crunch was “harmful to the industry development and investors alike.”  Binance founder Changpeng Zhao was earlier the frontrunner to take over FTX, but that deal fell apart after scrutiny of FTX’s books.

Sun’s play is to attract, and honor, Tron-based assets like BTT and SUN, as well as Huobi’s native HT tokens, stemming from FTX. The move allows for large traders to liquidate some of their holdings while improving sentiment for the Tron ecosystem.  The sentiment was quick to improve. The trading of TRX, and related assets, was restarted on FTX in Asian hours on Thursday, moving prices to over $2.50. Prices corrected to 32 cents as of writing time – hours after Sun’s tweet – and still trade at a 400% premium compared to other exchanges.",POSITIVE,TRX | BTT,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | TRX | BTT,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/10/trx-momentarily-surges-4000-on-ftx-as-justin-sun-emerges-as-latest-would-be-ftx-savior,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5975c5cc373102007bdcd5e23efaa5d04db3009-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BTC’s price continues to look bearish with the market’s current state, as things look uncertain for most traders and investors. BTC’s price remains weak across all timeframes as the price trades slightly below the 50 and 200 Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). In the last two days, the crypto market has been erratic, with the price of many altcoins, including Bitcoin (BTC), battling for survival after the news came out that Binance would not be taking over FTX after conducting due diligence. Previous weeks saw the price of Bitcoin (BTC) perform well, rallying from a low of $19,200 to a high of $21,800. Most altcoins trend higher as many produced gains of over 200%, including DOGE rallying from a region of $0.55 to a high of $0.15, with many hoping for more recovery bounce. Still, these expectations were cut short by the uncertainty surrounding the crypto market. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Plunges 15%, Can Buyers Save The Key $15K Support? Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The previous week saw many altcoins produced over 200% gains over the past 7 days of breaking out of their range-bound movement, as many believe more hope is returning to the crypto space. The new week has yet to look like the previous as the week has looked choked with FUD (Fear of uncertainty and doubt), leading to many altcoins being affected negatively in price as major coins have been struggling to stay afloat from what looks like a crypto purge. The news of Binance rescuing the situation by taking over FTX was good. Still, after conducting their due diligence, Binance decided it would not take over FTX as this has affected the market negatively, sending the price of BTC on a spiral movement to $15,700 after losing its all-time support of 2017 at $18,500. The price of BTC has continued to look bearish after breaking below its all-time high support, which has served as support as a good demand zone for major plays holding off sell-offs. According to speculations, there are more chances of the price revisiting $14,000. Weekly resistance for the price of BTC – $17,500. Weekly support for the price of BTC – $15,500. Price Analysis Of BTC On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of BTC remains considerably weak in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $15,500 support after bouncing off that region to a high of $16,600, holding off the price from trending lower. If the price of BTC breaks below the temporary support formed at $15,500, we could see the price of BTC trading to a region of $14,000. Daily resistance for the BTC price – $17,000.

Given FTX’s exposure to the token and the fact that they hold a sizable position, it has suffered a massive decline in tandem with the FTT token. The token has already lost more than 50% of its value since the weekend. However, the bloodbath may not be over for SOL holders as some developments come to light. More Solana Being Unlocked Even with the market already being oversaturated with sell-offs, there is more SOL scheduled to be put into circulation.

With so many shorting the market and SOL prices expected to fall lower, it is likely that the owner of these tokens would sell their tokens instead of staking them once more. The impact of this unlock could be catastrophic for the price of the digital asset. Think single-digit SOL prices for the first time in more than a year.

If FTX does file for bankruptcy, the contagion could be massive. As Bitcoinist reported today, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried confirmed in a call with his investors shortly before Binance dismissed his bailout that the hole in the balance sheet is $8 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Plunges 15%, Can Buyers Save The Key $15K Support? An anonymous source leaked that the troubled exchange is seeking bailout funding in the form of debt, equity or a combination of both. With Singaporean state-owned Temasak and TRON founder Justin Sun, there are currently at least two small sparks of hope. JP Morgan Forecasts Gloomy Times For Bitcoin The looming insolvency of FTX continues to weigh heavily on the Bitcoin price at the moment. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $17,767, down 9% over the last 24 hours and down 19% over the last seven days. Exactly one year ago, on November 10, 2021, BTC reached its previous all-time high of $69,045.00, which represents a price drop of around 75% at the current rate. However, according to the latest report from JP Morgan, it could go even lower as the market faces a “cascade of margin calls.” According to JPMorgan strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the Bitcoin price could fall as low as $13,000. Moreover, the analysts warn in the report that the cascade effect could be amplified due to the current conditions of the market: What makes this new phase of crypto deleveraging induced by the apparent collapse of Alameda Research and FTX more problematic is that the number of entities with stronger balance sheets able to rescue those with low capital and high leverage is shrinking” in the crypto sphere. According to JP Morgan, a renewed miner capitulation deems a major risk factor. In particular, the U.S. banking giant believes Bitcoin could fall below its production cost, currently averaging around $15,000. At the moment, this production cost stands at $15,000, but it is likely to revisit the $13,000 low seen over the summer months. As a result, more miners like Core Scientific recently may be forced to sell their Bitcoin holdings, putting additional selling pressure on the market. Riot Blockchain, one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners, recently released its latest quarterly report, revealing the state of its finances and operations.

42415018,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBVpqd,1668062227,Crypto Execs Ask for Clearer US Regulatory Policy After FTX Collapse,"The CEOs of Coinbase (COIN), Ripple and Circle said that a lack of a clear framework from regulators was the reason why most of the crypto trading in the U.S. occurs on offshore exchanges – like the now-struggling FTX.  Replying to a tweet by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said that FTX was not registered in the U.S. Armstrong added that a lack of clarity from the Securities and Exchange Commission is the reason most U.S. trading activity occurred offshore.  Backing Armstrong, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse pointed to the regulatory framework in Singapore as an example.  ""Brian is right – to protect consumers, we need regulatory guidance for companies that ensures trust and transparency. There's a reason why most crypto trading is offshore – companies have 0 guidance on how to comply here in the US,"" Garlinghouse said.  ""Compare that with Singapore which has a licensing framework, token taxonomy laid out, and much more. They can appropriately regulate crypto b/c they've done the work to define what 'good' looks like, and know all tokens aren’t securities (despite what Chair Gensler insists),"" he added.  Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire also backed Armstrong and added that lack of a proper regulatory framework in the U.S. has left users exposed to the overseas supervisory structure.  In a separate thread Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell echoed the opinions of his peers.  ""U.S. lawmakers and regulators have some accountability too.

The discount in GBTC shares relative to the value of the underlying asset held in the fund widened to a record 36.7% on Nov. 7. Bitcoin has dropped by nearly 20% during the past two weeks as the bear market shows its ugly claws.  Analysts say that a continued widening of the GBTC discount shows a weakening institutional demand for bitcoin, combined with the ready availability of bitcoin exchange-traded funds for retail.  In a note to CoinDesk, Henry Liu, CEO of BTSE, a trading infrastructure provider, said that the GBTC discount hitting such extreme levels is because of the liquidity crunch post FTX's collapse.  ""This has resulted in thinning liquidity, wider spreads, and increasing volatility across the industry, particularly for BTC,"" Liu said.  GBTC is a close-ended fund, meaning BTC deposits are perpetually locked, but GBTC shares can be sold on the market after a six-month lockup.  In June, Grayscale launched a suit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which denied the company’s application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an exchange-traded fund.

42415031,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBVqsJ,1668058046,Panic Grips SOL With Record Volatility and Massive Put Demand,"The long-awaited crypto volatility explosion has arrived and it is signaling panic for Solana's SOL token.  SOL's seven-day implied volatility, a measure of expected price turbulence in the short term, has skyrocketed to an annualized 270% – twice as high as bitcoin's 135%, according to digital assets data provider Amberdata. SOL's 30-day implied volatility has surged to 190% versus bitcoin's 95%.  SOL's seven-day call-put skew has dropped to a lifetime low of -99%, a sign of record demand for bearish puts relative to bullish calls. Investors typically buy puts when anticipating a price slide.  ""There is panic in the SOL market,"" Gregoire Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said, noting the spike in implied volatility.  ""Traders are nervous about the value of SOL and the potential for massive liquidations. SOL is a collateral asset, it's likely to get liquidated as FTX/Alameda needs to raise cash... Therefore, the options market is pricing more volatility in SOL vs. BTC,"" Magadini added.  Rumors of troubled exchange FTX's sister concern Alameda liquidating its Solana holdings has already sent SOL into a freefall. The token has dropped 58% to nearly $10 in four days, according to CoinDesk data.  Additionally, an incoming supply deluge seems to have spooked investors in both the spot and derivatives markets.  Solana validators who provide security to the blockchain are set to unlock nearly $800 million worth of their SOL holdings in a few hours, amounting to 5.4% of the cryptocurrency's total supply.  Further, there could be continued token emissions over the short term, keeping supply-side pressures strong.  ""In addition to continued withdrawal of SOL from validators, our emissions and unlock tracking for the token flagged an upcoming core team allocation vesting in 11 days. This unlock represents 2,558,000 SOL coming to market. Emissions will continue at their standard rate of 68,493 SOL/day,"" The TIE Research said in a note on Wednesday.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Rallies, but Still Lumbers Near Two-Month Lows  by James Rubin  A sad Wednesday for cryptocurrencies seemed to get sadder by the minute before bitcoin and a number of leading altcoins by market capitalization staged a small rally.  As Asian markets opened, BTC was trading at about $16,200, down nearly 11% over the previous 24 hours, but a marked improvement from earlier in the day when it seemed headed toward $15,000. The decline continued bitcoin's downward trend this week following the rapid unraveling of crypto exchange giant FTX, which suffered a liquidity crisis and was then jilted by would-be rescuer Binance.  Ether followed a similar pattern, tumbling below $1,100 for the first time since mid-summer before regaining a small swathe of lost ground. The second-largest crypto in market value was recently changing hands at about $1,140, off more than 12% from Tuesday, same time. ETH had been hovering over $1,500 for the past two weeks.  Other major cryptocurrencies continued to plunge for a third consecutive day as investors fretted over every development in an industry already rocked by calamities involving crypto giants Terraform Labs, Three Arrows Capital and Celsius Network.  FTX’s FTT token recently dropped almost 55% a day after plummeting about 80% and was trading at just $2.34. The Solana platform’s SOL token recently fell almost 40% to continue its downward momentum of recent days. Last week, CoinDesk reported that a copy of FTX sister company Alameda's balance sheet showed the firm held $292 million of “unlocked SOL,” $863 million of “locked SOL” and $41 million of “SOL collateral.” Even Binance’s BNB token was down about 15% after outperforming most other cryptos on Tuesday.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market, was down 3%.  A day after U.S. midterm elections, stocks saw their first red of the week, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropping 2.4% and 2%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was off 1.9%. Safe haven gold ticked down slightly.  In an email, Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote that the FTX debacle and its much-admired CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, has shaken an industry often criticized for its lack of guardrails.  “Sam Bankman-Fried was supposed to be bulletproof,” Moya wrote. “SBF was crypto’s ‘white knight’ and the implosion of FTX means no one is safe. The stabilization period for crypto is over and now we wait to see if other contagion risks emerge.”  Moya added: ""Cryptos are under intense pressure as contagion risks remain elevated from the FTX liquidity crisis. No one wants to touch anything that has ties with FTX and that is troubling news.""  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.

Crypto exchanges are now scrambling to publicly publish their fund reserves. On Wednesday alone, nine exchanges – Binance, Gate.io, KuCoin, Poloniex, Bitget, Huobi, OKX, Deribit and Bybit – separately issued statements that they would publish their Merkle tree reserve certificates to increase transparency.  Publishing proofs can take one month, but OKX Director of Finan to publish results, BitMEX opted for a simpler way: “All BitMEX has done here is publish a basic list of the reserves. The list contains all the bitcoin we have under our custody on behalf of our clients, it is as simple as that,” the exchange said in a Wednesday post.  While most exchanges said they would use Merkle tree processing to publish results, BitMEX opted fora simpler way: “All BitMEX has done here is publish a basic list of the reserves. The list contains all the Bitcoin we have under our custody on behalf of our clients, it is as simple as that,” the exchange said in a Wednesday post. (The list of BitMEX’s custodied assets is available here.)  The list contains the execution scripts for each user transaction under custody, which in turn include BitMEX public keys. “This, therefore, proves that the company is able to access all the funds, assuming the company has access to the private keys associated with the public keys,” BitMEX said.  At one point on Nov. 8, BitMEX held a reserve bitcoin balance of 75,742.4 BTC against liabilities of 75,617.1 BTC, meaning it holds assets in excess of what it owes to customers.  The proof-of-reserves preceded Friday’s initial listing of BMEX tokens, BitMEX’s native token. The exchange initially announced the token in 2021, as CoinDesk reported, before airdropping BMEX to users based on their activity. The tokens were supposed to be offered for trading in July, but those plans were dropped amid faltering “market conditions.”  For some crypto market observers, the decision by BitMEX, which has historically focused on derivative trading, was a means for the exchange to remain relevant.  “BitMEX ‘degens’ and the ‘trollbox’ were mainstays of the Wild West world of crypto trading before newer exchanges launched and gained relevance after 2017,“ said Tim Behrsin, founder of crypto project Grexie, in a Telegram chat.  “BitMEX issuing tokens is how the exchange remains relevant among new crypto traders spoilt by choice by rival exchanges that offer interest-accruing exchange tokens and discounts based on tokens held.

In a note to Limited Partners posted on the firm’s Twitter page, Sequoia said the exposure it has to FTX is limited, and whatever money it has lost has been offset by billions of dollars in gains.  Sequoia said that it has invested $150 million into FTX.com and FTX.us via its Global Growth III fund and $63.5 million into the exchange and its U.S. division via its SCGE Fund. These investments represent 3% of the Global Growth III fund and less than 1% of the SCGE fund.  “The $150 million loss is offset by the approximately $7.5 billion in realized and unrealized gains in the same fund, so the fund remains in good shape,” Sequoia wrote in a note.  The VC fund noted that in 2021, when it made the investments, FTX generated $1 billion in revenue and $250 million in operating income.

On Tuesday, FTT, the FTX native token, went to ruins with over 73% decline. It happened after the exchange liquidated its Ethereum holdings to mitigate its insolvency crisis. Before the crisis became known, the CEO of FTX, Bankman-Fried, debunked rumors of the firm’s financial pressure. He said the firm’s asset remains okay, and there was no threat of insolvency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bloodbath Takes Crypto To New Bear Market Lows | BTCUSD November 8, 2022 However, yesterday, Bankman-Fried went on Twitter to reveal FTX’s financial ordeal. He pleaded with Binance to assist them in navigating through the overwhelming withdrawal requests. Binance CEO CZ later announced that Binance would acquire the embattled crypto exchange. However, today, the CEO announced again, stating that the supposed acquisition was not a planned decision. He noted that acquiring FTX is not good for any crypto firm, hence not a win for Binance. FTX Crash Would Increase Scrutiny On Crypto Exchanges By Regulators Despite Binance’s previous ties with FTX, the move for its acquisition was rather sudden. According to Changpeng Zhao, he talked with Bankman-Fried in less than 24 hours leading to news of the FTX acquisition. The Binance CEO explained that FTX’s fallout would place the crypto space on regulators’ radar. Furthermore, CZ said the difficulty in obtaining a license in the global crypto market would increase. He emphasized the need for transparency about company assets and reserves. Changpeng Zhao’s advice is in line with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s advice for public audit and transparency in the industry. Further in his statement, CZ placed importance on product quality. Given the current market condition, he encouraged his employees to focus on creating valued products for users instead of asset prices. Despite FTX’s liquidity issues and concerns about how it could affect potential buyers, CZ revealed plans for fully acquiring the crypto exchange. The CEO acknowledged that the crypto exchange is in a serious liquidity crisis, and the acquisition is a form of assistance to cover FTX’s debts. Peep Into Market After FTT Crash The news of FTX’s crash saw the crypto market in massive loss as assets’ prices dropped, with an overall 10% decline.

The vote of confidence came after a bloody, 24-hour drawdown in crypto markets in which SOL shed over 40% of its value and Helium’s HNT lost 15%. Haleem, CEO of Helium backer Nova Labs, said he was unfazed by the bear market carnage and pledged to continue apace.  Helium is a crypto-powered wireless hotspot network that until recently operated atop its own blockchain. The move to Solana will see it integrate with that far larger network’s big tech gambits, including Solana’s crypto-centric cellphone.

42415027,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBVqhh,1668044223,Tron Network USDD Stablecoin Wobbles From Dollar Peg Amid Latest Crypto Crisis,"The Tron network's algorithmic stablecoin decentralized USD (USDD), championed by Tron founder Justin Sun, dropped from its $1 anchor as the implosion of the prominent crypto exchange FTX shook investors' confidence in broader crypto markets.  USDD fell to as low as below 97 cents on multiple crypto exchanges Wednesday after it deviated from a supposed 1:1 exchange rate with the U.S. dollar a day before.  The USDD liquidity pool on the decentralized finance protocol Curve, where users can trade USDD for other stablecoins such as USDT, USDC and DAI, is heavily imbalanced, with USDD accounting for almost 80% of assets in the pool. This imbalance suggests that more investors want to sell USDD than buy, putting downward pressure on USDD's price. The USDD exchange rate for other stablecoins was most recently around 98.5 cents.  Sun speculated in a tweet that Alameda Research, the liquidity-strapped trading firm and sister company of struggling crypto exchange FTX, might have sold its USDD holdings, kick-starting the stablecoin's deviation from the peg.  A Tron spokesperson told CoinDesk they don't consider the recent decline a depeg, as Tron DAO set the acceptable level of fluctuation in USDD's price to 3% under extremely volatile market conditions.  USDD is the native stablecoin of the Tron blockchain with a $725 million market capitalization. It is designed to keep its price stable at $1, supported by a combination of trading incentives and the storage of more crypto assets in the Tron DAO Reserve than USDD's total value. It was started in May, around the time Terra network's USTC stablecoin lost its dollar peg, igniting a full-blown crisis in the broader digital asset market.  Stablecoin prices depegging from their supposed exchange rate is a tell-tale sign of a liquidity crisis in the crypto market. In May and June, several stablecoins lost their pegs while crypto firms such as Three Arrows Capital, Voyager Digital and Celsius Network faced insolvencies. USDD also dropped to 96 cents in June, according to data on cryptocurrency price tracker CoinGecko.",NEGATIVE,USDD,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | USDD,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/10/tron-network-usdd-stablecoin-wobbles-from-dollar-peg-amid-latest-crypto-crisis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5975c5cc373102007bdcd5e23efaa5d04db3009-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
