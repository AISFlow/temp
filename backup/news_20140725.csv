42425933,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh6rh,1406324209,Huobi: Regulated US Bitcoin Market Key to Our Expansion,"Known as one of China's 'big three' exchanges, Beijing-based Huobi experienced a meteoric rise to the top tier of China's bitcoin industry last year, emerging as newcomer and growing to become a market leader with more than 100 employees.  Since that early success, Huobi, like other China-based exchanges, has struggled to control its international perception.  Huobi has had to fight off rumours it was faking trading volumes in a bid to attract users. Further, the future and stability of its business were called into question by China's central bank, which has moved broadly to discourage bitcoin businesses from working with its financial services sector in March.  It's this uncertain image that Huobi is looking to attack as it, like major competitors OKCoin and BTC China, begins to set its sights overseas.  In accordance with these global goals, the company's international business director Wendy Wang spoke at The North American Bitcoin Conference last weekend. There, CoinDesk sat down with Wang for an extended interview where she suggested Huobi will soon add support for USD markets in a bid to attract new users both in China and around the globe.  Wang told CoinDesk:  ""You can imagine how much money Chinese consumers hold in USD [...] We're looking at the whole picture. Our actual competitors are BTC-e, Bitstamp and Bitfinex, all of those platforms. We want to be the international standard.""  To meet this goal, Wang said Huobi is investing heavily in AML and KYC compliance and overall security. But, she added: ""We have a lot of homework to do.""  Huobi is the second-largest bitcoin exchange in China by volume, trailing rival OKCoin.  International ambitions  Of course, Wang also offered her thoughts on what exactly it means for a bitcoin exchange to be international, especially given the fact that Huobi, as most exchanges, does already serve customers outside of its home country.  To Wang, being an international exchange means growing the business and its ambitions. Throughout the discussion, she emphasized the professional abilities of her team, noting Huobi's strong legal, accounting, marketing and compliance divisions.  Shifting the team's focus globally will mean a reallocation of some of its team to address this issue, Wang said:  ""We're still trying to weigh how to change or what is the right way to change. We definitely want to go international, but who is to tell us the standards of being international? It's a long and hard way to find a standard to running a proper business in the bitcoin industry.""  She added: ""We're trying really hard, but it's complicated and hard to say if we're there.""  Managing perception  Like OKCoin's Changpeng Zhao, Wang is confident that Huobi's product will meet the needs of global consumers. In particular, she notes that she feels the exchange has the best liquidity and that it now offers novel features such as margin trading and interest accounts via its new platform BitVC.  However, Huobi faces a language barrier, one that it is still working to overcome, as evidenced by Wang's lukewarm reception from conference-goers at TNABC.  Still, she is optimistic that Huobi can reach these customers through dialogue, and that its persistent approach will pay dividends, saying:  ""For the international users, we changed all the interface, we learned a lot of things from other trading platforms, and we have our main customers we can talk to and give feedback. So, we are trying to get a heads up about what our foreign customers really like.""  Uncertainty in China  Given the uncertainty regarding whether China will even allow Huobi and its competitors' operations to continue, it remains unclear whether Huobi itself and its competitors will need to focus internationally out of necessity. Early this year, its announcements suggested it was one of the exchanges more willing to adapt to survive.  Wang indicated that Huobi is interested in other Asian markets, and that it could seek to set up a regulated exchange in Singapore or Japan in part to reduce this risk.  However, with formal guidance from Chinese regulators unlikely, she suggested that the biggest focus for her company is on the US and wider USD market, stating:  ""Everyone is looking at the US market, but we're waiting on the regulation coming up. All the exchanges will start doing something at this point.""  Wang went on to say that Huobi is still evaluating the measures put forth in New York, and that though they don't necessarily support those proposals, firm guidance on how to operate in the market would be beneficial, adding:  ""As long as the government defines [bitcoin] and actually regulates it, you can follow up and we can actually make movements according to the law.""  She also named Europe and Australia as other markets of interest to the exchange.  Cooperative culture  While both Huobi and OKCoin have their sights set on becoming the top global exchange, Wang said that the atmosphere between the companies remains friendly, especially as the major companies are grappling with issues – whether regulation or international exchange – simultaneously.  ""Most of the CEOs here sit together and talk about future of bitcoin and chinese bitcoin exchanges what we're going to do internationally,"" she said.  As for now, she wouldn't say when Huobi would make its formal introduction to the international market, suggesting that her company wants to ensure its strategy is fully in place before any moves are made.  As Wang asserts, confidence is king in the international market, and she is keen to ensure that Huobi moves lightly as it tries to secure new users.  She concluded:  ""The way we do business is honest and professional and we do what we say. It's going to take time for users to trust our brand. Saying is always easier than doing. What we want to present is our action.""  Correction: Additional comment has been added to clarify Huobi's position on US regulation and the NYDFS proposals. An original version of this article referred to Huobi's Wendy Wang as Wendy Wen.

42425921,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh6Xh,1406312744,Kanye West Sues Coinye Altcoin into Oblivion,"Rapper Kanye West has managed to kill an altcoin named in his honour, six months after it was launched by a team of developers.  Called Coinye West, the altcoin was subsequently renamed Coinye in an attempt to continue its business activities even in the face of legal pressure.  The developers envisioned Coinye as a fun and simple altcoin for the hip-hop community, and even tweeted news about its development to the rapper in the hopes he would embrace the concept.  This plan backfired, however, as Kanye West sued the Coinye team on 8th January, starting a lengthy legal process that has been ongoing since this time. The resulting legal onslaught even caused the closure of one exchange involved with the coin's planned launch.  Originally announced on 3rd January and arriving shortly after the meme-based dogecoin, Coinye arguably arrived at the height of the altcoin industry's more irreverent phase.  Despite the legal challenges, the coin maintains an active Bitcoin Talk thread and reportedly still trades on some exchanges under the ticker symbols COYE or KOI.  Thou shall not mock Kanye  The altcoin met its end at a New York courthouse earlier this week when the 10 defendants lost by default, never bothering to respond to the case, according to Ars Technica.  Three of the defendants, David McEnery, Harry Wills and Richard McCord settled with West. Under the terms of the settlement they are permanently banned from operating or using any website that features the ""Kanye West mark"" or any imitation of it.  McCord's lawyer said he was not even involved in the creation of the parody altcoin.  He added that it is ""unfortunate that a parody turned into such an expensive endeavor"", and that he views the whole process as a learning experience.  Parody taken to court  It took Kanye less than a week to unleash his lawyers against the creators of Coinye. The developers responded by changing the visual appearance of the coin and their homepage. The redesigned coin featured an even less flattering portrayal of West, depicted as a fish, inspired by a South Park parody of West.  The developers eventually decided to kill the project altogether, but not before Kanye's lawyers tried to drag them and anyone involved with the project to court.  Robbie E.C.A. Hontele  , who has denied any involvement with the coin's development, but was an admitted user of the coin, has since signed a settlement agreement. Hontele was reportedly misnamed as one of the coin's developers in a video, thus causing his involvement.  Hontele told Ars:  “I'm happy to see the blockchain is not mentioned in the verdict and that the settlement has been made without any admission of wrongdoing.""  He concluded: ""I will be celebrating tonight.""",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/25/kanye-west-sues-coinye-altcoin-into-oblivion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5cc7d75b6b3c19429faec1f5b6b08495a2ad6fd7-1250x833.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425936,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh6th,1406308250,Celery Launches Consumer-Friendly Bitcoin and Dogecoin Buying Service,"Multi-exchange trading platform provider BTX Trader has officially launched Celery, a new product that aims to position the company to expand its market beyond institutional traders to everyday US consumers.  Celery will offer bitcoin and dogecoin buying, boasting what the company says is a more carefully calibrated user experience than what has been provided by other digital currency exchanges and brokerages to date.  BTX Trader CTO Divya Thakur and COO Ilya Subkhankulov expanded on this idea of user experience in an interview with CoinDesk, saying:  ""We tested [Celery] with users and watched them use the product. So, we feel that our onboarding and our user experience is superior to any other solutions out there, when it comes to a first time buyer of bitcoin or dogecoin.""  Thakur explained that many of the consumers BTX Trader worked with were unaware that they could buy fractions of a bitcoin, an insight that lead the service to include preset buying options.  Consumers can elect to purchase 'Packages' to buy $19.99, $49.99 and $99.99 worth of bitcoin or dogecoin, or use the 'Custom' version of the interface, which may be more familiar to existing traders. Celery does not support credit card buying.  Further, Celery includes social features, allowing those who purchase bitcoin or dogecoin to share the message to others. To encourage customer confidence, these messages are then aggregated on the main page.  BTX Trader is a subsidiary of WPCS International, a public company that specializes in product integration, speciality construction and electrical power.  Opening a Celery account  To begin, Celery requests basic user information including the user's first name, last name, email and country of residence.  Next, it asks that users add their mobile phone number, address and bank account information. At each stage, the company provides a short explanation of why such information is needed, another feature clearly aimed at novice buyers.  The 'Add a phone' option, for instance, reads:  ""Please provide your mobile phone number to enable Two-Factor Authentication, a security feature that sends SMS codes to your phone to better protect your account. We will not contact you by phone unless absolutely necessary.""  Elsewhere, Celery builds in basic definitions for its services. When users seek to deposit digital currency, they are greeted with an introductory explanation of how an address works.  Support for altcoins  Thakur also told CoinDesk that Celery aims to be digital currency inclusive, a stance that it has first presented in its support for dogecoin.  He added that he believes dogecoin's strong community was its most attractive feature:  ""We think dogecoin is a great community. It's used in sites like reddit, it's much higher volume than bitcoin tipping and there's really no good hosted wallet for dogecoin.""  With the move, Celery joins expresscoin to become the latest novice digital currency service to also court dogecoin buyers.  The perks of being public  Thakur and Subkhankulov also talked about their relationship with WPCS, which funded BTX Trader with a $1m investment earlier this year.  Thakur indicated that while they do seek insight from the company's CEO Sebastian Giordano, they are free to innovate as they see fit, saying:  ""The way that really works is that we were on a call with them talking about our direction. They really keep us as a domain expert when it comes to digital currency.""  To learn more about Celery, visit its newly launched website.

42425914,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh6Lh,1406296135,AirBaltic Waives Controversial Bitcoin Transaction Fee,"UPDATE (16:55 BST 25th July): Updated with comment from BitPay.      Latvian airline airBaltic has decided to eliminate its controversial transaction charge on bitcoin purchases.  Earlier this week, the firm became the first European airline to accept bitcoin for flight bookings. The news was covered by digital currency news outlets and even some mainstream media, putting Latvia firmly on the cryptocurrency map.  However, enthusiasm soon waned after it emerged that the airline was still charging its standard €5.99 fee on bitcoin transactions – the same as customers paying with a credit card.    Prompt u-turn  The airline originally responded to the criticism by explaining that the transaction fee is actually used to cover the cost of processing bookings rather than the transactions themselves.  However, many in the bitcoin community felt the airline was missing the whole point of accepting bitcoin, which offers tiny or no transaction fees.  It did not take long for airBaltic to review its policies – in the face of cryptocurrency community discontent, perhaps – and the airline has now waived transaction fees on bitcoin payments altogether.  The update could have gone unnoticed had it not been for BitPay, which tweeted the news last night:    Hooray! @airBaltic now makes it free to pay with #bitcoinpic.twitter.com/XqzdEVJWht      — BitPay (@BitPay) July 24, 2014    Stephanie Wargo, BitPay's VP of Marketing told CoinDesk:  ""Part of our mission is to help educate merchants on bitcoins and in working with airBaltic we pointed out that fees for bitcoin payment processing are substantially lower than credit cards and other forms of payment. As a result they dropped any fees for paying with bitcoin and pass those savings on to the consumer.""  CoinDesk has reached out to airBaltic for comment, but has not yet received a reply.  Travelling with bitcoin  Although airBaltic is the first airline to accept bitcoin, there are already a number of ways to spend bitcoin in the travel industry and to some extent in the hospitality industry.    Expedia began accepting bitcoin for hotel bookings last month, but it has not yet started accepting bitcoin for flight bookings. The company recently told CoinDesk that the response to its bitcoin push has been better than anticipated, but it stopped short of disclosing any figures.    As far as flight bookings go, CheapAir started accepting bitcoin last year. CheapAir has since expanded its services to 200,000 partner hotels and railway offerings, and recently announced it has topped $1.5m in total bitcoin sales.

42425915,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh6Rh,1406290179,OKCoin Denies Manipulating Bitcoin Trading Volumes,"The issue of trade volume authenticity on Chinese exchanges has surfaced again, with one user accusing the country's busiest exchange OKCoin of manipulating volumes after bitcoin statistics sites displayed a sharp drop in a short period.  Chinese exchanges including OKCoin have been accused in the past of artificially inflating their trade volumes and even influencing prices by using in-house software 'trading bots'. The exchanges have always categorically denied this, saying high volumes are the result of their low (or absent) trading fees.  Sudden decline in volume  Reddit user 'circle2011' noted yesterday that OKCoin's CNY/BTC volumes had gone from around 115,000 BTC on 1st July to 11,000 by 12th July before all trade data disappeared from the graph on Bitcoin Charts.  Circle2011 even suggested OKCoin's new chief technology officer, Changpeng Zhao, might have put a stop to OKCoin's automated trading now the exchange was trying to appeal to a more international audience and is coming under greater scrutiny.  OKCoin has experienced large volume spikes previously, topping 280,000 BTC three times between February and April. The 11,000 figure on 12th July was, however, the lowest daily volume in the past six months.  OKCoin.com's volume was 37,153 BTC on 24th July and 27,228 BTC on 25th July.  Reliability of trade data  OKCoin's manager of foreign operations, Zane Tackett, responded to the poster's claims, saying no OKCoin data had appeared on either Bitcoin Charts or Bitcoinity in recent weeks because those sites were trying to pull data from the international OKCoin.com site (which has not been officially launched), instead of its main OKCoin.cn site.  Tackett said the full international exchange would be up and running ""within 12 hours"".  Just last month, OKCoin released a raft of new algorithmic trading tools with the specific aim of attracting high-volume traders, particularly those located outside mainland China.  Exchange denies manipulation  Zhao himself also responded to the reddit claims, writing:  ""On the topic of volume, please understand a couple things. We, the exchange, do not control volume. It is what it is.""  He also pointed out that OKCoin does not set the BTC price, adding this was ""a bit more obvious, but you would be surprised how many times I get asked"".  ""When the price is stable, like it has been dead-stable in the past couple days, people trade less, many HFT/Algo's triggers won't trigger, and you see low volumes. It's pretty simple!""  He also said there was ""nothing surprising"" about volumes reaching 115,000 BTC given bitcoin's price climb from $450 to around $650 in recent weeks.  Busy trading in China  Chinese yuan (CNY) is the second-most traded fiat currency in the bitcoin ecosystem with around 19% of world volumes after the US dollar's 52%. This is despite CNY rarely being used or exchanged outside China.  Bitcoin trading and speculation also remain popular activities in China, despite repeated warnings from the country's central bank, and China's exchanges have gone from relative obscurity to among the world's busiest in the past year.  This has led to accusations of volume manipulation. Exchanges say fierce competition and the Chinese low-fee model (often 0% per trade) leads to a far higher volume of high-frequency trading (HFT), or trading algorithms deployed by actual users. As a result, in-house trading bots are not necessary.  So far, such claims have been impossible to prove either way, with reports of manipulation based on observation of movements and speculation as to the reasons. The exchanges maintain that no matter what the volume figures, their markets still have enough liquidity to buy and sell at the listed rates.

42425918,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh6Th,1406283069,Austria Offers 'Contradictory' Guidance on Bitcoin's Financial Status,"Two Austrian cabinet ministers have given guidance on bitcoin's status as a financial instrument and tax treatment by answering parliamentary questions submitted by a member of the legislature.  Perhaps most notably, the federal minister for finance and vice chancellor, Michael Spindeleggerhttps://english.bmf.gv.at/ministry/hbm/CV-Michael-Spindelegger.html, reiterated that bitcoin is not a financial instrument (that is, a tradable asset), echoing the position of the country's markets regulator, the Financial Market Authority.  The finance minister also gave guidance on how capital gains taxes from bitcoin investments would be applied. Individuals who sell bitcoin holdings within a year of purchasing them would be subject to capital gains tax, but if the digital currency assets are held beyond a year, proceeds from a sale are not subject to CGT.  The finance minister also outlined accounting rules for businesses dealing in bitcoin. Digital currency assets have to be declared as either fixed assets or working capital. Digital currency held for the long term can be depreciated.  Spindelegger classed bitcoin mining as a kind of 'industrial' activity, according to a translation by Austrian bitcoin consulting firm Coinfinity. This would make mining profits subject to value-added tax (VAT).  The federal minister for science, research and economy, Reinhold Mitterlehner, also responded to parliamentary questions. Mitterlehner's ministry holds a broad portfolio and oversees economic policy and technology and innovation, among other areas.  Financial instrument ambiguity  Mitterlehner, however, appeared to contradict the finance minister's assertion that bitcoin should not be treated as a financial instrument. Mitterlehner made reference to a German policy recognising bitcoin as a 'unit of account' and requiring commercial bitcoin transactions to gain permission from the German financial markets regulator.  ""The two ministries contradict each other, so there is no [clear] way to interpret [the guidance],"" said Peter Šurda, an Austrian economist who studies bitcoin.  Another area of ambiguity centred on bitcoin and VAT. According to Šurda, the statements given by the ministers are vague about how companies dealing bitcoin should have Austria's VAT of 20% applied to transactions.  He gave the example of a brokerage that charged a commission for exchanging bitcoin. The tax could be applied just to the commissions, or the brokerage could be liable for VAT on the transacted amount, which would be a significantly heavier tax burden. Surda said the ambiguity could pose a risk for operators of bitcoin ATMs, for example.  Coinfinity operates a Lamassu ATM in the city of Graz. However, its founders remain unconcerned about the latest guidance on VAT, noting that an EU-wide standardised treatment of VAT for bitcoin is due in the coming months.  ""Operationally, it doesn't change much. We're currently charging commission for the ATM, and treating that as subject to VAT,"" said Stefan Kliment, a co-founder of Coinfinity.  Parliamentary questions  The written parliamentary questions on bitcoin were submitted by Niko Alm, a member of parliament and liberal NEOS party. Written questions must be answered within two months of being submitted. Alm is also a journalist, and the editor of the Austrian edition of Vice magazine.  An unconventional politician, Alm made international headlines in 2011 when he won the right to use a photo of himself wearing a pasta-strainer as headgear on his driver's licence. Alm's rationale was that the strainer qualified as 'religious headgear' because he is a committed 'pastafarian'.

42425930,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh6lh,1406262616,Coin Congress Day 2: Bitcoin Industry Bullish in Face of Obstacles,"The second day of Coin Congress in San Francisco focused less on recent US regulatory developments, instead placing a heightened emphasis on the promise of bitcoin's underlying technology.  Held at the Union Square Hilton this week, the event featured a variety of speakers and panels. Experts offered unique perspectives on the bitcoin and cryptocurrency economy, and with their remarks succeeded at framing the industry as a fast-developing space worthy of its early accolades.  Despite the promise and excitement surrounding the industry, however, event commentators were keen to point out the obstacles that bitcoin needs to overcome in order to bring its full capabilities to market.  The mainstream portrayal of bitcoin in the media appears to be one issue, according to Michael Terpin, who founded the PR service Marketwired in the early 1990s. He says negative headlines sell, and that bitcoin is paying a heavy price because of this.  Terpin said:  ""The media is like a sponge, waiting for the loudest click-bait to happen.""  Perception and adoption  Discussion on the perception of bitcoin continued through the day, with one specific panel addressing the issue directly. There, George Gilder, an author, investor and moderator of the perception panel, called cryptocurrency, ""a new category of information on the Internet that fulfills the real promise of the Internet"".  Due to this type of praise, speakers were emboldened about the currency and its prospects.  Tim Parsa, CEO of BitReserve, said:  ""Anything you fight, you make stronger.""  Bradley Rotter, co-chair of hardware startup Rivetz, echoed this positive sentiment, saying that digital currencies were inevitable with the advent of the web.  ""Does the internet deserve its own currency? Of course it does,"" Rotter noted.  Lee Fox, founder of Peerspring, said that demographic shifts will foster distributed systems adoption no matter what. She said she sees this in a younger generations that is, ""already circumventing what was once centralized"".  Venture capitalists still positive  The Coin Congress venture capital panel offered similarly positive opinions on the long-term opportunities that bitcoin presents, as commentators were optimistic bitcoin could overcome its perception issues.  The VCs were perhaps unsurprisingly bullish on investing in bitcoin businesses.  Bart Stephens, managing partner of Stephens Investment Management, said there is ""massive opportunity to connect the financial world to bitcoin"".  Waterhouse said:  ""[The] IP address is not a consumer technology. The question is whether [bitcoin] is a consumer technology or an infrastructure technology. It’s likely an infrastructure technology.""  RRE Ventures' James Robinson, offered a different assessment, saying that he believes consumers will continue to choose banks over BTC.  Robinson added:  ""You may not like [banks], but you know that your money will be there tomorrow.""  Jonathan Teo, managing director of Binary Capital, said that the amount of VC flowing into bitcoin companies is only going to increase, a promising statement for entrepreneurs, as many were in attendance at the conference for industry networking and knowledge sharing.  “There will be a lot more venture dollars flowing into the digital currency space,” Teo said.  Mergers and acquisitions  Despite optimism from VCs, even this segment of the industry faces pressing issues.  For example, there have not been any significant financial exits in the bitcoin space to date. William Quigley, managing director of Clearstone Venture Partners, presented on the possibilities of merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in bitcoin, basing his assessments on historical observations from the early Internet days.  ""[That] bubble really was about 18 months,"" he said.  Quigley told the Coin Congress audience that he expects a similar situation to unfold in the digital currency space, adding:  ""With respect to bitcoin, I see lots of acquisitions happening quickly.""  Quigley estimated that there are about 700- 800 bitcoin startups in total right now, and with only 100 venture-backed companies that go public every year, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) might be the way many bitcoin-related ventures will likely see a financial exit.  ""A lot companies are going to be acquired,"" he said.  However, bitcoin-related companies with the potential to be purchased for $1bn or more will need to be what Quigley called an ""operating business"" – not just an idea or play on bitcoin, but something with substantial customer numbers.  And in order to get to that level, VC money will be needed to deal with regulatory matters.  Quigley said:  ""Compliance cannot be ignored, especially in the United States. This is why bitcoin startups will have to raise capital.""  Technology advancing  Technology was yet another major theme, with speakers touching on the latest developments in the space.  Bitcoin entrepreneur and former Tradehill co-founder Ryan Singer encouraged developers to use technologies such as multisig in order to avoid actually hosting cryptocurrency for users.  ""I think it’s getting more uncomfortable,"" to hold other people’s coins, he said. Because of new regulation possibly on the horizon, hosting features like wallets might end up being prohibitively expensive for a startup.  ""If you hold other people’s money, you are going to have to bond and insure it,"" Singer said.  Multisig technology like the sort BitGo offers requires several keys in to manage bitcoin funds, reducing possible risks associated with controlling funds the way that many hosted wallets currently do.  Singer noted:  ""It is possible to do full transactions without being in the business of holding bitcoin.""  Another idea along these lines was presented called Rivetz, a hardware technology for financial independence outside of the existing banking system.  ""I want to build [bitcoin functionality] into the device I have at the time,"" said Rivetz CEO Stephen Sprague during his talk titled 'Building a Hardware Wallet into the Device You Have'.  The startup is building a digital currency storage system that harnesses existing technological capabilities inside consumer electronics devices such as a PCs, phones and tablets.

42425920,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh6Vh,1406260346,"Ecuador Bans Bitcoin, Plans Own Digital Money","The National Assembly of Ecuador has effectively banned bitcoin and decentralized digital currencies while establishing guidelines for the creation of a new, state-run currency.  With 91 votes in favor of the amendments to the country’s existing monetary and financial laws, the National Assembly approved a bill that now goes to President Rafael Correa for signature.  The law gives the government permission to make payments in 'electronic money', but decentralized digital currencies like bitcoin will now be prohibited.  The proposed electronic money is to be backed by the assets of the Banco Central del Ecuador, the nation’s central bank. The National Assembly will oversee the new currency while the central bank will develop and integrate it into the broader financial system. The electronic money will operate in tandem with the US dollar, Ecuador’s official currency, although it is not certain what exchange rate will be established.  Following the final tally, the National Assembly issued a statement declaring that the new electronic money would offer benefits to both the underbanked and the broader economy, saying:  ""Electronic money will stimulate the economy, it will be possible to attract more Ecuadorian citizens, especially those who do not have checking or savings accounts and credit cards alone. The electronic currency will be backed by the assets of the Central Bank of Ecuador.""  Community voices concern prior to vote  Prior to the debate on amendments that instituted the decentralized digital currency prohibition, members of the local bitcoin community sought to shape the final outcome.  In an open letter from La Comunidad Bitcoin Ecuador, the country’s largest bitcoin organization, members urged the legislature to allow for transparency and respect for the rights of consumers when creating a new digital currency, saying:  “Ecuador, as a pioneer in the creation of a digital state-run currency, must use methodologies that respect fundamental rights. The digital-currency system must be verifiable, and its code must be published as free software, to ensure the system’s privacy through algorithms.”  CoinDesk reached out to the organization for comment but did not receive an immediate response.  Impact on industry immediate  With the bill passed and sent to President Correa’s desk for what is expected to be a speedy approval, the impact on the bitcoin industry in Ecuador is now clear.  Companies offering digital currency services will have to withdraw from operations or cease entirely, as the bill prohibits the “emission, production, initiation, falsifications, or any other type of [digital currency] simulation, and its circulation through any channel or way of representation” of non-sanctioned digital currencies, according to the PanAm Post. This includes BitPagos, which recently raised $600,000 and had plans to grow in Ecuador’s bitcoin market.  The amendments laid out the legal framework for those who violate the ban, which establishes the power to confiscate bitcoins or similar holdings. Those who operate businesses using prohibited digital currencies face the risk of prosecution as well.  What remains to be seen is how the Ecuadorian public, including those who had already begun using bitcoin, will respond to the new electronic money. Its final form and level of transparency will no doubt have an impact, given the concerns stated in La Comunidad Bitcoin Ecuador's letter.  At the same time, it's possible that the regulations may not, in practice, prohibit decentralized digital currencies. Paul Buitink, who runs bitcoin information site deBitcoin.org, told CoinDesk that the exact legal definition of bitcoin in Ecuador is not clear, meaning that the amendments don't cover bitcoin.  He explained:  ""With money, do they mean the legal tender dollar? Or any kind of other money? Is Bitcoin money at all? Etc. Also it doesn't say you can't accept it as merchant or use it as a consumer. So it's very broad, albeit worrisome.""
