The application was published on August 30, detailing a system by which ""autonomous electronic devices"" communicate with each other wirelessly and pass transported objects to each other after an identification process.  After one drone travels to a specific spot where another one is located, they exchange authentication signals using ""blockchain keys,"" and if the first robot successfully recognizes its ""co-worker,"" it passes the package. Drones would rely on a database of delivery information stored on whichever blockchain the company is operating.  To identify each other, robots use can use a variety of means to actually send signals from one to the other, including RFID codes, QR codes or ultrasound, the patent filing says.  Further, each of the delivery robots can be kitted out with unique features in order for it to be easily identified by other drones.  Per the filing, the use of automated technology is envisioned as a way to reduce the times at which elements of the delivery process have to be ""trusted."" Indeed, Walmart argues that the fact that consumers would have to trust the delivery of their goods to flying machines ""raises challenges related to security"" and requires a reliable system of identification for the drones.  The blockchain system described in the filing comprises ""a plurality of nodes configured to generate computational proof of record integrity and the chronological order of its use for content, trade, and/or as a currency of exchange through a peer-to-peer network,"" the document says, and ""each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its bloc."" Smart contracts also can be built into this framework, according to Walmart's team.

Making the announcement in a blog post on Saturday, the company said that, while an API exists for commonly used functions such as checking transaction status or wallet balances, it's not so easy to access all of the data stored on the ethereum blockchain.  The post continues to say that ""perhaps more importantly,"" the API doesn't allow for viewing blockchain data ""in aggregate.""  Aiming the new service to provide more of a Big Data window into ethereum, Google said:  ""A visualization like this ... is useful for making business decisions, such as prioritizing improvements to the ethereum architecture itself (is the system running close to capacity and due for an upgrade?) to balance sheet adjustments (how quickly can a wallet be rebalanced?).""  The software system Google has built on its Cloud platform does several things: it synchronizes the ethereum blockchain to computers running Parity; it pulls data from the ethereum ledger on a daily basis, including the results of smart contract transactions; and it ""de-normalizes and stores date-partitioned data to BigQuery for easy and cost-effective exploration.""  In some examples of why the addition may be useful and/or interesting to users, Google sets out several examples, showing that, for one, CryptoKitties (a crypto collectibles game) has by far the most numerous ERC-721 smart contract transactions on the ethereum network.  It further adds a visualization for ""pedigrees"" of accounts that own more than 10 CryptoKitties:  A second example looks at data from ERC-20 token project OmiseGo, with a visualization that shows how token recipients spiked on Sept. 13, 2017, while senders didn't. The explanation? The surge marked the OmiseGo project's airdrop of tokens to its community.  Data from the bitcoin network  was added to BigQuery earlier this year, according to the post.  Anyone interested in using Google's new service can already query ethereum's data in Kaggle.  Edit (07:45 UTC, Sept. 4, 2018): The article was amended to clarify detail of the CryptoKitties data, in particular that it runs on an ERC-721 smart contract.  Hat tip The Next Web.

42401895,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2j4z,1535976030,World Bank Bond Blockchain Offers Key Insights,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      Cryptocurrency purists often dismiss private blockchains as overly expensive undertakings for projects that are better served with a traditional database.  Yet these distributed ledger solutions keep being rolled out by enterprises in various settings – mostly still in experimental phases, but, increasingly, with real money at stake. And while they fall short of the public blockchain ideals of censorship resistance and permissionlessness, these contained, private experiments are extremely useful to the development of the overall blockchain industry.  While crypto investors lick their wounds in a bear market and developers plug away at scalability fixes for public blockchains, we can learn a great deal from how economic actors behave in these controlled situations where transactions involving multiple non-trusting parties are collectively recorded in a shared ledger.  One example came last month, with a first-of-its-kind blockchain bond issuance by the World Bank. In partnership with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the international development institution used a private Ethereum blockchain to sell a two-year bond worth 110 million Australian dollars ($79 million) to seven investors.  This was hardly the disintermediated, peer-to-peer securities sale that crypto finance disrupters dream of – the Commonwealth Bank played the role of dealer, essentially that of an underwriter. And the two institutions were the only ones running nodes, of which there were just four in total.  But the fact that they could both witness and confirm the investors' purchases in real time removed the need for time-consuming reconciliation and offered real efficiency gains, says Paul Snaith, Head of Operations for Capital Markets, Banking and Payments at the World Bank Treasury.  ""The experience we've had so far is already demonstrating that we may be able to rethink some of the functions that current markets require,"" Snaith said in an interview.  Cutting the cost of issuance  For full, seamless, real-time settlement, operations like these will need to integrate some form of digital currency. And while progress is being made on that front, a digital fiat currency or stablecoin that's acceptable to major financial institutions is still some way off.  Nonetheless, in enabling ""atomic settlement"" of the security transfer side of these transactions, the World Bank's experiment showed that a blockchain bond could ""potentially reduce the settlement problem to seconds rather than days,"" Snaith said.  The cost savings could be significant. The World Bank issues $50-$60 billion in bonds every year. The potential reduction in underwriting costs and, just as important, in settlement and counterparty risk could be a significant funding advantage to the institution, which leaves it with more money to pursue its mandate of supporting development in low-income countries.  Moreover, the concept's relevance goes beyond the World Bank's bottom line. The model could be of benefit to the governments of those same countries, too.  ""It could result in a much lower cost for developing countries to issue, or to borrow for a project, and that might be interesting,"" Snaith said. ""I think there is potential for this type of platform to be used by issuers who might otherwise be pushed aside for cost reasons.""  Multilateral agencies: unlikely blockchain experimenters  The fact that the World Bank, which last year launched a blockchain lab to explore a variety of development-focused use cases for the technology, is taking a leading role in experimentation with it is significant – if perhaps a surprise, given its reputation for heavy bureaucracy.  As I've argued elsewhere, I also see its engagement – along with the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations – as an opportunity for everyone, including even libertarian crypto developers intent on bypassing such centralized entities, to learn about the real world impact of blockchain technology on our global financial system.  Some form of distributed ledger architecture will eventually become the norm for all forms of capital raising – bonds, stocks and commodity futures, not to mention the new ""asset class:"" crypto utility tokens – with trillions of dollars in potential payoffs. International development agencies are in as good a place as any institution right now to drive progress toward that end.  Unlike government officials, who face constant political demands, and company executives, who worry about shareholder reactions to quarterly earnings, the people who run these international development institutions have fewer such conflicts. They can't take radical steps – Snaith's team has been unable to carry out once-planned experiments in cross-border payments with cryptocurrencies, for example – but they have greater freedom to test out new approaches in the pure pursuit of efficiency.  And while this model used a narrowly defined distributed ledger and a ""proof of authority"" consensus mechanism, people at the World Bank, the IMF and the UN frequently tell me they see the longer-term advantages of fully permissionless systems once they can handle large-scale capacity with much less price volatility. In the meantime, during this lull period for crypto assets, in which developers are being encouraged to ""BUIDL,"" much progress could be made in working with these institutions in these controlled settings.  More to come  The good news is that there is more to learn from the life cycle of the newly issued World Bank bond. Though only a two-year issuance – unlike the Bank's usual five- and ten-year bonds – there are still four more ""events"" to study: three six-monthly payments of interest coupons and the final maturity of the instrument when the principal repayment and final interest disbursement will be made.  Moreover, Snaith and his staff expect to see secondary market trading emerge in the bonds, which means more investors will be on-boarded, and it plans to bring on TD Securities as a market maker running a full node on the system. They have also had discussions with the Reserve Bank of Australia, the country's central bank, about it potentially running an observer node.  All of this will provide valuable learning – not only for the World Bank, its government partners and direct financial counterparties – but for any entity involved in capital markets.  There's still much to be done before these distributed solutions become the norm. But with hundreds of trillions of dollars locked up in a global securities market that's rife with trust problems, burdened with massive middlemen costs and prone to wealth-destroying crises, developments such as this one are welcome.

42401899,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2j6x,1535972405,Bitcoin Price Faces Minor Drop After One-Month Highs,"With signs of bull exhaustion showing on the technical charts, bitcoin (BTC) faces a return to the psychological support of $7,000.  At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $7,235 on Bitfinex – representing a 0.4 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Prices found acceptance above $7,000 over the weekend, having cleared the resistance offered by the 50-day and 100-day moving averages (MAs) last week and rose to $7,429 yesterday – the highest level since Aug. 4.  While the bull grip around BTC strengthened in the last seven days, prices failed to cut through the resistance of the trendline sloping upwards from the June 29 low and Aug. 12 low, possibly due to buyer exhaustion. This should not come as a surprise as BTC has rallied nearly 27 percent in the 2.5 weeks without notable price pullback.  As a result, BTC could feel the pull of gravity in the next 24 hours, although overall outlook remains bullish as long as prices do not find acceptance below $7,000.  4-hour chart  As seen in the above chart, BTC created a gravestone doji candle yesterday, suggesting the upside momentum has weakened – that is, the bulls failed to push prices above the trendline hurdle and the bears regained lost ground.  Further, the relative strength index (RSI) rolling over from above 80.00 (overbought territory) is calling for profit taking or healthy pullback.  Prices could, therefore, drop to the rising wedge support, currently seen at $7,040, but, with the 100-candle MA crossing the 200-candle MA from below (bull cross), the support will likely hold.  The stacking order of the 50-candle, above the 100-candle, above the 200-candle, is a typical bullish signal.  Daily chart  The daily chart shows that the 5-day and 10-day MAs continue to trend north, indicating a short-term bullish setup, as well as a bullish crossover between the 50-day and 100-day MAs. The RSI, too, is biased toward the bulls.  Only if the bears manage to pull off a downside break of the rising wedge is a deeper sell-off likely.  View  BTC could be in for a minor pullback to $7,040–$7,000 in the next 24 hours.  The overall bias remains bullish, as seen in the daily chart, hence, BTC will likely defend the support at $7,000 and could resume the journey back towards $7,500.  A downside break of the rising wedge would signal a bear revival and shift risk in favor of a drop to support at $6,650 (multiple daily highs).

The research, released Friday by iPR Daily, a media outlet specializing in intellectual property, shows that Chinese internet giant Alibaba tops the list with a total of 90 patent applications focused on blockchain-related technologies.  In second place is IBM, which falls just one short of that total with 89 filings, while Mastercard occupies third place with 80 filings. Bank of America made it to fourth place, with 53 blockchain patent applications.  For its ranking, iPR Daily said it consolidated information from patent databases as of Aug. 10 from China, the U.S., Europe, Japan and South Korea, as well as the International Patent System from the World Intellectual Property Organization.  Notably, the People's Bank of China (PBoC), fifth on the list, marks one of the few central banks in the world to have moved into the blockchain industry with a total of 44 patent applications focused on its planned central bank digital currency.  As CoinDesk reported in June, the PBoC's Digital Currency Lab, spearheaded by Yao Qian, filed over 40 patent applications within 12 months of its launch. Each patent constitutes part of a major effort by the central bank to create a digital currency combining core features of cryptocurrency and the country's existing monetary system.  Other notable companies on the iPR Daily list that have filed at least 20 blockchain-related patent applications include Tencent, Accenture, Ping An Insurance, Bitmain, Intel, Visa, Sony, Google and China's State Grid Corporation.  The report arrives at a time when technologies developed by some of the featured firms are starting to be moved into real-world production.  For instance, Alibaba recently launched a payments corridor based on a distributed network will settle financial transactions for residents living in Hong Kong and the Philippines.  Tencent also piloted an application via its WeChat messaging service that used blockchain to speed up the process of reimbursing corporate employees' expenses.

42401896,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2j5y,1535961685,Nano Was August's Top-Performing Big Crypto Despite Yearly Low,"The cryptocurrency markets had a rough run in August, with only a handful of projects making it into the green.  Major names such as ethereum, bitcoin and XRP all dropped on the month, down 35.45, 9.44, and 27.93 percent, respectively.  Adding pressure to the situation, bitcoin's dominance rate rose substantially, up 6 points from July's period of 48.34 to 54.58 percent on Aug. 15 – levels not seen since December last year.  The high rate was a telling sign that traders were uncertain about price direction, utilizing bitcoin to exit the market through a transfer of crypto to fiat.  One name, however, made a substantial case against broader bearish market conditions to reach the top spot of August's best-performing crypto assets.  Nano delivered exceptional gains during the second half of the month despite falling to a yearly low of $0.74 on Aug. 14.  After fighting off the worst day in its two-year history, nano rose 73.85 percent over the August period and outperformed the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization to finish ahead by a margin of 50 percent against the other big names according to CoinMarketCapdata.  The token's overall market cap also rose more than $160 million on the month, almost doubling from $260 million to $420 million, and pushing its ranking briefly from 27th to 24th on Aug. 30 before it slipped back to 28th spot on the final day of the month.  Monthly performance  Monthly performance: +73.85 percent  All-time high: $34.43  Closing price on August 31: 3.01  Current market price: $2.92  Rank as per market capitalization: 28  Nano began its climb on Aug. 15 after the bears were finally exhausted at the yearly low of $0.74.  Savvy investors immediately snapped up discounted prices, leaving a long tail wick from the bottom on Aug. 14's candle (a sign of a bullish reversal). By the end of the month, it had managed to close above $3.00 after defying a last minute sell-off on Aug. 30.  Nano's all-time high was $34.43 back in December last year. At time of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $2.92, 89 percent down from that peak.  Daily chart  Nano was supported by the 8-day exponential moving average (EMA) over the second half of August, which had acted as the resistance level during most of the month of July.  As Nano closed convincingly above on Aug. 16, a bearish-to-bullish trend change occurred.  More importantly, total volume also picked up, with Aug. 26 seeing the most volume traded on record at $25.05 million during a single daily period, validating the rally to the monthly high of $3.79.  Looking ahead, prices could defy expectations in September, albeit after a retracement to the lower end of the 8-day EMA at $2.80 in the coming days – that's because the relative strength index, used to judge the momentum and trend of a particular asset, is showing overbought conditions.  Correction (09:45 UTC, Sept. 3, 2018): This article has been amended to correct an error that said nano had hit an all-time low in August. In fact, it was a yearly low.

The government of Tsukuba, a city known for its role in scientific development since the 1960s, completed the blockchain test on Aug. 28 with 119 votes gathered, according to a news report by the Japan Times on Sunday.  The technology was used to select what's called social contribution projects from a pool of proposals focused on technology applications including the internet of things and artificial intelligence, based on the government's website.  The report said the system integrates an identity verification machine with a decentralized network. After putting an ID card on the machine for verification, voters went on to select their preferred programs. The system further encrypted and stored the data of their ballots via the tamper-proof distributed network.  ""I had thought it would involve more complicated procedures, but I found that it's minimal and easy,"" Tsukuba's mayor Tatsuo Igarashi was quoted as saying after he also cast a vote via the system.  A report from the Jiji news agency on Saturday said, if the application proves successful after further review, the local government expects to expand the service to residents living in mountainous areas, remote islands and foreign countries.  The test is the latest instance where governments haved turn to distributed ledger technology for casting and securing ballots.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the U.S. state of West Virginia is also set to adopt a blockchain-based application statewide to help absentee voters from the military based overseas to vote remotely in the November elections.

42401892,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2j13,1535947211,Microsoft Is Connecting Its Major Products to Blockchain – Here's Why,"Three years ago, Microsoft Azure was the first to bring blockchain to the cloud. Now it's connecting the technology to just about everything else.  The software giant has quietly been building bridges between its blockchain services and other, widely used infrastructure and platforms, such as Office 365 Outlook, SharePoint Online, Salesforce, Dynamics 365 CRM Online, SAP, and even Twitter, according to Matt Kerner, the general manager of Microsoft Azure. The idea is to allow Microsoft customers to port their data from these platforms into the cloud, and from there onto a blockchain.  Why? In addition to the usually touted blockchain efficiencies, one of the less-discussed benefits of distributed ledger technology (DLT) in a cloud environment like Azure, according to Microsoft, is that it amasses data from multiple companies in a standardized format at scale. The potential to mine data for all sorts of insights then becomes limitless, the company reckons.  Hence, the company is integrating tools such as Microsoft Flow and Logic Apps – which offer hundreds of connectors to thousands of applications – into Azure Blockchain Workbench, a service it launched in May to make the creation of blockchain apps easier (Workbench currently has ethereum Proof of Authority configured as the consensus protocol).  It's all a part of the evolution of Big Data, Kerner explained. Prior to blockchain, he pointed out, cloud computing enabled departments within the same company to break out of their data silos and collaborate on heterogeneous data sets, increasing smarts through machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI).  ""Blockchain empowers the next step – enabling a single, authentic data set shared across counterparties. This is already improving the way transactions happen,"" Kerner told CoinDesk, adding, ""We believe the same will be true with data analytics.""  Stepping back, many would argue that data is now the most valuable naturally occurring resource on the planet. As the race to prove the best data analytics intensifies, firms are springing up whose sole purpose is to structure and format data to run AI algorithms on.  But with enterprise blockchain, you get the structured and formatted data part thrown in for free, as Kerner said many Azure customers were discovering.  ""What blockchain is doing is creating a multi-party business process that is moving out of email, phone calls, spreadsheets and into a single system with a single view on the data that all of the participants can rely upon and trust,"" he said.  Looking ahead, Kerner said bringing vast amounts of unstructured and siloed data into a context where it could be leveraged and even shared would drive exponential change. He said:  ""Even the fiercest of competitors can onboard and mutually derive benefit from that system and find new revenue streams.""  Taking on IBM  A good example of Azure connecting and balancing components in a large and complex production environment is Insurwave, which simplifies maritime insurance for shipping hauls carried by Maersk.  The platform was built using R3's Corda platform with help from EY and Guardtime and is now in commercial production with insurers such as Willis Towers Watson, XL Catlin, and MS Amlin.  Insurwave, which tracks cargos and adjusts insurance premiums in real time, collates all sorts of data, everything from internet of things (IoT) sensors monitoring temperature, to whether the ship is going to hit a storm, or enter a war zone or an area heavily populated with pirates. Once this data is shared on the blockchain, Power BI, a Microsoft business analytics tool, can be used to gain insights about shipping hauls, Kerner said.  Further, Ricardo Correia, a managing director and head of partner management at R3, said its relationship with Microsoft is a good deal more than Azure being Corda's default preferred cloud.  In addition to a one-click Corda capability, Correia pointed to integrating Corda into modules within the Azure marketplace.  ""This enables Corda to plug into a number of different capabilities including Azure SQL, active directory for identity access management and key vault for key management,"" he said.  Some of this is already in place because of Insurwave, with deeper integration also happening in a number of use cases. Notable ones include the webJet blockchain, which aims to reconcile hotels and other travel arrangements on a single ledger, and was cited by R3's CTO Richard Brown as an example of Corda extending beyond mainstream finance.  Widening the lens, the ability to track items in real time and share things like IoT data using a blockchain has made global trade and supply chain a leading light in terms of domains to chase. From a strategic point of view, Insurwave challenges IBM's bid for global trade dominance, which also has Maersk in the position of flagship, so to speak.  IBM has openly stated that this was its No. 1 target. However, Correia said Microsoft is also making its mark in supply chain – perhaps with a little less fanfare. ""It's in their interest given they too have very large supply chains with a number of their product offerings,"" he said.  In terms of offering blockchain as a service, IBM has championed Hyperledger Composer for the past couple of years. However, there may be some question marks over the design of Composer, at least from an IBM perspective.  Azure's Kerner was tactfully equivocal about Microsoft's enterprise blockchain rivals, adding that everything is built with an eye towards enabling a consortium that's not exclusively on Azure.  ""It's got to be open. Any meaningful consortium is going to have members who have different choices that they have made around their cloud provider and who they choose to work with,"" he said.
