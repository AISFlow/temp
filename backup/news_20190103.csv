42402386,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCbnE,1546542016,Proof of Keys Explained: Bitcoin’s First Planned ‘Bank Run’ Is Today,"Do your bitcoins really exist?  The answer might seem like an obvious “yes,” but the brewing “Proof of Keys” movement, launching today, argues the answer is not so clear.  How in control a person is of their coins depends on where and how the bitcoin is stored. So participants will be taking their money out of third-party bitcoin services, moving it to accounts only they themselves control.  “We’re going to withdraw all our bitcoin from any third party services just to prove that they’re there,” said Trace Mayer, Proof of Keys leader and bitcoin podcast host, in a video announcing the project, adding:  ”It’s on the blockchain or it didn’t happen.”  As described by Mayer, the motivation is simple. Many bitcoiners leave their bitcoins on exchanges. This is risky, as millions (er, billions) of dollars have been stolen from exchanges by way of hacks over the years. Not to mention, it means users don’t really have full control over their money — a fact many might not realize.  The movement debuts on the 10th anniversary of bitcoin’s first-ever block, the day bitcoin’s anonymous creator turned his or her theory into a living, breathing digital currency.  Proof of Keys has been compared to a “bank run,” where a flood of people withdraw their money from a bank, worried that the institution is going under. But unlike old-fashioned runs, this one is pre-planned and deliberate.  If enough people pull their money off exchanges, advocates argue, it’ll expose, and perhaps topple, the ones that are operating like fractional-reserve banks (i.e. keeping only a sliver of depositors' cash on hand and available for withdrawal).  Big names such as former Symbiont president Caitlin Long, smart contract pioneer Nick Szabo, Coinbase CTO Balaji S. Srinivasan, and CoinKite CEO Rodolfo Novak have all etched the Proof of Keys symbol prominently in their Twitter profiles. Even bitcoin companies like Shapeshift and Casa have thrown their support behind the effort.  Taking control  So, what do participants have to do? Not much or a lot, depending on the user’s point of view.  The first task is for users to take control of their private keys. While bitcoin is “trustless,” most users hand their bitcoin to a third party who takes care of it for them. The risk is, if this service is hacked (or goes down for another reason), all their bitcoins are lost.  “Proof of Keys” advocates argue users need to move their private keys to a device, such as a secure hardware wallet, where they actually have full control of their money.  The second job for users is to spin up what’s known as a bitcoin “full node,” which keeps a history of every transaction ever made on bitcoin, as well as the rules binding the global network together. That way they can validate which transactions are following the rules, without relying on anyone else. (Developers have drawn up zillions of guides for setting this up. It’s possible to purchase nodes that work out-of-the-box as well.)  If this sounds like a mouthful, some users have already done it, posting their results to Twitter. And advocates argue the learning experience (however time-consuming) is worth it.  “Learning how to do this will teach you about private keys and monetary sovereignty,” tweeted Srinivasan.  Mayer takes this a bit further.  “Anyone who doesn’t want you to hold your own private keys — they’re your monetary enemy. They don’t want you to be free and independent with your money,” Mayer adds. “That’s just the way it is.”  But participating users need to be careful.  “There is some legitimate concern that some people will withdraw their funds from exchanges without knowing how to store them properly” pseudonymous bitcoin subreddit moderator Bashco wrote, posting a few tips for a safe transition.  War cry vs. camaraderie  You might be wondering, how much of an impact will this day have?  One confusing aspect is that while today is the official ""Proof of Keys"" day, not everyone is participating on the same day. Some users have been taking control of their keys leading up to today, posting their results on social media.  Further, it will be pretty difficult to track how much of the community shifts over, Mayer argued to CoinDesk: “Really, it is an intensely personal type of activity which will be hard to measure.”  But, the way some users talk — calling Proof of Keys “bitcoin’s independence day” and a “monetary sovereignty war-cry” — it sounds as if the end goal is for all cryptocurrency users to suddenly move their keys to a device they control and spin up full nodes on fancy hardware device, making bitcoin exchanges all but obsolete.  But Mayer is expecting the result to be less subversive – and more of a bonding experience.  “I think most companies and individuals will operate normally with no significant interruptions, the bitcoin network will be strengthened in its decentralization properties, and many individuals and the community will have a sense of accomplishment and camaraderie,” Mayer told CoinDesk.  And other Proof of Keys advocates admit that many users cherish convenience, not necessarily having the time or enthusiasm to store their bitcoins securely and spin up a full node.  As one reddit user put it:  “If it helps even a handful of newcomers or veterans set up their own wallet and start to understand how their assets are stored, great. I'm just not expecting some big thing to happen.”  Image via CryptoScamHub Twitter",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/01/03/proof-of-keys-explained-bitcoins-first-planned-bank-run-is-today,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f213692fd8f2e18ca7b28234d5faca43be45f643-1101x606.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402389,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCbqB,1546534845,Overstock Will Pay Some of Its 2019 Taxes in Bitcoin,"Digital retail giant Overstock.com plans to pay at least some of its taxes using bitcoin this year.  The company announced on its investor portal Thursday that it would pay some of its state commercial activity taxes in Ohio using bitcoin, becoming the first major business to do so. Ohio announced last year that it would allow businesses to pay taxes in bitcoin, though the payments would be converted into dollars by a third party before the state accepted them.  In a statement, Overstock CEO and founder Patrick Byrne said the company was ""proud to partner"" with the Ohio government ""to help usher in an era of trust through technology for our nation's essential financial systems,"" adding:  ""We have long thought that thoughtful governmental adoption of emerging technologies such as cryptocurrencies (when accompanied by non-restrictive legislation over these technologies) is the best way to ensure the U.S. does not lose our place at the forefront of the ever-advancing global economy.""  Ohio announced in November 2018 that it would accept bitcoin for tax payments through a three-step process, where businesses sign up on the OhioCrypto.com portal, enter tax details and transmit the payment using a compatible bitcoin wallet.  Bitcoin processor BitPay would then convert the cryptocurrency into a U.S. dollar equivalent, which would be passed to the office of the Ohio Treasurer.  Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel praised Overstock's move, saying the company's ""embrace of blockchain technology was ahead of its time"" in a statement Thursday.  Overstock has been accepting bitcoin as payment for purchases since 2014, and a subsidiary, Medici Ventures, acts as an investment wing in blockchain startups. The company is also developing a security token trading platform called tZERO.  Byrne has said he plans to sell the flagship retail business early this year, which would leave the company with Medici and a chunk of change.

42402390,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCbrA,1546526750,BitTorrent Is Launching Its Own Cryptocurrency on the Tron Network,"BitTorrent, which pioneered peer-to-peer technology for sharing files on the internet, is creating its own cryptocurrency.  Issued by the Singapore-based BitTorrent Foundation, the new BitTorrent Token (BTT) will run on the tron protocol, developed by Tron, which acquired BitTorrent in June of last year. The file-sharing software company claims to have 100 million users.  Justin Sun, founder of Tron and CEO of BitTorrent, said in a press release:  “In one giant leap, we can introduce blockchain to hundreds of millions of users around the world and empower a new generation of content creators with the tools to distribute their content directly to others on the web.”  The plan to issue a token follows the announcement of Project Atlas, which BitTorrent revealed at the end of August. Project Atlas is a new iteration of the P2P software. It provides users with a way to spend and earn crypto while sharing files.  Under the existing system, users need to put a file on the system in order to download something. As Sun explains in a YouTube video, the user has no incentive to keep a file on the network once they have finished downloading.  With BTT, users can pay someone with the file to send it to them and they can pay for more bandwidth, so it downloads faster. With the prospect of payment, file hosts have an incentive to keep more files available to the network, making it more likely that a given user will be able to download something they want more quickly.  A Tron spokesperson confirmed that the company will not be taking a cut of those transactions.  BTT will be a TRC-10 token (comparable to the ERC-20 tokens that run on top of ethereum). According to the token's white paperhttps://www.bittorrent.com/btt/btt-docs/BitTorrent_Token_Whitepaper.pdf, shared with CoinDesk, a total supply of 990 billion BTT will be minted.  BTT will be available to non-U.S. accounts through Binance Launchpad, a listing service for entrepreneurs looking to raise funding via token sales. The tokens will also be distributed through airdrops of some kind that will be announced on Sun's Twitter feed. A spokesperson for Tron declined to give more details about the airdrops.  The token will work first through the Windows-based µTorrent Classic client, which has the most users on it. The company says that Project Atlas will be backward-compatible, so that users who don't want to spend or earn BTT will still be able to share files with those who do opt to use the new system.  More details about Tron and Project Atlas will be revealed at a summit Tron is hosting later this month in San Francisco.  Personnel changes  Prior to the acquisition last year, BitTorrent approached several companies about buying it, but only Tron followed through.  Additionally, Sun attempted to entice the company's founder, Bram Cohen, to return to a full-time role as a condition of the deal. Cohen declined and instead Sun came away with a small stake in Cohen's new company, Chia Network.  Shortly after the takeover by Tron, CoinDesk reported that staffers were leaving BitTorrent.  Since the acquisition, Rogelio Choy, CEO of BitTorrent at the time, has transitioned to a role as general manager, according to a Tron spokesperson.

42402399,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCbx4,1546526047,The First Cryptocurrency to Use Mimblewimble Privacy Tech Is Now Live,"Today marks the debut of a new cryptocurrency, called Beam – one of two highly-anticipated privacy coins implemented with the so-called “mimblewimble” protocol.  The mimblewimble protocol, which is touted as a way to make transactions confidential and virtually untraceable, first appeared in the summer of 2016, and has been widely anticipated ever since.  While another cryptocurrency, called Grin, was first theorized for the protocol at the end of 2016, Beam, which was conceived of only in March 2018, launched ahead of Grin, today at 1:40 UTC. Yet Grin developers have said they'll be releasing their coin in the next couple weeks, on January 15.  Beam, like Grin, champions a new privacy-enhanced alternative to the original bitcoin blockchain, and as such garners the support from several early bitcoin developers such as Jameson Lopp, who tweeted in September about these two projects and their upcoming release.  He tweeted:  While the two technologies are relatively similar, Beam is being run by a startup with the intention of eventually handing over operations to a dedicated non-profit foundation, whereas Grin development has been entirely community funded through donations.  As explained on Beam's official GitHub, users will be able to decide for themselves “which information will be available and to which parties, having complete control over his personal data in accordance to his will and applicable laws.""  In short, this means that Beam has the optional feature of transparency, which could be beneficial to businesses that want to use the coin but need to have some insight into who they're transacting with.  In addition, Beam (and Grin) builds upon an additional piece of technology known as Dandelion that was released a year after the infamous mimblewimble white paper. Dandelion focuses on obscuring network traffic activity by randomizing the pathways through which transactions get dispersed on a decentralized network.  Following Beam's launch, 20 percent of the overall block reward will be sent to a treasury that consists of founders, investors and the Beam Foundation. Similar to the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency zcash, this block reward will be phased out after a five year period.  Neither of the two cryptocurrencies built on mimblewimble have any intention of holding an initial coin offering (ICO) – a public sale of coins to fund development work before an official launch – and in the case of Beam, the dev team encourages users to mine directly on the newly released platform to begin earning coins.  Correction: Definition of ICO has been updated to include ""public"" and use of Dandelion technology by Grin has been made explicit.

Estonia-based DX.Exchange announced Thursday that it would launch its trading platform on Jan. 7, allowing its clients to purchase crypto tokens representing shares in different tech firms listed on the Nasdaq exchange. Customers will be able to use select cryptocurrencies, as well as fiat currencies to purchase the tokens.  The company will use Nasdaq's matching engine to facilitate the trading of digital securities, as well as protect against market manipulation. DX.Exchange customers will not be purchasing ownership of shares directly, but rather, will purchase tokens which represent shares in a company, COO Amedeo Moscato told CoinDesk.  ""Henceforth, when they become a token holder, they own stocks or portions of the company's stock, as the tokens are backed 1:1 to the real-world stocks. That makes them entitled to the same cash dividends that the stocks are worth,"" he explained.  MPS Marketplace Securities, Ltd, which DX.Exchange has an agreement with, will purchase the real-world stocks based on customer demand, and generate ERC-20 tokens to represent each share.  The actual shares themselves would be stored in a segregated account separate from any of MPS' internal funds or usage. This is intended to act as a safeguard against the company having issues or filing for bankruptcy, he explained.  Moreover, MPS will fall under the supervision of the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission, while DX.Exchange will abide by European Union regulations and authorities.  At launch, MPS said it will purchase shares in AlphaBet, Apple, Amazon.com, Facebook, Microsoft Corporation, Tesla, Netflix, Baidu, Intel Corporation and Nvidia.  In addition to the matching engine, the platform is using Nasdaq's financial information exchange (FIX) protocol, which is a standard used by a number of options securities trading firms in the U.S. The protocol defines electronic message exchanges for two parties conducting securities transactions.  DX.Exchange is also partnering with Bloomberg, with the platform powering Bloomberg's crypto center in turn.  In addition to its stock services, DX.Exchange will offer peer-to-peer crypto trading.

42402401,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCc01,1546513221,Bitcoin Eyes Test of Key Price Hurdle in First Since November,"Bitcoin (BTC) could test a key resistance line for the first time in nearly two months.  The widely followed 50-day simple moving average (SMA) line is currently located at $3,940 – $100 above bitcoin's current price of $3,840 – according to Bitstamp data.  The crucial SMA line was last put to test on Nov. 8. Back then, the SMA was located at $6,450 and was serving as a stiff resistance.  On Nov. 14, BTC nosedived below $6,000, putting the bears back into the driver's seat. As a result, the gap between the 50-day SMA line and price widened sharply in the following two weeks. Notably, on Nov. 25, the 50-day MA line was located at least $2500 above price.  That spread, however, has narrowed sharply in the last two weeks, indicating waning bearish pressures. Further, price chart analysis indicates that the bulls have won control, at least for the short-term.  BTC, therefore, could test and possibly break above the 50-day SMA line of $3,940 in the next day or two.  Daily chart  As seen above, BTC ran into offers near the 50-day SMA earlier today. Notably, at 00:05 UTC, BTC was trading $40 short of the 50-day SMA.  Despite the pullback from intraday highs near $3,900, the outlook remains bullish, as the positive divergence of the relative strength index (RSI), confirmed on Dec. 18, is still valid.  Further, 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) are beginning to curl upwards. The RSI is also biased bullish above 50.00.  The 50-day SMA is indeed trending south, indicating a bearish setup. The long-term averages, however, are lagging indicators. As a result, the price action always supersedes the long-term moving average lines.  It is worth noting that a break above the 50-day SMA, if confirmed, would open the doors to $4,170 – neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. The 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) is also located just below the neckline hurdle. So, $4,170 is the level to beat for the bulls.  6-hour chart  The triangle breakout seen in the 6-hour chart indicates that the rally from the December low of $3,122 has resumed.  The RSI is printing bullish levels above 50.00. Meanwhile, the stacking order of the 50-candle MA above the 100-candle MA is also a classic bull indicator.  View  BTC could rise above the 50-day SMA of $3,940 and extend the rally to $4,170 in the short-term.  A UTC close above $4,170 (neckline hurdle + 50-day EMA) would confirm an inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal and open up upside toward the psychological hurdle of $5,000.  The bullish case would weaken if prices drop below the support at $3,566 (Dec. 27 low).  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

According to a report from Bangkok Post on Thursday, Thailand's National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC), a unit of the Ministry of Science and Technology, has already completed the development of the system for blockchain-based voting and is looking for trial partners.  Chalee Vorakulpipat, head of the cybersecurity laboratory at NECTEC, was quoted as saying in the report:  ""Nectec developed blockchain technology for e-voting that can be applied to national, provincial or community elections, as well as business votes such as the board of directors. The goal is to reduce fraud and maintain data integrity.""  At this stage, the agency is looking to test the blockchain system on a smaller scale, such as for elections in universities, provinces and communities, and is seeking partners for the test.  For large-scale implementation, such as for general elections, the agency will require more time as ""every voter needs to have an affordable mobile internet connection and identity verification,"" Vorakulpipat said in the report.  Several countries have been looking to use blockchain technology for more efficient voting processes. Back in November, South Korea announced that it was set to test a blockchain system in an effort to improve the reliability and security of online voting.  In August, the municipal government of Japanese city Tsukuba tested a blockchain-based system that lets residents cast votes to decide on local development programs.  The U.S. state of West Virginia also planned to roll out a blockchain-based mobile voting app to all of the state’s 55 counties so that military personnel stationed overseas can more easily cast their ballots in the 2018 midterm elections.

42402393,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCbu7,1546506015,7 Legal Questions That Will Define Blockchain in 2019,"Jenny Leung is an Australian attorney (New York Bar admission pending) who will be starting as a blockchain attorney at Blakemore Fallon in 2019. Formerly, she was an attorney at the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and a privacy consultant at PwC.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  7. Will the SEC define 'sufficient decentralization?'  The SEC delivered some of its most important regulatory guidance of 2018 through conferences, interviews and personal statements. With each pronouncement, the SEC representative stated their views did not necessarily reflect the views of the SEC.  Looking back at the greatest hits, from “Every ICO I’ve seen is a security” to “If the network on which the token or coin is to function is sufficiently decentralized … the assets may not represent an investment contract” and “current offers and sales of ether are not securities transactions,"" the SEC has not officially confirmed any of these statements and has instead clarified that staff views are non-binding and create no enforceable legal rights.  Although the SEC does not make law, it may release official guidance on these areas that will effectively set up goalposts for blockchain networks to achieve “sufficient decentralization.”  Even if some level of decentralization could bring token sales outside of the SEC’s jurisdiction, was SEC Commissioner William Hinman correct in saying that the ethereum network is sufficiently decentralized? At what stage would offers and sales of a token transform from a security to a non-security?  6. Will a crypto ETF be granted?  The last remaining cryptocurrency-based ETF application, the VanEck/SolidX Bitcoin ETF, may see an answer on February 27, 2019. Some key questions that remain are:  The scope of the term “significant markets."" To quote the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust Presentation, “As issuers we are concerned the SEC staff have created a moving target in their use of the word ‘significant.’ The Staff have never provided guidance as to what ‘significant’ means, enabling them to move their goal post indefinitely.”  The correct interpretation of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Section 6(b)(5), which requires that the rules of “the exchange” are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices. Does “the exchange” refer to the national securities exchange where the ETF would trade, or the bitcoin spot market? See SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce’s dissent.  Whether the underlying bitcoin (or cryptocurrency) spot markets are indeed resistant to fraud and manipulation (and how the Department of Justice’s investigation into Tether will affect this analysis).  5. Can blockchain systems comply with privacy regulations?  The French Data Protection Authority (DPA), members of the EU Parliament and the EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum, are among the few governmental actors that have publicly acknowledged the tensions between blockchain and the GDPR, in particular the rules around the right to erasure, right to rectification and the principle of data minimization.  Some companies have simply blocked European residents from accessing their websites or services, but this may no longer be a feasible solution with California’s own privacy law (California Consumer Privacy Act) coming into effect in 2020 and the recent push for a U.S. federal privacy law.  A number of proposed solutions to GDPR compliance exist, such as zero-knowledge proofs and destruction of private keys, but it remains unclear whether they constitute methods of erasure or anonymization.  The French DPA has gone the furthest to suggest that solutions such as the destruction of private keys would allow data subjects to get closer to an effective exercise of their right of erasure.  Will the EU Data Protection Board issue guidelines and recommendations to “ensure that blockchain technology is compliant with EU law” as suggested by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs?  4. Will international regulators work together?  As blockchain projects become more geographically decentralized, anonymous and/or censorship resistant, domestic regulators must tackle breaches of their laws by facilitating global coordination or, perhaps, harmonization of their securities, commodities, money transmitter, and tax laws.  In 2018, efforts arose from IOSCO, CPMI, G20 and FSB, OECD, and the EU Blockchain Partnership (launched by the EU Commission). However, it may be years before we see any real progress due to the differing approaches and attitudes of regulators and governments around the world.  How can the wide range of regulatory responses from different nations within these international organizations be reconciled?  Are crypto investors and blockchain companies really ‘flocking to Blockchain Island Malta in droves’ and if so, how will these new crypto friendly frameworks stack up against more established, but restrictive regimes, such as the U.S. securities law framework and years of established case law?  3. Will (and can) privacy coins be banned?  While cash and fiat transactions can be controlled and monitored through banks, financial institutions and customs agents, transactions in privacy coins such as zcash and monero may be more difficult to trace due to cryptographic techniques such as zero knowledge proofs and ring signatures.  Regulation could come in the form of outright bans or regulatory pressure (see reports on Japan’s Financial Security Agency pushing crypto exchanges to delist zcash, monero and other coins earlier this year). However privacy coins may still be tradeable on foreign crypto exchanges, P2P, on OTC markets, decentralized trading platforms, or websites such as localmonero which might escape the telescopic view of regulators.  Perhaps the most practical way to regulate privacy coins today is to allow them to be traded on regulated crypto exchanges, which could encourage trading under the watchful eye of regulators and create an initial auditable trail. After all, an on/off ramp trail is better than none.  For example, two regulated crypto exchanges, Gemini and Coinbase, recently began offering the trading of zcash. Both exchanges now allow withdrawals of zcash to be made to transparent addresses only, as opposed to shielded or private addresses. As a result, there is now a discoverable trail of the initial transaction which would not have existed had it been conducted off-exchange.  Will regulators around the world follow the U.S. approach in authorizing the listing of privacy coins on regulated exchanges or Japan’s approach in encouraging the delisting of privacy coins?  2. Will we be able to regulate decentralized exchanges?  Prior to 2018, many believed that DEXs were unstoppable and rarely any DEXs implemented know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. If it did, the community would not have considered it a “true” DEX – at best it was a non-custodial exchange with a central party controlling access.  In 2018, the SEC published guidance on online platforms for trading digital assets, ShapeShift reluctantly introduced KYC in the form of compulsory membership, and the SEC fined EtherDelta’s creator for causing software to violate the law requiring registration of securities exchanges. Perhaps in 2019, true DEXs will emerge and difficult regulatory questions will proliferate.  How do you regulate an unstoppable, headless unregistered securities exchange platform? How do you regulate the trading of privacy coins on these platforms? Will recent regulatory guidance push developers to go anonymous?  1. Will developers be held responsible for violations of law?  In corporate law, the “corporate veil” allows a corporation to be treated as a separate legal entity, insulating the company’s owners, in most cases, from personal liability for the company’s violations.  Somewhat analogously, a “tech veil” has helped code developers escape liability from state and federal regulations and civil lawsuits arising from bugs in, or third parties’ malicious use of, their code. This “tech veil” is maintained by courts’ willingness to uphold broad disclaimers in open source software licenses, and is bolstered by the principled argument that users (not coders) ultimately cause and should take responsibility for criminal violations of law (e.g. see Augur’s FAQhttps://www.augur.net/faq/: “Augur is not a prediction market, it is a protocol for cryptocurrency users to create their own prediction markets”).  However, just as the corporate veil can be pierced under certain circumstances, the “tech veil” may be as well – and 2018 provided hints as to when this could occur: first, when CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz suggested that smart contract code developers could be prosecuted for wrong doing where it was reasonably foreseeable the code would likely be used by U.S. persons in a manner violative of CFTC regulations; and second, when the SEC charged Zachary Coburn (founder of EtherDelta and writer/deployer of the EtherDelta smart contract) with operating an unregistered national securities exchange.  What is or is not reasonably foreseeable in an age of constant innovation?  How, if at all, will courts and regulators distinguish between the role of the code writer, deployer of the code, and platform operator? Will the “tech veil” be pierced further in criminal or civil cases and if so, how will enforcement be affected by decentralized networks, unstoppable smart contracts and anonymous code developers?

42402394,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCbw5,1546488644,"How to Last the Crypto Winter? Seek Simplicity, Manage Complexity","Jake Yocom-Piatt is the Project Lead for Decred, a hyper-secure, adaptable and self-funding digital currency.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  In 2018, we have seen the cryptocurrency market cap go from all-time highs in January to falling over 80 percent by December, despite little changing in the context of the technological fundamentals.  If little has changed with the fundamentals, then there must be other factors driving the manic buying and panic selling cycles present in these markets? A persistent pattern I have observed in the context of investors and projects in the space is one of information asymmetry.  This information asymmetry manifests itself in various contexts, e.g. either being a very informed or a very uninformed investor, the ability to determine if a project has overpromised on its technological deliverables or not. Another way of viewing this asymmetry is that it arises from hidden complexity, whether we’re talking about perceiving the value in an asset or implementing a new piece of software.  While I can describe bitcoin in a single phrase as “gamification of time-stamping,"" describing and delivering a working system that implements that concept is a serious technical challenge.  With Decred, we experienced this hidden complexity firsthand while building Politeia, a time-ordered filesystem, for use as our proposal system. Making cryptocurrency markets less volatile and projects more substantive is a matter of doing what we can to eliminate the information asymmetry that arises from technological complexity, both with investors and software alike.  Complexity for Investors  I have observed a very bimodal distribution when it comes to the extent to which cryptocurrency investors are informed. There is a minority that is incredibly well informed and a majority who are quite uninformed.  This knowledge gap often benefits the well-informed at the direct expense of the uninformed, so the former are incentivized to maintain this arrangement. Similar to many other markets, the less-informed chase the carrot of easy profits dangled in front of them by the better-informed. When this herd-like behavior is combined with relatively thinly traded markets, it creates serious volatility, which has much in common with over-the-counter (“OTC”) stocks.  The perception of value drives investor decision-making, so the collective psychological state of investors determines the value of an asset. Unlike many other assets, cryptocurrency fundamentals do not change substantially as a function of time. This constancy of fundamentals is a major driver for using cryptocurrencies as a store-of-value (“SoV”) over longer timescales.  It is this SoV property that separates cryptocurrencies from OTC stocks, and it drives a longer timescale periodicity that is not present in most OTC stocks. Many uninformed investors are keen to buy low and sell high, capturing a profit in fiat terms, whereas well-informed investors understand the SoV property is a longer term play, which incentivizes them to buy low and avoid liquidating their positions.  Informed investors using cryptocurrencies as a SoV fuel these longer term boom-bust cycles, so episodic spikes in valuation occur without the value crashing to zero after each manic buying phase.  Complexity for Projects  After managing several software projects over the past decade, I can say that, even as someone who participates on a technical level, it is easy to overpromise on deliverables.  The main driver of this disconnect between promises and quality working code is the hidden complexity of the cryptocurrency development process. Over the past few years, I have seen many projects make massive promises and raise staggering amounts of capital in ICOs and similar processes, only to not deliver, deliver incredibly late or deliver barely-working software.  Similar to the situation for investors, projects have a bimodal distribution of technical ability: a minority that keeps their promises roughly in line with what they can realistically deliver and a majority that grossly overpromises on a regular basis. Overpromising on software deliverables is often the result of a combination of underestimating the complexity of cryptocurrency software and conscious overstatement on part of project leads.  Because the domain of cryptocurrency software is still rather new and complex, there are correspondingly few people who are well-suited to understand what can and cannot be achieved in a particular amount of time, on a technical basis. So, a project may make some really impressive claims about what it will achieve, but when there are so few people who are capable of realistically assessing how feasible the claims are, it incentivizes malicious actors to bait-and-switch investors.  Numerous projects that have been funded on a bait-and-switch basis have seen their valuations collapse throughout 2017 and 2018 once investors become aware they are unlikely to deliver on their claims.  Complexity in Practice  As the Project Lead for Decred, I am familiar with the process of dealing with complexity from a technical and management standpoint, and our off-chain time-ordered filesystem, Politeia, serves as a good example for how hidden complexity can delay even seasoned development teams in the space.  Our goal was to have Politeia in production as our proposal system in roughly 12 months from the start of the project in April 2017, and we didn’t go into production until six months after the projected date in October 2018. Despite building on top of a working versioned filesystem, git and attempting to avoid complexity, it still took several additional months to get the metadata formats just right and have the frontend perform suitably.  Politeia is based on a pretty simple idea “create an off-chain store of data where you can demonstrate who said what when using cryptography and an existing blockchain.""  Once you split this apart into its components, it doesn’t seem very difficult:  Make episodic self-contained timestamps using the Decred blockchain  User identities correspond to keypairs in a PKI system  User messages are all signed by the corresponding identity private key  Up and down votes are a special form of user message  Tracking user ticket votes based on snapshots of the Decred ticket pool  This list is pretty short and each component is relatively simple, but handling the edge and corner cases that arise between these components quickly becomes non-trivial. Despite the final working implementation being complex, it can be described as a handful of simple components that even less-informed market participants can understand.  Simplicity for Investors  There are myriad ways to become a well-informed cryptocurrency investor, but after making my own missteps, I have a few simple policies that can help cut through some of the complexity:  Stay skeptical – When someone makes extraordinary claims, they need to supply extraordinary evidence. If any claim made by a project sounds too good to be true, see what someone external to that project has to say about it, and attempt to understand more about how they will deliver on their claim.  Do your own research – There is no substitute for doing some self-directed research about a project before investing in it. Even in my case, as someone who has been working in the space for almost six years, it still takes me several hours to do a good job footprinting another project and understanding their value proposition in some detail. Are there other projects that serve a similar niche? What makes this project better than others in the same niche?  Dollar-cost averaging – Not everyone has the ability to dictate the schedule on which they acquire cryptocurrency, but I recommend considering a dollar-cost averaging approach, where you make regular purchases over a longer time period. It is challenging to buy at a local minimum price, so rather than load up at single price, you purchase regularly over a wide range of prices. This way, you are not beholden to the psychology of having bought everything at a single price, and you can lower your average acquisition cost by buying as prices drop.  Psychological periodicity – As discussed above, there is a periodicity present in cryptocurrency markets that is not present in other similar markets. Before investing, consider that you may have to wait several years for the market to cycle to a point where you have made a good investment. 2018 has had a lot of similarity to 2014 in that all-time highs occurred near the start of the year and markets have sold off in stages throughout the year. For much of 2015, BTC/USD was in the 200s and this was an excellent time to acquire Bitcoin. I suspect 2019 will be similar to 2015, where valuations stay depressed and the market consolidates throughout the year.  Simplicity for Projects  Overcoming the complexity barrier between promises and implementation for cryptocurrency projects is challenging. Here are some policies that have served me well:  Avoid overpromising – It is easy to be coerced or otherwise convinced that you need to make huge promises to generate interest in your project, financial or otherwise. If you care about not looking like a doofus later on, make a point to reflect on whether or not your promises can be delivered on before making them publicly. In my case, this has meant not publishing projected completion dates for work because I am often wrong about when it ends up being done, e.g. Politeia. Managing expectations matters.  Avoid complexity – Once you have some established promises or have otherwise chosen a path forward to address a technical problem, do what you can to avoid complexity and still achieve your goal. Cryptocurrency software is often, as a function of the domain, quite complex, so it especially important to keep things as simple as possible. Less complexity means you are more likely to deliver your software sooner.  Conclusion  By working together to increase our collective comprehension, participants in the cryptocurrency ecosystem can take many steps to help reduce market volatility, create more substantive technology, and efficiently educate newcomers.  If 2019 is anything like 2015, the cryptocurrency market is in a consolidation phase, and the next several months will continue to shake out underperforming projects. Very little has changed with the fundamentals of the space, despite the pullback in valuations, so I expect a continued and bright future for cryptocurrencies in 2019 and beyond.
