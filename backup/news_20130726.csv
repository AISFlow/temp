42425046,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHq35h,1374851998,"Uniting the globe, reigniting old scams, and the power of hungry geeks","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 26th July 2013 — a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law    Too good to be true - and those are just the names    The marvellously named Trendon T. Shavers from Texas has had his collar felt by the American authorities. They accuse him of running a Ponzi scheme under the guise of Bitcoin Savings and Trust, which turned millions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin into fun for him and misery for his investors.      Ponzi schemes are simple: you promise huge returns on investment but use new investors to pay off old ones at your promised rate. It works wonderfully as long as new money keeps coming in fast enough, and nobody tries to take their investments out - but the longer you run it, the bigger the financial hole. This is, of course, massively illegal (unless you’re a national government, in which case it’s called prudent financial engineering).      Such schemes are very old - Dickens wrote about them - but the classic of the art was one concocted by the even more marvellously named Carlo Pietro Giovanni Guglielmo Tebaldo Ponzi. An Italian immigrant to the US at the start of the 20th century, he went through various petty frauds and thievery before discovering that you could buy international postage coupons in Europe and redeem them in the US for many times their original value. That wasn’t illegal - but you couldn’t do it in bulk. That detail escaped Ponzi’s attention, at least until he’d got hundreds of investors in on the scheme and promised them huge returns - so he paid them from the new investors who flocked in as the old ones were paid. Eventually, it all came thundering down amid huge publicity and Carlo’s fame was assured. Albeit not perhaps as he may have wished.      There have been plenty of other Ponzi schemes since then, based on the principle that there’s a sucker born every minute. So why the connection to bitcoin? The only reason bitcoin is chosen for such activities is that it’s new and has recently undergone a dramatic increase in value, and has thus attracted a lot of credulous punters. As with gambling, anyone with a basic grasp of integer mathematics and basic statistics will be able to spot and avoid the worst excesses of the rip-off merchants with ease. Another sign that something needs a little extra scrutiny is if the underlying mechanism is kept secret - as it was with Bitcoin Savings And Trust.      Shavers refused to divulge this for the reason that if he did, it would stop working. In that, at least, he told nothing but the truth.    Gains without frontiers as BTC becomes the world wide wonga    There have always been global currencies. For most of the last hundred years, the US dollar has been the de facto dosh accepted anywhere in exchange for goods and services' real value, and it’s not really under threat, even though the euro has made some inroads. But dollars have downsides. They are frequently counterfeited and in the strangest of places such as North Korea and, well, Dartmoor - where the young John Law worked for a chap who rented out fruit machines and arcade games. Said cross between a Wurzel and Arthur Daley was subsequently nabbed when the local plod found $100 printing plates and security paper under the floorboards of matey’s barn.      The other downside is that dollars are physical and open to being stolen, confiscated, mislaid or destroyed - all risks for anyone who habitually moves across borders, makes the acquaintance of people with guns and no sense of humour, or generally has an adventurous attitude to life.      Bitcoin, however, can live safely on the Internet, stashed quietly away in this or that online storage system - even in an email account - only to be summoned at will by its owner when required. Provided the details of where it’s stored are simple enough to be memorised, and that’s easy to arrange, the adventurous traveller doesn’t even need to carry technology with them. As long as a computer or smartphone can be borrowed at the time of transaction the money can be spirited out of nowhere and transferred.      Until customs, gangsters, robbers or governments learn to look inside our heads, this is going to be one of the safest ways to globetrot with transactable currency for the foreseeable future.      Good luck finding that bar in the ‘Stan, mind.    A wizard wheeze for hungry programmers    Fans of Terry Pratchett’s Discworld series will know it has sold many millions of copies in many languages, and is enjoyed by hordes of normal people who wouldn’t normally consider fantasy - let alone comedy fantasy - as wholesome faire. But as Pratchett himself has noted, whenever the series breaks into a new market around the world, it follows the same pattern. It’s picked up first by the hardcore fantasy mob, the sort with yards of bookshelf deoted to dragons and wizards, and in particular by the more techy geeks among them.      Bitcoin may be following the same path. Foodler, an online ordering system for restaurants, decided to add bitcoin to its system: not because of complex economic analysis and business model cogitation, but because Foodler was built by programmers. Programmers eat a lot of delivery Thai. And programmers think bitcoin is cool. Now, although the actual figures are low, the rate of growth in bitcoin transactions within the company is 30 percent a month - which is anything but low. And that’s not just programmers.      In retrospect, Foodler is an obvious candidate for bitcoin exploration. It can shield the restaurants from any need to handle BTC - instead, Foodler converts customer payments into credit and handles all of the bitcoin to dollar conversion. It’s an online service, bitcoin’s natural environment. And it has a huge customer base - some 11 million hungry clients - which is big enough for even a very minority interest to make sense.      So far, only around 270 bitcoins are spent in the system every month. And it’s far too facile to imagine that the 30 percent per month growth rate will continue indefinitely, but even in the short term, that means an increase of thirteen times per year. For something that didn’t take very long to implement, it’s been worth it in publicity terms alone - and yet another sign of cryptocurrency slipping into the mainstream.      And it didn’t even need a wizard with a big wand.    John Law  is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler. Having reformed the French economy, invented paper currency, state banks, the Mississippi Bubble and other ideas essential to modern economics, he took three hundred years off in a small cottage outside Bude.

42425038,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHq2ph,1374849418,Bitcoin-based Bitbetex wagers on peer-to-peer betting success,"Just days after SatoshiDice sold for almost $12 million, another bitcoin-based online betting site has started up, but with a key difference. Bitbetex is a peer-to-peer betting system, that allows anyone to bet on anything with someone else.  Currently in beta, the site works by allowing someone to offer a bet on pretty much anything (in the explainer video, someone bets on the outcome of a football match with Spain). When offering a bet, a person also chooses the odds. They can either back a bet (betting that something will happen), or they can lay a bet (betting that something won't happen).  Someone else perusing the list of available bets may decide to take up the offer, and lay down their money.  Tony Hatchett, who coded the website in PHP, explains that he chose to use bitcoin payment exclusively for the site to reduce the cost of placing bets.  ""Generally, fees of around 3% would need to be paid to a payment facilitator but bitcoin allows us to remove that overhead completely,"" he says. ""Secondly, bitcoin is globally accessible, which allows us to match a bet from someone in the UK to a bet placed by someone in the US for example. No complicated currency conversions are needed."" That's important for a site trying to gain traction and get as many respondents to its bets as possible.  This site joins a growing number of bitcoin betting exchanges. One of the closest to the Bitbetex model is BitBet, which also allows people to make their own bets. It offers bets in categories including politics, entertainment, and Bitcoin itself.  People on this site are offering bets on everything from Google's share price by October, through to who will declare candidacy for Texas governor next year.  However, most if not all bitcoin-based betting exchanges seem to offer betting pools, in which many people can wager on the outcome of a bet. Aside from increasing the betting volume, this betting model also serves as an opinion poll. For example, BitBet users wagered on whether Butterfly Labs would deliver ASIC devices before March 1, 2013, cheekily redirecting to the betting page from Josh-zerlan.com (Zerlan has been the public face of the company). 135 people gambled. 79% wagered a total of 898.52 BTC that BFL wouldn’t make the deadline, while 56% bet 791.28 BTCs that the firm would (they lost).  Similar sites include Bets of Bitcoin. On that site, 45% of the total money wagered is given to the bet winners based on the proportion of their bet. Another 45% goes to the winners, based on how early they placed their bet. Another 5% goes to the user who submitted the bet (we see an opportunity to make considerable amounts of cash there, with the right bet idea), while the site gets 5% commission.  Bitbetex also charges a standard 5% commission on the profits from a bet. Loyal members will begin getting discounts, going as low as 3%, says Hatch, adding that it will also run some bets at 0% commission, presumably to encourage interest in the site. It will ensure that bets are paid by acting as an escrow service, holding both stakes until the bet is settled.  BTCBet is one of several bitcoin-based sports books, while BitSaloon offers online casino and sports bets. Others follow the lottery system model, allowing people to bet on the bitcoin block chain itself, rather than the outcome of real-world sporting events. Bit Millions falls into this category.  “We will not allow bets on people dying, or on something that has implications for someone’s health or wellbeing,” Hatch adds.  Currently, the site is serving beta users with virtual coins, meaning that there is no real bitcoin payout on a bet. However, Hatch hopes to go live soon. “The date for beta hasn’t been officially set but we are very close to making a decision on this,” he says, adding that it is ""close to a production-ready state"".",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MINING | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/26/bitcoin-based-bitbetex-wagers-on-peer-to-peer-betting-success,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15171157b87b77f8ed65dde5904e61439cd724de-1024x646.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425034,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHq2lh,1374836296,Bitcoin payment processor BIPS abandons Mt. Gox for Bitstamp,"Adding to the strife over at Mt. Gox, payment processor BIPS has abandoned the exchange, instead signing with Bitstamp.  BIPS is a two-year-old payment processor cited by Crunchbase as the largest provider of bitcoin payments in Europe. The Copenhagen-based firm, founded by Kris Henriksen, had been using Mt. Gox to convert between fiat currency and bitcoin. It threw in the towel with Mt. Gox early this week, explaining that the number of sell orders is increasing as merchants embrace bitcoin payments. Mt. Gox continues to be slow processing withdrawals, and is having problems keeping up, BIPS explained.  Henriksen refused to provide statistics about the company's bitcoin processing volumes, or growth rate, other than to say ""quite a few,"" and ""very quickly"". But it does depend on a steady flow of conversion between bitcoin and fiat currency, he explained.  Dealing with Mt. Gox was becoming increasingly unworkable, he told CoinDesk. Withdrawal times were the biggest bugbear. ""In BIPS' case, each withdrawal had a pending period of over eight weeks. This was devastating on BIPS’ fiat buffer, as we process withdrawals in 1 to 5 business days,” he complained. Conversions between bitcoin and fiat currency is a basic business need for a payment processor.  Bitstamp  has promised to do it more quickly, and Henriksen expects this to happen in less than eight weeks.  The news just seems to get worse for Mt. Gox, and better for Bitstamp. The incumbent exchange has been losing market share following a series of technical and regulatory problems that have seen account seizures. This week, trading volumes on Bitstamp climbed above those on Mt. Gox for the first time.  The BIPS defection may be more of a symbolic win for Bitstamp, and unlikely to boost market share significantly for the exchange, though, Henriksen says. “However, in the long run it would probably benefit both of the companies. And as I met the Bitstamp team in San Jose, I am more inclined to trust them than Mt. Gox.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/26/bitcoin-payment-processor-bips-abandons-mt-gox-for-bitstamp,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c988047780139de432b2ae5480372ec20bb816a-754x400.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
