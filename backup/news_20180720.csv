42401663,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd23YC,1532124273,Who's In Control of Tezos? That Answer Is About to Change,"""To me, it kind of feels similar to the beginning of ethereum.""  Andrew Paulicek, founder of Happy Tezos, isn't the only one excited about the upcoming milestone in the life of Tezos, a blockchain network that launched three weeks ago after a series of long, painful delays.  Every three days or so – the exact intervals vary – Tezos enters a new ""cycle."" At some point this weekend, likely Saturday, it will cross the threshold into cycle number seven.  When that happens, the Tezos Foundation, the entity that conducted Tezos' initial coin offering (ICO) last year and launched the network at the end of June, will give up sole control of the Tezos blockchain. With this change, both the first generation of Tezos startups and its token holders will have roles to play in the network.  Since launch, every one of Tezos' eight ""bakers"" – validators who serve a similar function to miners in other blockchains – has been controlled by the foundation, as this page shows.  With the beginning of the next cycle, the opportunity to ""bake"" will open up to the broader community, and Tezos will begin to assume something closer to the final, decentralized form its founders envisioned.  Like EOS, the Tezos network reaches consensus about the state of the blockchain using delegated proof-of-stake, rather than the proof-of-work system familiar to bitcoin and ethereum. Instead of crunching through hashes to find a new block of transactions, as in mining, the process is a kind of randomized voting system known as validating or, in Tezos' bread-themed jargon, baking.  The bake-off  Unlike EOS, however, validators are not chosen through elections.  The way Tezos' system works, only nodes with a ""roll"" of 10,000 XTZ (""tez"") tokens can bake. Ordinary users who lack the funds can delegate tokens to professional services to do it for them, however. That way, users earn subsidies from the network, minus any fees charged by bakers.  A few of these professional delegates (Happy Tezos is one, though it will not be participating in the first cycle of baking) will be making their debut in the next cycle, though foundation nodes will continue to bake the vast majority of blocks for at least a few weeks. According to a spreadsheet shared with CoinDesk by one of these independent delegation services, the foundation will initially find around 80 percent of blocks, but that proportion will drop off rapidly as more bakers come online.  ""A very small percentage of the overall community-run bakeries and tokens are actually going to be baking tomorrow,"" Jonas Lamis, business lead at the delegation service Tezos Community, told CoinDesk, adding:  ""That's just going to continue to ramp up every cycle.""  The excitement is palpable at the delegation services CoinDesk spoke to – in part, no doubt, because they will soon be earning fees from baking.  ""This is the moment everybody's been waiting for,"" Bo Byrd, founder of the delegation service Tezzigator, said. His co-founder, Josh Brown, said, ""We're definitely going to be watching when the ball drops.""  Trust me  It would appear the token holders share the delegation services' enthusiasm.  ""We're thrilled to see the level of participation in baking,"" a Tezos Foundation spokesperson told CoinDesk, adding: ""over 96 percent of the tokens activated are taking part in baking or delegation.""  In fairness, there's not much else to do with tez in the absence of decentralized applications on the platform.  Especially since holders can move their delegated tokens at any time – there is no minimum period for which they must be staked – there would appear to be little risk in delegating tez and earning what amounts to interest from the block subsidies.  Then again, tez holders should choose their delegation services wisely. Every service CoinDesk spoke to, as well as the Tezos Foundation, said the same thing: the relationship between token-holder and baker is not governed by smart contracts, but rather is ""off-chain"" – at least for the time being.  In other words, clients need to trust that the delegation services they sign up for will pay them what they're owed, and not charge higher fees than advertised. In contrast to bitcoin mining, Lamis said, as a Tezos baker:  ""You have to be a politician and a customer support person and a technologist to be able to pull it off.""  As this nascent market gets underway, one of the biggest challenges will be transparency and access to information. Lamis said that he depended on ""tribal knowledge"" gleaned from forums and conversations with Tezos developers.  But ""as far as digesting all this technical information and making it explainable,"" he added, that's going to be a job for the community over the coming year. It might not be easy, he concluded:  ""I think this is a whole new level of geekiness.""

In a blog post, published on July 19, the site said that it had already dropped a minimum volume requirement for exchanges listed on the site, a policy it said was originally pursued ""in order to filter for more popular exchanges that could be listed on CoinMarketCap.""  The site also plans to introduce new filters and ranking metrics in a bid to give users ""the power to experience and use the data in a way that fits their needs most.""  The announcement followed a post on CryptoExchangeRankings, which tackled the question of how relatively new exchanges were able to move up CMC's volume rankings.

CMC's vice president of marketing Carylyne Chan wrote in the site's post that it may show high trading volumes due to the way it gathers data from exchanges.  In particular, transaction mining, low fees and wash trading on the part of crypto projects might result in artificially high trade volumes appearing on the site.  Chan wrote:  ""While we have a relationship with most of the exchanges listed on our site, there is no guarantee that any of them will respond or comply to any specific guidelines, but we have to continue showing users the best approximation of price and volume based on all the data we have available. The evolution of new models such as transaction mining also means that there needs to be new ways to account for volume. Compounding it is the fact that they are, in fact, enabling greater liquidity in the way that users are trading more readily on the platforms.""  CMC is designed around aggregating data sent to it by exchanges, and so the numbers on the site reflect ""the best approximation of price and volume based on all the data we have available,"" she said, explaining that ""even though we try our best to verify the data with the exchanges on our site, we are not in the practice of censoring or policing others.""

42401669,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd23ZB,1532106009,$8K In Reach? 4 Barriers Await Emboldened Bitcoin Bulls,"$8,000? It's not out of the question.  With no price pullback happening in the wake of Tuesday's sudden surge, the technical charts indicate bitcoin could soon close in on this key psychological benchmark.  First, an expected pullback was not without merit (the charts were looking overextended on Tuesday when the 4-hour RSI reached its highest level since 2016), but since Wednesday, the world's largest cryptocurrency has largely consolidated gains in a narrow range between $7,246 and $7,588.  As the trading range tightens and the technical indicators regain composure, the probability of bullish continuation increases. At press time, the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index shows bitcoin is changing hands at $$7484.06 up 0.18 percent on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart  Bitcoin (BTC) has been in a clear consolidation mode since the conclusion of Tuesday's rally, but the daily bias remains bullish. Price is sitting comfortably above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline ($7,838) and three of the four important exponential moving averages (EMAs) are trending positively – maintaining the bullish view.  The 12-day and 50-day EMAs are nearing a bullish cross while the 100-day EMA is beginning to curve upward, which implies a bullish setup. What's more, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), an indicator used to measure buy and sell pressure, is still printing levels in bullish favor.  A bullish rally will not be an easy feat however since heavy resistance lies in the $7,600-$7,800 range.  The resistance zone includes four strong technical hurdles:  Prior price resistance (Early June)  100-day EMA  0.5 Retracement from May high of $9,900  Prior pennant support turned resistance.  Another reason for bulls to proceed with caution is the RSI approaching overbought conditions. While the RSI (currently 68) is capable of reaching much higher levels (it hit 93 in December 2017), a level of just 70 halted the previous substantial bullish rally in April.  The hourly chart paints a clearer picture of the post-rally consolidation taking place.  Hourly Chart        What started as choppy hourly consolidation morphed into a pennant-like structure, composed of a ""higher-low, lower-high pattern.""  The pennant formation (continuation pattern) supplemented by price sitting above all four hourly EMAs and the 0.382 Fibonacci Retracement (from May high), as well as the hourly RSI beginning to trend upwards, creates a rather clear short-term bullish bias.  As the trading range continues to narrow, the closer BTC is to a breakout. A bullish rally would first likely test the larger pennant resistance (blue line) followed by the upper boundary of the resistance zone mentioned in the daily chart, $7874 (0.5 retracement).  View:  Bitcoin's consolidation since Wednesday has allowed the overextended short-term indicators to cool off, preparing itself for another move - short-term charts suggest to the upside near $8000.  If a bearish correction occurs, the rising hourly EMAs should provide a safety net of temporary support.  The short-term bullish view will only be negated if price finds acceptance below the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline of $6,838.    Article Update: (17:20 UTC)      While publishing this analysis, the hourly pennant pattern shown above broke bullish and the price of bitcoin rose to $7657 (BPI). That said, price harshly rejected from the mentioned larger pennant resistance - now trading at $7383. The higher low pattern is still intact but the price will look to find short-term support on hourly EMAs in case of further breakdown.

A final hearing on the ban's merits has been deferred to September 11, local news outlet Inc42 reported Friday. The panel of judges overseeing the case want all arguments and submissions from both the RBI and the ban's critics to be submitted by that day. While it is not clear when a decision will be made, Rashmi Deshpande, a lawyer representing Kali Digital, which runs an exchange, said she expects the Supreme Court to ""dispose of the case"" the same day.  The ban began in April, when the RBI announced that regulated financial institutions would be prohibited from servicing cryptocurrency exchanges and other related businesses. The Supreme Court upheld the ban earlier this month pending Friday's hearing.  Though the scheduled hearing was expected to include all final arguments to the case, the fact that certain organizations, including the Securities and Exchange Board of India, have not submitted their evidence resulted in the delay.  Speaking to Quartz India, Deshpande remained hopeful about the matter, saying:  ""Our expectation is that the hearing will be on the basis of merit where we get to present the case on why the RBI circular is unconstitutional and should be quashed.""  At the same time, it was reported by the Bar and Bench that a senior advocate representing RBI said in today's hearing that ""the policy of RBI is of extreme caution,"" adding that cryptocurrencies had the potential to encourage illegal transactions.

The FSC said the new department – dubbed the Financial Innovation Bureau – will focus on developing policy-making initiatives for the domestic blockchain and fintech industry, The Korea Times reported on Thursday.  An FSC official was cited as saying:  ""The new Financial Innovation Bureau will ... be tasked with policy initiatives for financial innovation, such as innovating financial services using fintech or big data, and responses to new developments and challenges such as cryptocurrencies.""  Perhaps surprisingly, though, the body will exist only temporarily, with a two-year lifespan.  The decision to set up the temporary bureau was reportedly made during a meeting of financial regulators and the Ministry of the Interior and Safety.  ""The FSC plans a major organizational reshuffle to better protect financial consumers and proactively respond to financial innovation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution era,"" said the FSC official.  The move by the finance regulator come amid a growing effort in the country to develop new laws to regulate the blockchain industry after somewhat knee-jerk reactions in the past.  Notably, South Korea outlawed initial coin offerings last year. However, in May, the nation's legislative arm of government pushed for the removal of the ban, officially proposing legislation to permit ICOs as long as investor protections are put in place.  Earlier this month, it was also reported that members of different political parties are expected to submit bills focused on regulating cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings and blockchain.

The company – which manufactures components for bitcoin mining chip makers, including Bitmain – made the prediction as it announced its second-quarter results, reporting $7.85 billion in revenue. That figure represents a decline of 7.2 percent from the previous quarter but an increase of 11.2 percent compared to the same period in 2017.  In statements, an official from the company quarter cited ""strong"" demand from cryptocurrency miners, but suggested that TSMC sees this state of affairs changing in the months ahead.  ""Our second quarter business was mainly impacted by the mobile product seasonality, while the continuing strong demand from cryptocurrency mining and a more favorable currency exchange rate moderated the mobile softness,"" Lora Ho, senior vice president and chief financial officer, was quoted as saying.  She added:  ""Moving into third quarter 2018, we anticipate our business will benefit from new product launches using TSMC 7-nanometer technology while cryptocurrency mining demand will decrease from second quarter.""  It's a notable statement, given that in January, TSMC said it expected robust demand to continue. Indeed, in April, the company reported that cryptocurrency mining-related services had boosted its revenues to record highs.  ""We see very strong demand in the first quarter from cryptocurrencies.

FinanceFeeds  indicated Thursday that, according to a document submitted by Montroll's legal counsel, ""a plea agreement agreed upon in principle and expected to be finalized and entered by July 23"" has accelerated efforts to reach a final court resolution.  Back in February, Montroll was hit with a number of charges for operating what the SEC said was an ""unregistered securities exchange"" and allegedly using the platform to defraud users of their cryptocurrency.  Separately, Montroll is accused of perjury and obstruction of justice over his failure to report a hack of his second business, WeExchange, in 2013. The breach ultimately saw roughly 6,000 bitcoins stolen – now worth some $68.7 million. The accused reportedly transferred some of his own cryptocurrency holdings to the exchange in an attempt to conceal the losses.  According to the New York Attorneys Office, William F. Sweeney Jr., FBI assistant director-in-charge, commented:  ""As alleged, Montroll committed a serious crime when he lied to the SEC during sworn testimony. In an attempt to cover up the results of a hack that exploited weaknesses in the programming code of his company, he allegedly went to great lengths to prove the balance of bitcoins available to BitFunder users in the WeExchange Wallet was sufficient to cover the money owed to investors. It's said that honesty is always the best policy – this is yet another case in which this virtue holds true.""

42401651,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd23LP,1532088014,Bitcoin's Biggest Startups Are Backing a New Effort to Keep Fees Low,"2017 was a wake-up call for bitcoin supporters to say the least.  With so many people using the software amid a price boom, the fees for sending transactions swelled higher than ever before, even rising to as much as an average of $26 for a single transaction. It was a road with too many cars, leading to a veritable traffic jam.  Sure, the situation wasn't long to last, as fees fell back to manageable levels, but the worry is this spike could always happen again – if, or dare we say it, when, bitcoin ""goes mainstream.""  But fees don't have to be as high next time there's a spike in the cryptocurrency's use, at least that's the argument being put forward by those launching a new effort called Bitcoin Optech.  Led by bitcoin developer and Bitcoin Core contributor John Newbery, the effort is an attempt to help the companies that rely on the bitcoin software figure out what scaling technologies they're missing, including those that will push fees lower.  Newbery told CoinDesk:  ""Businesses were caught unawares. At the same time, there was lots of scaling tech that could have helped and that was well-understood, but they weren't adopted yet.""  That gave him the idea that developers with knowledge of bitcoin's underlying tech could be more aggressive in helping companies through such upgrades. For instance, the bug fix Segregated Witness (SegWit) activated last August, but bitcoin businesses were slow to adopt the change, even though it can cut fees by half.  Since it can help to improve the experience for all bitcoin users, many notable entities are interested in the effort, with investors Xapo CEO Wences Casares, entrepreneur John Pfeffer and bitcoin development group Chaincode Labs giving them the money to get the project off the ground.  The non-profit effort also boasts six member companies so far, including Coinbase, Square and BitGo, all who've expressed what they believe is a need for an effort like Bitcoin Optech.  ""By collaborating with leading engineers in this space, we'll be able to achieve more than we could have by tackling these problems alone,"" Coinbase lead bitcoin engineer Brock Miller said in a statement. Square strategic development lead Mike Brock said the company is ""proud"" to be working with Optech.  Coming together  So far, Bitcoin Optech has made contact with 15 to 20 bitcoin companies, saying they're surprised by how excited they are to adopt various scaling technologies. ""They're saying something like Optech has been missing. and could be beneficial. It's even bringing people together,"" Newbery said.  In this way, it's also helping heal relations between the various groups that have sprung up to support the decentralized bitcoin software. In the worst parts of bitcoin's history, a rift has emerged between developers of the Bitcoin Core protocol and the industry's companies, with the two different groups advocating for very different technical upgrades.  ""The more engagement there is between industry and open source, the better,"" Optech's announcement blog post explains.  To that end, they've identified a few key technologies that they can help business with right now.  Coin selection  is a complicated problem dealing with the most efficient way of choosing which ""coins"" to send when a bitcoin users sends a transaction. Adding to the complexity, Bitcoin OpTech project manager Steve Lee stressed that the best selection technique often varies from wallet to wallet.  While ""fee estimation"" is another technical problem that's hard to get right. Fee estimation tools in bitcoin wallets today often tell users they should pay fees much higher than they actually need to be paying.  Speaking about these very strategies, the Bitcoin Optech team, joined by Bitcoin Core contributor Andrew Chow, held their first workshop in San Francisco. Sponsored by Square, the event saw the developers go over some of these scaling technologies and what's in it for the companies that adopt them.  Lee called this workshop a ""good proof point"" for what they're doing in that more companies showed up than they could have hoped for. Six of the eight San Francisco companies they broached the topic to showed up at the workshop, demonstrating, in his mind, how hungry engineers at these companies are to learn about how to solve these types of problems.  ""It's hard to get their attention,"" he said.  Catalyzing change  The Bitcoin Optech team stressed, though, that they don't want to be any sort of ""central authority"" telling bitcoin companies what they should and shouldn't do.  Lee said they're looking to be more of a ""catalyst"" for change.  By hosting more workshops similar to the above around the world, hopefully to give engineers the tools they need to make these scaling technologies on their own.  Meanwhile, they've been sending out weekly newsletters describing the most recent additions to Bitcoin Core, the most popular bitcoin client. And they have other ideas too, like creating a Slack group where member companies can keep in touch.  Another example of this is they're looking to start what Lee calls an open-source ""cookbook,"" detailing various scaling changes bitcoin companies can adopt.  This documentation would be available to anyone, not just dues-paying members.  All that said, there's a focus to Bitcoin Optech's mission: technologies that businesses can add today  Maybe someday they'll help companies other much-hyped technologies, such as lightning or Schnorr, since many bitcoin companies need to update their software in order to support these improvements.  But Newbery said that might be a while. They're waiting until ""they're more advanced in their proposals."" Until then, they'll be focused on well-understood strategies that bitcoin companies have yet to adopt.

42381052,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93PSR,1532084426,Police Force Confiscates 295 Bitcoins from Criminal in UK First,"A British county police force has become the first in the country to seize and exchange bitcoins discovered during a criminal investigation.  According to a report from the Financial Times yesterday, the Surrey police force obtained 295 bitcoins last October after arresting a Latvian man called Seregjs Teresko, who has since been convicted for money laundering and sentenced to nine years in prison.  The force further sold the assets for around $1.5 million following a court hearing at the time. Back then, the price of a bitcoin was around $5,000, but shot up to its all-time high of around $20,000 just two months later.  A local court ruled on Thursday that the Surrey police force is entitled to confiscate the bitcoins seized from Teresko, the FT says. The force is further allowed to keep 18.8 percent of the proceeds – approximately £273,000 – that will go towards its operational budget.  The report describes how, after obtaining the money launderer's private key to the bitcoin holdings, the police force subsequently set up its own digital wallet and reportedly used an overseas cryptocurrency exchange to liquidate the assets.  The news comes as a time when law enforcement agencies in the U.K. are beefing up their knowledge about cryptocurrency in an effort to better investigate crimes that involve the technology, as well as to more easily seize such assets.  Last year, a research office backed by a group of U.K. law enforcement groups proposed changing the country's laws to make seizing bitcoin easier. The N8 Policing Research Partnership said at the time it aimed to increase institutional knowledge about cryptocurrency among British police officials via a broad training initiative.

42381056,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93PcV,1532079054,Financial Exchange Thinks Blockchain Can Keep Online Auctions Fair,"A state-backed financial asset exchange in China's Chongqing city is turning to blockchain to make online auctions tamper-proof and transparent.  According to a patent application filed in December and revealed on Friday by the China State Intellectual Property Office, the Chongqing Financial Asset Exchange (CQFAE) is exploring how to create a system that allows multiple parties to bid for a financial asset over a distributed network.  The document explains that the envisioned network would be run by invited validator nodes that are separate from the companies who participate in bidding for certain assets, such as letters of credit or corporate bonds.  When companies submit their bid to the network, the validator nodes authentic the data and then broadcast the new price for the next level of the auction, which is calculated based on various criteria encoded to smart contracts on the blockchain.  The asset exchange said the effort is necessary because the existing centralized database system is vulnerable to malicious alteration of data, either by bidding parties or even auction organizers.  It stated in the patent filing:  ""The centralized online platform could make the bidding process become unfair and less transparent as the bidding parties are also unable to supervise the process. As such, the authenticity and security of the bidding data can't be guaranteed.""  Founded in 2011 as an authorized exchange by the municipal government of Chongqing, the CQFAE functions as an intermediary between small businesses looking to raise capital and lenders such as investment firms and traditional banks. It further facilitates the trading of corporate loans and letters of credit.  While it's so far unclear if the firm plans a blockchain product based on the patent application, it notably comes a month after the Chongqing city government revealed its plan to create a ""blockchain digital asset exchange.""  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the news initially caused confusion in the Chinese cryptocurrency community, which speculated that it could mean a government-backed cryptocurrency trading platform.

42381048,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93PRB,1532073616,The 'Dark DAO' Threat: Vote Vulnerability Could Undermine Crypto Elections,"Malicious cartels just might be lurking on your blockchain.  At least, that's the latest finding from Cornell University researchers Philip Daian, Tyler Kell, Ian Miers and Ari Juels, who reached the conclusion in a paper published last week on a vote manipulation scheme it termed a dark decentralized autonomous organization, or ""dark DAO.""  Describing the dark DAO as an entity set up using smart contracts, it would be undetectable, buying users votes in order to overwhelm governance systems, issue false signals or engage in market manipulation. According to the paper, such an attack would have far reaching-consequences in that it's applicable to any project that uses a form of governance in which those who own the coins would have a say in decisions.  Adding weight to the finding, is that this distinction applies to an increasingly large amount of cryptocurrencies, including those with valuations in the billions.  Projects like EOS, Tezos, Tron, Decred and Polkadot, for instance, have all deployed various forms of blockchain voting in an effort to formalize decision-making on their software.  Several of these systems rely on a technology called delegated proof-of-stake, which requires a certain number of nodes to be chosen to validate transactions on the network. As such, token holders are allowed to stake their coins - basically posting them to the blockchain to prove they control them - in an effort to make their votes go further.  Others seek to overcome the governance hurdles faced by major blockchains by allowing stakeholders to vote on technical changes – or what Tezos calls a ""self-amending crypto ledger.""  And while some of these projects have already hit roadblocks in their experimentation, according to the Cornell researchers, a dark DAO could cause havoc in a way that surpasses what's happened in the past.  ""The whole decentralization enterprise is founded on democratic ideals, so voting seems a natural governance mechanism,"" Juels told CoinDesk. ""Unfortunately, it's hard to get right and until a catastrophe occurs, people tend to assume that theoretical problems won't materialize.""  The co-author pointed to The DAO hack in 2016, where a malicious user drained 3.6 million ether from the first DAO built on ethereum, adding:  ""In a post-2016 world, the fact that election systems can and will be subverted should be crystal clear.""  Past precedent  According to the researchers, this particular dilemma is another case where entrepreneurs in the blockchains space seem to be turning a blind eye to past analysis.  Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and ethereum researcher Vlad Zamfir, for example, have criticized on-chain voting mechanisms as ""plutocracies,"" whereby the wealthy – those that own more coins – rule.  The paper states:  ""The blockchain space today, with predictable results, continues its tradition of ignoring decades of study and instead opts to implement the most naive possible form of voting.""  According to the paper, a dark DAO works by essentially dominating voter participation, which is especially disconcerting since many of these votes have suffered from low turnout.  One of the ""attack flavors"" the paper describes is that of the impact of ""trusted hardware."" Because such hardware allows computation to occur in an ""enclave"" or private setting during which time it's still submitting proofs, the authors argue this would allow nefarious actors to participate in the attacks without their identity being revealed.  This also means that the manipulated votes couldn't be detected either.  ""Potentially nobody, not even the DAO's creator, can determine the DAO's number of participants, the total amount of money pledged to the attack or the precise logic of the attack,"" the paper states.  Such a cartel could overwhelm a cryptocurrency, ""covertly collecting coins until it reaches some hidden threshold, and then telling its members to short the currency,"" it continues.  More attacks  But that's not to say that systems different than those employed by on-chain governance blockchains are particularly safe either.  For instance, the researchers also detail a bribery attack that could be committed against ethereum's signaling tool, called Carbon Vote. (A proof of concept for the attack was published to correspond to the release of the paper.)  In this example, a smart contract simply offers to buy votes and can do this in a private or a public way.  The blog post warns that as blockchains begin communicating with each other – also known as interoperability – such incentive-based attacks between competing blockchains are likely to become more frequent.  ""In a world with only one smart contract system, ethereum, internal incentives may lead to stable equilibria,"" the paper states, adding:  ""With two players, and the underdog incentivized to launch a bribery attack to destroy their competitors, such equilibria can be disrupted, changed and destroyed.""  While Jake Yocom-Piatt from Decred acknowledges that these kinds of attacks stand to be highly problematic in the future, the issue is one for both systems that deploy both on-chain and off-chain voting mechanisms.  He told CoinDesk: ""It is difficult to defend against vote buying, and it is currently an open research topic how to best defend against it.""  Mitigating the threat  Speaking to CoinDesk, representatives from several on-chain governance projects – Decred, Polkadot and Tezos – said a crucial defense strategy is to raise the cost of attack.  Arthur Breitman, co-founder of the Tezos project, said, ""At the end of the day, the only viable protection mechanism is ensuring that decisions involve sufficient skin in the game to ensure accountability to the network.""  Breitman also said that research into futarchy, in which decisions are made by future markets, could help on-chain governance going forward.  But according to the paper, the only defense against such attacks is more trusted hardware, ""to know a user has access to their own key material (and therefore cannot be coerced or bribed), some assurance is required that the user has seen their key.""  Still, Juels noted that the reliance on trusted hardware will seem ""anathema to a lot of the cryptocurrency community."" As such, he suggested the possibility of ""social mitigations"" or ""community-implemented deterrence to election subversion.""  However, he and Daian warned of the complexity here.  ""The mitigations for such threats are primarily social, in many cases imperfect, and in many cases likely complex enough to introduce additional vulnerabilities or attacks,"" Daian told CoinDesk.  According to Daian, oversights of this type are common within the industry:  ""In general, the blockchain space is extremely myopic: many of the ideas currently being put forward are not sustainable long-term, and only work because the systems being secured are either small or uninteresting to sufficiently motivated adversaries.""  Yet, the Cornell researchers plan to publish another article soon to discuss other available schemes that could eliminate, or at least diminish, the chance of these attacks being perpetrated.  Daian said, ""I would strongly caution against direct reliance on any voting scheme vulnerable to vote buying or coercion in decision making.""  Not scared of the dark  Still, while ominous, other researchers don't seem particularly fazed by the paper.  Griff Green from Giveth, an ethereum-based charity organization, said that little experimentation has gone into smart contract-based autonomous organizations since The DAO hack in 2016. As such, the likelihood that a group has created a dark DAO is slim, according to him.  ""DAOs are built to decentralize decision making across stakeholders over shared resources. If that shared resource is 'circumventing an on-chain election' then sure, of course, it might be done one day, but we don't even really have DAOs out in the wild yet,"" he told CoinDesk.  ""There is no foundation to really draw any conclusions on how DAOs can be used to circumvent other DAOs in their own elections,"" he continued, dismissing the paper as ""mental masturbation.""  Luke Duncan from Aragon, an ethereum application for building DAOs, seemed similarly calm.  While he admits the connotation around dark DAOs is negative, the industry is interested in protecting the privacy of organizations or individuals using the technology, so looked at in a different way, the research could point to positives.  He added:  ""With any of these powerful technologies there's how it can be used for useful applications and censorship resistance and then how people can use the same techniques to do more nefarious things.""

42381047,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93POf,1532066417,UK Begins Research on Law Reform for Use of Blockchain Smart Contracts,"The U.K. Law Commission has launched a research project investigating reforms that would bring legal clarity to the use of blockchain-based smart contracts.  According to a working paper published on Thursday, the independent agency has already this year carried out initial research on the topic and a more formal project is due to start in the summer. The agency said the work is to ""ensure that the law is sufficiently certain and flexible to apply in a global, digital context and to highlight any topics which lack clarity or certainty.""  ""There is a serious intention to take forward reform in this area,"" it added.  The Law Commission believes that smart contracts have the advantage of increasing ""trust and certainty"" and boost transaction efficiency among businesses. As such, the current legal system should adapt to the nascent technology to make the U.K. attractive for enterprises, it argued.  The working paper states:  ""It is important to ensure that English courts and law remain a competitive choice for business. Therefore, there is a compelling case for a Law Commission scoping study to review the current English legal framework as it applies to smart contracts.""  The effort follows a report published by the commission in December 2017 which outlined 14 areas – including the use of smart contracts – that are set for law reform after a year-long public consultation process.  The commission said at the time that the smart contract research process could take 9–18 months to complete, adding:  ""There are questions about how this feature (smart contract) would interact with contract law concepts such as implied terms or contracts which are held to have been void from the outset. There are also questions about data protection law.""

The world's fourth-largest telecom provider details how it could use the application to store contracts without allowing for documents to be tampered with. As outlined, the system would use a blockchain to both encrypt the contract, as well as store it in a decentralized manner, which can simplify the process by which it is verified by removing the need for centralized management.  The ""receiver of a transaction on an issued contract"" would generate a new transaction able to be linked to an original ""contract transaction,"" written on a block in the chain.  The document explains:  ""The present invention uses a blockchain as evidence of a contract made among a plurality of parties. A contract here refers to a sales contract, a deed of transfer, an application, a consent agreement, or the like, and is a document describing the content of a contract made among two or more individuals or bodies.""  All parties wishing to be involved in the agreement would link transactions to this principal virtual ""contract transaction"" that would eventually be returned to ""the contract-issuing party to close the chain of transactions.""  Once closed, the patent explains there would be an ""agreement verification apparatus"" to ensure evidence of the contract on the blockchain is correct by comparing the public keys used for electronic signature at the start of the blockchain with the ones used at the end.  The whole system, according to Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, is ""a simple method… maintaining the mode of one electronic signature per transaction, and maintaining credibility.""  Being the fourth largest telephone operating company in the world with a valuation quoted to be at $94.2 billion by Michigan TechNews, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone did announce in a press release last year that emerging technologies such as blockchain were making information and communications technology needs increasingly ""more complex.""

42381057,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93PYj,1532044830,Credit Rating Firm Backs $8 Million Fundraise for Crypto Alternative,"A startup looking to build a credit scoring protocol on top of the recently-launched Ontology blockchain has raised $8 million in seed funding.  POINTS, founded in 2017, said it drew funding from a mix of traditional venture capitalists including Danhua Capital and Ceyuan Ventures, a backer of OKCoin. Other participants in the seed round include the Ontology Foundation as well as Zhong Cheng Xin Credit Technology, China's first nationwide credit rating agency.  The new capital will be used to expand the company's engineering team in an effort to speed up its development of blockchain-based know-your-customer (KYC) and credit scoring applications. The idea is to build its protocol on top of a decentralized network and empower apps that can eliminate repetitive processes around identity.  Sarah Zhang, the founder and chief executive of POINTS, told CoinDesk:  ""Currently, whether it's for banking or registering at a crypto exchange, users need to repetitively upload their profiles. Meanwhile, institutions also need to repetitively conduct the KYC process manually, which is time-consuming and leads to a huge data storage on their ends.""  But instead of asking financial firms to be validators, who update and share a distributed ledger that contains user ID data, POINT's protocol incorporates another layer of a more centralized database to take up the role as a validator.  Key partnerships  To that end, Zhang said the company partnered with an IT firm called Teleinfo, which is is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology. The Academy is directly administrated by the Ministry of Industrial and Information Technology.  The partnership effectively gives POINTS the access to a database of 1 billion profiles of Chinese customers.  Zhang further explained:  ""When users voluntarily upload their information through the blockchain application, the database will validate that information ... and then timestamp and store validation results into the blockchain. Therefore, participating nodes such as banks will only see the validated results (for KYC) instead of the exact user details.""  In a similar way, POINTS is also charting the development of another blockchain-based application on top of its protocol for credit scoring in a move aimed to ""serve the unbanked.""  By partnering with its investor Zhong Cheng Xin, Zhang said the company also gains access to 500 million existing credit profiles provided by the rating agency.  With banks running as nodes on the blockchain, the database can extract credit data of a user from different institutions as well as from user's own submission, in order to compute a credit score, which is subsequently stored on the blockchain.  ""The end goal is to give a user a credit profile as complete as possible so that they can access to financial products that otherwise may not be available,"" she added.  And to incentivize user data submission, Zhang said the system will issue its own tokens but has not yet decided exact utility scenarios or whether the token can be traded.
