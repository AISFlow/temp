42432514,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNaGNh,1597701376,Nvidia Accused of Trying to Discredit Ex-Employee in Crypto Mining Revenue Trial,"Investors suing chipmaker giant Nvidia for allegedly misreporting the size of its crypto mining-related revenue have complained it is now trying to block key evidence from a former employee.    The group of shareholders said Thursday that Nvidia's lawyers had gotten the former employee, dubbed ""FE 5,"" to ""disavow"" several key statements and is now pushing for the whole testimony to be thrown out of court.  Having first brought charges in December 2018, the lawsuit alleges Nvidia downplayed the quantity of graphics cards – specifically GeForce GPUs – it was selling to cryptocurrency mining operations in order to buoy the stock price.  Nvidia has denied the accusations, claiming plaintiffs ""cherry-picked"" the data.  FE 5 gave evidence for an amended complaint in mid-May that appeared to show the chipmaker's executive team, including founder and CEO Jensen Huang, was regularly updated with figures of GeForce GPUs being bought by crypto miners.  FE 5 was head of Nvidia's consumer marketing in South Asia for five years until 2019.  Nvidia's lawyers informed plaintiffs in June they had identified and contacted FE 5, who had responded saying he/she had spoken under the misapprehension it was for research into the semi-conductor industry and not as evidence for a trial against the company.  Plaintiff's lawyers said they had clearly identified themselves from the start, and argue FE 5 is now giving these allegedly false statements out of fear Nvidia could retaliate against her/him.  Plaintiffs are calling on the court to strike down Nvidia's motion to dismiss evidence partly on the basis federal courts have rejected attempts by defendants to discredit the testimony from former employees in the past.

42432533,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNaGxh,1597696802,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Cracks $12.4K; DeFi Crosses $6B Locked,"Bitcoin made a major gain Monday while investors have locked over $6 billion in crypto into various DeFi services.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $12,332 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 4.1% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,774-$12,485  BTC slightly above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization opened the week with higher-than-normal volume pushing bitcoin to as high as $12,485. For some market observers it was only a matter of time before it happened.      Read More: Bitcoin Surges Past $12,000 to New 2020 High      “Bitcoin has been trading in a $11,000-$12,000 range for two weeks or so,” said Darius Sit, managing partner of Singapore-based QCP Capital. “It has been consolidating, threatening to break past $12,000, so this is not too surprising,” he added.      Thus far in August, Coinbase’s daily average bitcoin volume has been $182 million, but on Monday volume was at $245 million as of press time. “Unlike last week, today's attempt to break through the $12,000 level carried enough momentum to make a convincing break, sending BTC all the way to the $12,500 area,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research for crypto brokerage BeQuant.      William Purdy, an options trader and founder of analysis firm PurdyAlerts, says the derivatives market is showing where traders think bitcoin's price will be in the future as the cryptocurrency trends upward. “I think what is most interesting right now is how clear the upcoming expected price targets for bitcoin are via the option open interest,” he told CoinDesk, adding, “$12,000, $13,000, $14,100 and $16,000 are the spots with the greatest open interest, so the price is likely to settle on these as upcoming support/resistance.”      Read More: Bitcoin DeFi May Be Unstoppable: What Does It Look Like?

Yet, as the cryptocurrency exchange with the highest trading volume of ETC, OKEx acknowledged that removing ETC from trading would not be an easy decision to make, according to Jay Hao, chief executive of the exchange.      “Given ETC’s popularity and standing, we are not rushing into delisting,” Hao told CoinDesk in a Telegram message on Aug. 17. “However, they need to implement significant upgrades to the network to reduce the chances of another 51% attack happening.”      The Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange reimbursed all the lost ETC in full to its customers as part of its user-protection policy, according to a report published by OKEx on Saturday, and all deposits and withdrawals of ETC have been suspended due to the attacks.      Read more: Ethereum Classic’s Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Week      “We know that it is impossible to prevent a 51% attack on any decentralized exchange, but we also do not want to foot the bill for ETC’s security vulnerabilities that have made it particularly susceptible to attack(s),” said Hao.    Continued vulnerability    The recent 51% attacks on Ethereum Classic first occurred on Aug. 1 with total double-spending of $5.6 million worth of ETC. The second attack took place just five days later, losing about $1.68 million worth of ETC.      A 51% attack on a blockchain refers to a situation where one or more miners try to gain control of more than half of the mining power of the network. Compared with blockchains such as Bitcoin that have much a higher hashrate, blockchains with lower hashrates including Ethereum Classic are “more vulnerable” to this type of attack, according to OKEx’s report.      Read more: Crypto Long & Short: 51% Attacks and Open-Source Value      “It is evident that this breach in the blockchain’s secure functioning was due to a common problem with the Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains that have low global hashpower,” the report said. “... [T]his is certainly not limited to Ethereum Classic, which experienced a similar attack just last year. Other blockchains, such as Bitcoin Gold (BTG), have suffered such attacks in the past.”    Liquidity, and targeting OKEx    The exchange said in its report its only involvement in the attacks was the attackers used OKEx to purchase and trade ETC. This claim was a rebuttal to an analysis by blockchain analytics firm Bitquery, which alleged those wallets the attacker(s) used belonged to OKEx.      “As for why the attacker(s) chose OKEx in particular to purchase and trade their ETC, the most likely reason is liquidity,” the exchange said. “OKEx provides excellent ETC liquidity, seeing some of the largest ETC transaction volumes in the industry. This just means that the attacker(s) likely calculated that they would be able to relatively easily and promptly trade large amounts of ETC on OKEx.”      Similar to other exchanges, OKEx said it will increase the confirmation times for ETC deposits and withdrawals in the future.      The fate of Ethereum Classic has remained in question since the attacks. For now, 51% attacks are a reality for low-cap cryptocurrencies, ETC Coop Executive Director Bob Summerwill told CoinDesk, but options such as an emergency hard fork to a different hashing algorithm could help avoid future attacks.

42432523,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNaGXh,1597689019,An Open Letter to Our Dear Bankers: Be Brave,"Ouriel Ohayon is the CEO and co-founder of ZenGo crypto wallet.      Dear Banker,      We do not have many opportunities to speak about crypto, so I hope this will somehow reach you. It is time to have a meaningful conversation about both our worlds. I hope we can leave aside hostile arguments and unfounded beliefs and start a real conversation.      My message to you is simple: We need each other to build a brighter future. Crypto is not going to bury banks. On the other hand, banks are not going to be able to sustain their longtime approach to finance without adopting a new and radically innovative approach.      See also: Alex Mascioli – Don’t Expect Banks to Jump on the OCC Crypto Custody News    What is broken    The industry of finance and, in particular, that of remittances and money markets requires a digital-first approach. Pay close attention to your customers’ demographics. The latest generations live on their mobile screen and want everything here and now. Millions of people, including in the U.S., do not have access to modern banking services. In Latin America and Africa the trend is even more extreme.      In an era where electronic money can be sent at the speed of light, your customers are suffering unfair fees, delays and sub-par web services. This has led to the birth of an entire sub-industry of neo-banks (many of which are embracing crypto) that are more attractive to a younger generation in search of natural digital experiences.      As expectations for banking services change, so, too, do the fundamentals of your business model. This is not solely your fault. The rules of finance based on traditional monetary supply and fractional reserves, unchanged for decades, are reaching its limits. You pay the price for unchecked government power to print unlimited amounts of money, accumulating outstanding levels of debt. Someone certainly has to pay for it. Right?      See also: Why Ukraine Is Ripe for Cryptocurrency Adoption    Do not fear    It is natural to fear the new. The same happened 30 years ago when the internet arrived and traditional media and commerce companies laughed at the new toy, not thinking a network of machines could threaten their thriving business until it was too late.      There was a time, not so long ago, when running an internet connection in the U.S. was illegal. Until it was not. The internet has since become a pillar of modern existence. The reason is simple: It is better for the world because it is better for people.      Back to crypto. Let’s start with the most important part: Although it is new, owning and trading cryptocurrencies is not illegal. It is highly regulated and monitored by authorities.    Crypto may have begun as a heterodox experiment that indeed was used for all sorts of illicit purposes, but so much has changed. It is estimated that criminal use represents only 1% of all bitcoin transactions. But the same is true of any new technology and, as a reminder, fiat currencies and cash, in particular, are the prime choice for criminalshttps://www.tap.global/fiat-used-money-laundering-800x-crypto.    We get it, you need more familiarity with your security and risk standards. As a banker, you need to observe a certain set of know your customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) rules. But that has led you – certainly out of risk management and maybe fear – to abusively prevent entrepreneurs from opening a bank account, or block the proceeds of a trade when you find the MCC of the operator not to your liking.      See also: William Mougayar – While We Wait for Laws, We Need Better Interpretations of Existing Regulation      But know this: The crypto industry also applies rules of compliance. It is virtually impossible today to trade cryptocurrencies without a set of strict verifications.      Cryptocurrencies are being adopted by the day, morphing into a new field of limitless financial products and services that serve millions of people. But the crypto industry cannot grow alone, separated from legacy financial institutions and pipes. We already see the limitations.    Embrace crypto, build the future    Here is my message to you: Embrace this industry. Work with its people. Get to know them, not fear them. Start privately buying bitcoin today, try a crypto wallet and open your eyes. If you feel adventurous, try some decentralized financial apps (dapps) and borrow crypto or even cash with some of your cryptocurrencies. Understand this world.      You even have a legitimate reason to do so. Regulators in Germany, Korea and now the U.S. are letting banks custody digital assets. The regulatory framework is there for you to get started. Hop on the train, because if you do not, others will.    If your bank does not yet have a team studying this space, you are likely not working for the right company.    Some banks are already crypto first (like Signature and Evolve) and newer ones are coming that will be built on blockchain technologies and serve customers in the crypto space. While financial services geared towards millennials, such as Cash App, embraced crypto and have seen staggering growth.      The crypto industry needs banks to help build better and smoother services. We need help building real on-ramps and off-ramps with the freedom to move your funds seamlessly for non-technical people – not just “artificial ownership” as some are doing. (Robinhood and Revolut, I am looking at you.) Let’s work together to build better compliance systems that are simpler and safer, and create the real asset insurance services that are so needed.      No one is asking you to change everything overnight. Just start somewhere, learn continuously, explore the rabbit hole, do some pilots. Start with more familiar territories like custodial exchanges and U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins, which are in high demand everywhere.      You will be surprised by the ecosystem that is growing by the minute, and its unique opportunities. Your customers (and shareholders) will be happy to see you at the forefront of an emerging enterprise.      See also: Byrne Hobart – PTJ on BTC: Bitcoin Is Now the Macro Big Bet      If we are working together you could even make a substantial profit and re-build the foundation of your industry with lighter and more efficient rails. Lord knows that banks need to become more capital efficient. COVID-19 has made more evident what we already knew: Banks are spending and costing their customers too much. We also need money rails that are more efficient: ask those who were waiting for their stimulus checks.      And know this: you will not be alone. Follow Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, MicroStrategy , JPMorgan and more. Even high-profile finance executives once reluctant are coming around. And let’s not forget China has made digital currencies a national priority, being deployed as we speak.

42384447,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXQwV,1597680883,Blockchain Bites: Bitcoin on DeFi and DeFi on Bitcoin,"More bitcoins were tokenized than mined this Sunday, decentralized finance is coming to the Bitcoin system and a former Prudential Securities CEO thinks crypto is a safe bet.      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Bitcoin’s DeFi DG Lab recently open sourced its proposal for a decentralized finance (DeFi) product leveraging the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin is a growing part of the DeFi ecosystem, built primarily on top of Ethereum, as a tokenized asset. A number of firms including Bison Trails, Crypto Garage and Blockstream are all working on solutions to create a Bitcoin-specific DeFi ecosystem that wouldn't use representatives of bitcoin, but enable traders to do tasks directly with bitcoin, CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen reports.      Fund Rising Pantera Capital's Pantera Venture Fund III has more than doubled in size since it launched in 2018. The fund brought in $164.7 million in private placements from around 200 investors, according to a Form D filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Friday. Pantera had originally hoped to raise $175 million for Venture Fund III and said in March of last year it had crossed the $160 million milestone.      Aave’s Wave Decentralized money market Aave has released specifications for version two of its protocol as the project eyes $1 billion locked under contract, according to DeFi Pulse. Aave will partner with real estate tokenization firm RealT to bring home mortgages to DeFi. RealT did not return questions for comment by press time. As reported by CoinDesk, Aave announced plans to transition to a fully autonomous and decentralized protocol through its “genesis governance” and Aave Improvement Proposals (AIP) scheme.      Crypto Accounts Crypto payments startup Wyre is offering savings accounts that provide interest on crypto. Announced Friday, Wyre’s client list includes crypto custody firm Casa, wallet provider BRD and traditional enterprises such as banks. The new product’s interest rates are meant to be more stable than interest rates at crypto lenders because Wyre will manage funds between MakerDAO, Compound and two centralized crypto lenders, said Jack Jia, Wyre’s vice president of business.      Ball’s Rolling The former Prudential Securities CEO and current CEO of Sanders Morris Harris, George Ball, suggested bitcoin is “a safe haven” asset. In a recent interview with Reuters, Ball, once a self-defined opponent to blockchain, said crypto looks “very attractive” both in the long term and short term. “The government can’t stimulate the markets forever.”    Quick bites  ING Bank, Rolls Royce join alliance to promote blockchain education (CoinDesk)  15 Ways to stay sane while trading crypto (CoinDesk)  Bitcoin was the second-most-popular asset on TradingView after Tesla stock last month (The Block)  How an anti-meme coin joke backfired into a $1.2 million meme coin (Decrypt)  Meet a freelance cypherpunk developer in Africa (CoinDesk)  At stake    DeFi is a small part of the total Ethereum ecosystem, though it’s sending ripples throughout the larger crypt-verse.      According to DeFi Pulse, the total value locked in the leading DeFi applications is around $6.34 billion, a fraction of Ethereum’s $47.8 billion market cap.      On Friday, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported Ethereum’s derivatives markets are booming – largely in response to DeFi. Open interest in futures, or total value of outstanding contracts, rose to a record high of $1.73 billion on Friday, according to data source Skew, surpassing a previous high of $1.45 billion set 10 days earlier.      “The DeFi boom looks to be powering gains in ether,” said John Ng Pangilinan, managing partner at Singapore-based Signum Capital.      DeFi is also helping set records on Bitcoin. On Sunday, more bitcoins were tokenized for use on Ethereum than were created by the Bitcoin protocol.      About 900 bitcoins are mined per day, while 1,043 more bitcoins were tokenized through wrapped bitcoin, CoinDesk’s Zack Voell reported. The amount of tokenized bitcoin has shot up to nearly 31,000 bitcoins, up from 3,000 in mid-May.    Market intel    Hashing Through? Bitcoin traded below $12,000 over the weekend. The cryptocurrency had consolidated below this critical resistance despite reaching a record hashrate of 129.03 tera hashes per second (TH/s), CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports. Some argue an increasing hashrate is a bullish price signal because it causes miners to hold rather than sell bitcoin, thereby raising the price floor. At press time, Bitcoin had crossed the $12,000 level.    Tech pod    Litecoin’s Lift Litecoin is gearing up for a network upgrade that will integrate the privacy protocol Mimblewimble. The upgrade is supposed to help shield the identities of holders of senders and recipients of litecoin tokens while also improving the network’s ability to handle more transactions. A testnet of Mimblewimble, in the works for almost a year, is targeted for the end of September.    Op-ed    CBDC Circles Carmelle Cadet, founder and CEO of EMTECH, thinks central bank digital currency (CBDC) development will depend upon open protocols, private experimentation and APIs to gain traction. “The tradeoffs between control, interoperability and infinite user experience customization are complex. But there is precedent for dealing with this sort of complexity. Banks have partnered with fintechs to address the market’s need for consumer convenience,” she writes.      Hedge Your Bet? Crypto hedge funds are underperforming blue-chip cryptographic assets such as bitcoin and the S&P 500. Yet, Noelle Acheson, CoinDesk’s head of research, sees a sunny outlook for crypto hedge funds. “Investing in a crypto hedge fund instead of directly in the market is going to be a more attractive option for many investors even if the returns are slightly lower, because using a vehicle run by seasoned management is probably safer than direct market participation. Investors don’t have to worry about custody, best execution and liquidity crunches,” she writes in the latest Crypto Long and Short newsletter. Subscribe here to get it in your inbox.

Ether, trading around $430, is looking to extend a run of four straight weeks of gains during which prices have nearly doubled.      In traditional markets, U.S. equity futures and European stocks advanced after China's central bank pumped about $100 billion into the country's banking system.

We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.    Market Moves    Hope Springs Eternal for Underperforming Litecoin as Mimblewimble Nears - By Omkar Godbole      The cryptocurrency litecoin (LTC) is often referred to as the silver to bitcoin’s gold. This year, litecoin investors would have been better off staying in the analog world: While bitcoin (BTC) has gained twice as much as gold, litecoin has only recently caught up with silver.      Some investors now foresee a rally developing in litecoin prices, with a key upgrade looming and signs that activity is increasing on the blockchain network.      The upgrade is to add a “privacy protocol” known as Mimblewimble, which is supposed to help shield the identities of holders of senders and recipients of litecoin tokens while also improving the network’s processing capacity. A testnet of Mimblewimble, in the works for almost a year, is targeted for implementation by the end of September.      And based on market data, it appears the looming addition is generating enthusiasm among users: Daily confirmed transactions on litecoin’s blockchain has more than doubled this year, reaching a 7-day average of 48,948 last week, the highest since February 2018, according to data source Glassnode.      Litecoin backers hope the token’s added privacy features from the Mimblewimble upgrade will help attract users who otherwise might gravitate toward existing privacy coins like monero (XMR) and zcash (ZEC). Those tokens come with their own risks, such as the potential for holders to get diluted by new issuance.      The speculation is the upgrade could help litecoin, which has gained about 50% this year to $63, catch up with bitcoin’s 64% increase.      “Litecoin’s upcoming Mimblewimble upgrade has led to a spike in transactions and active addresses,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index futures.      For a longer version of this article online, click here.    Bitcoin Watch    Although bitcoin appears stuck in a narrowing price range, investor interest in futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), a sign of increased institutional demand, continues to grow.      Open interest on the CME, or the number of outstanding contracts, rose to a fresh record high of $864 million on Friday, topping last week's record of $841 million, according to data source Skew. The CME has recently climbed in the ranks to become the third-largest bitcoin futures exchange by open interest.      Growth in futures trading volume, however, has stalled over the past two weeks, which might actually be bullish: A combination of rising open interest and low volumes usually indicates investors are holding on to their positions. Typically when that happens, the market continues its prior trajectory, which in this case was up.      So bitcoin could break out of the current price-consolidation pattern, represented by an ascending triangle on the daily chart, with a convincing move above $12,000. That breakout, if confirmed, would imply a continuation of the rally from July lows below $9,000 and open the doors for stronger gains. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $11,870 on major exchanges.      – Omkar Godbole, Markets Reporter    Token Watch    Ether (ETH) futures hit new record – Investor interest in ether futures and options hit a new peak on Friday as the cryptocurrency’s price rose to 25-month highs. Open interest in futures or total value of outstanding contracts rose to a record high of $1.73 billion on Friday, according to data source Skew. Prices for the token have more than tripled this year to about $430.      Chainlink (LINK) developers taking profits? – According to the website Trustnodes, Chainlink developers have sold some $40 million of link tokens this month. Trustnodes, citing its own analysis, said about 500,000 of the link tokens are getting sent every week to the cryptocurrency exchange Binance and other venues . The ""oracle"" token has become a darling in cryptocurrency markets in 2020 because of its perceived potential for fast-growing ""decentralized finance"" trading and lending systems. The token is up 10-fold this year, the top performance by far among digital assets with a market value of at least $1 billion.      Curve (CRV) debuts early in another nutty DeFi moment – After the frenzy earlier this week in Compound's COMP tokens and last week's madness in YAM tokens, it's anybody's guess how the newest token from decentralized finance, or DeFi, will perform in its early days. In this case, the nuttiness has already begun: According to CoinDesk's Colin Harper, an anonymous DeFi user late last week deployed Curve Finance's Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and token smart contracts without the team’s permission . Following the deployment, Curve Finance tweeted it had “no choice but to adopt it,” saying in another tweet it appears “to be an acceptable deployment with the correct code.” Here's what trading in the token looks like so far, per CoinGecko:    Tweet of the day  What's Hot    Bitcoins Are Being Tokenized Faster Than They’re Mined as DeFi Craze Continues (CoinDesk) Since Sunday, 1,043 more bitcoins were tokenized through Wrapped Bitcoin than produced by bitcoin miners, as the Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) boom shows no signs of abating.

Data from Glassnode shows the seven-day average for bitcoin’s hashrate – the computing power dedicated to mining blocks – rose to a record high of 129.03 exahashes per second (EH/s) over the weekend.  Bitcoin's July rally has stalled near $12,000, making the psychological level a resistance to beat for the bulls. It was sidelining near $11,900 at press time.  But some argue that an increasing hashrate is a bullish price signal.  Earlier this year, Jeremy Britton, CEO of Boston Trading Co. told Finance Magnates rising hashrate forced miners to hoard rather than sell newly mined coins, reducing downwards pressure and raising the price floor.  But price increases don't always follow from higher hashrates, according to Philip Gradwell, an economist at the blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis.  “Miners may be better at predicting the future price, but that doesn’t really cause the prices to go up,” Gradwell told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat on Monday.  A direct correlation between the hash rate and the price has not been seen before – bitcoin's price fell 30% in the second half of 2019 even though the hashrate rose 64% to 97 EH/s.  Stack Fund co-founder and COO Matthew Dibb told CoinDesk miners may be scaling up their capacity, ergo hashrate, in anticipation of a rising bitcoin price, but didn't think there was actually an established causal link between the two.

42384446,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXQvF,1597661099,"Litecoin Gets Bullish Speculation, at Last, as Upgrade Approaches","The cryptocurrency litecoin is often referred to as the silver to bitcoin’s gold. This year, litecoin investors might have been better off staying in the analog world: While bitcoin has gained twice as much as gold, litecoin has barely kept up with silver.      Some investors now foresee a rally developing in litecoin prices, with a key upgrade looming and signs that activity is increasing on the blockchain network.      The upgrade will put in effect a “privacy protocol” known as Mimblewimble, which is supposed to help shield the identities of holders of senders and recipients of litecoin tokens while also improving the network’s ability to scale to handle more transactions. A testnet of Mimblewimble, in the works for almost a year, is targeted for the end of September.      And based on market data, it appears the looming addition is generating enthusiasm among users: Daily confirmed transactions on litecoin’s blockchain has more than doubled this year, reaching a seven-day average of 48,948 last week, the highest since February 2018, according to data source Glassnode.      Litecoin backers hope the token’s added privacy features from the Mimblewimble upgrade will help attract users who otherwise might gravitate toward existing privacy coins like monero (XMR) and zcash (ZEC). Those tokens come with their own risks, such as the potential for holders to get diluted by new issuance.      The speculation is the upgrade could help litecoin, which has gained about 50% this year to $63, catch up with bitcoin’s 64% increase.      “Litecoin’s upcoming Mimblewimble upgrade has led to a spike in transactions and active addresses,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index futures.      Litecoin’s facility for handling a large number of transactions at any given moment is supposed to increase with the upgrade, helping to solve “scalability” concerns that had deterred some users and investors, according to Nicholas Pelecanos, head of trading at NEM Ventures, a cryptocurrency investment firm.      ""In 2017, a huge bottleneck for development in the blockchain space was scaling,"" Pelecanos said. ""The issue will now be solved with protocol upgrades due across the majority of leading protocols, leaving valuations at lifetime highs.""      The litecoin network’s processing speed has doubled this year to about one transaction every two seconds. But that’s still far slower than the Bitcoin blockchain, which can handle about 3.7 transactions every second. The upcoming protocol upgrade could further boost transaction capacity.      One concern with the added privacy features is that it’s not yet clear how they’ll sit with regulators. Coinbase UK delisted zcash last year, likely due to pressure from financial watchdogs. South Korean exchange Upbit delisted privacy coins monero, dash and zcash in 2019.      “There's some stigma against privacy coins, and some exchanges have delisted them,” Litecoin founder Charlie Lee told CoinDesk in a recent interview. “But from what I can tell, the exchanges are OK with this litecoin privacy upgrade as an extension block because it's kind of on the side. The exchanges don't have to support the extension block side of things.”      David Schwartz, project director at Litecoin Foundation, a non-profit organization that sponsors development on the blockchain, wrote on Twitter earlier this month that he thought the cryptocurrency was undervalued.      “Its average usage has doubled since the start of the last bull run & is gaining steam,” he tweeted. “So much so, that transactions have outpaced historical price, which means price is not showing its true value.""      There’s some skepticism, of course. Crypto markets are notoriously speculative.      “The recent pickup may be attributable to the upcoming upgrade,” says Connor Abendschein, research analyst at Digital Assets Data, but “greater bullish sentiment across the entire crypto market has driven prices of most assets higher over the past few months.”      “As the upgrade draws closer, we will see whether litecoin is just rising bitcoin’s coattails, or if it can find some legs and run on its course,” Abendschein said.      Correction (12:50 UTC, Aug. 17, 2020): An earlier version erroneously quoted Nicholas Pelecanos as saying that LTC's network faced bottlenecks in 2017.

42384441,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXQox,1597658579,APIs Will Decentralize CBDCs,"Carmelle Cadet is the founder and CEO of EMTECH, a fintech for central banks, and a former IBM Global Finance & Business Leader.      According to several surveys, up to 80% of central banks are exploring the prospect of launching a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Furthermore, the Bank International Settlements (BIS) has essentially said “let’s get on with it"" and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is now making the case for a public/private model of CBDC implementation.      The Brooking Institution’s latest paper on design choices for CBDCs shows how far the conversation has come since the start of the year. It’s time to explore what various stakeholders can expect from this transformation. What is their role or benefit in all of this? How might a centralized token help us to do everything we do today with money, and more?      And let’s face it: How are they going to make money in this new world?      See also: Kaj Burchardi & Igor Mikhalev – Central Bank Digital Currencies Need Decentralization      The tradeoffs between control, interoperability and infinite user experience customization are complex. But there is precedent for dealing with this sort of complexity. Banks have partnered with fintechs to address the market's need for consumer convenience, and they are leveraging application programming interfaces (APIs) to do it.      Look at Plaid, which was acquired by Visa recently for $5.3 billion. It provides APIs for banks or insurers to connect to a broad set of user-orientated apps. This connectivity of different worlds and systems facilitates a sound, efficient and resilient financial market while increasing market liquidity.    Many markets desperately need to leapfrog to the digital economy    Such strategic alliances offer an interoperable model for more players in the ecosystem – at the country level in case of CBDC – while providing guardrails via smart contracts, risk-based limits on wallets, data-driven policymaking and market competition.      In leveraging an established banking infrastructure, non-banks can build for last-mile reach, informal and cash-based trade networks, and cross-border payments.      Many markets desperately need to leapfrog to the digital economy and others can’t afford to be left behind. Non-banks such as Payment Service Providers or various Interface Providers such as Venmo, Apple Pay, PayPal and TransferWise have demonstrated interest and successful business models to target these unique markets in innovative ways.      See also: PayPal, Venmo to Roll Out Crypto Buying and Selling: Sources      We’re gradually seeing more regulatory frameworks for a “bank + fintech” collaboration. In the past year, the U.S.' Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has ruled banks can now be crypto custody providers, PayPal has started accepting bitcoin and the Bank of England has floated a potential CBDC Ecosystem.      Just last month, the Bank of Ghana laid out the groundwork for what a payment provider needs to get licensed in a prospective electronic money environment.      These bank/non-bank collaborations are defined in parallel to CBDCs, centrally issued and managed tokens, as well as policy and design conversations. This is a critical time that will ultimately define who plays what role in the CBDC ecosystem.      See also: 4 Myths About CBDCs Debunked      The Brookings paper has started to map out a web of rails, endpoints and participants that will need to be defined and serviced. In other words, there are multiple roles the private sector can play in the access and usage of a CBDC.      CBDCs offer a digital infrastructure to issue and manage a sovereign currency in digital form. Central banks’ limited mandate to set an inflation target or manage for full employment leaves room for the private sector to innovate on a robust and trusted foundation.      Although still relatively new, APIs are already proving their value in connecting many systems together for a variety of use cases. It is therefore not only imperative, but mutually beneficial for central banks to offer “CBDC access APIs” to banks and nonbanks in order to decentralize the CBDC infrastructure for full inclusion, market resilience and better system efficiency.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Carmelle Cadet,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/08/17/apis-will-decentralize-cbdcs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d9d8f7884b3557b488b82bda0e0cd8b87517d9e-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In July the DG Lab conglomerate, which like Ethereum powerhouse ConsenSys includes both an investment arm and an adjacent software company, open-sourced its proposal for self-sovereign derivatives trading on the Bitcoin blockchain, using discreet log contracts (DLC). (The company is currently researching whether DLC can be integrated with the Lightning Network.)

The Silicon Valley startup cLabs recently acquired DeFi firm Summa, which spearheaded the bitcoin-on-Ethereum approach. Now it looks as though DG Lab, founded in 2015, is the leading incumbent exploring DeFi opportunities for Bitcoin.      Read more: These Bitcoin Users Want DAI and DeFi – Here’s How They Plan to Get It      “I’ve been working on a proposal to integrate DLC channels into the Lightning Network,” Crypto Garage researcher Ichiro Kuwahara said of his recent work. “We can establish many contracts without broadcasting transactions on the blockchain.”      DLC could one day tap the Lightning Network to execute business logic without clogging up the base-layer blockchain. The hottest trend among Bitcoin veterans these days is imagining DeFi functionality applied to the bitcoin currency through such layers. There are many opinions on how to approach this opportunity, from DLC to soft forks.    Competition    Not everyone agrees on how to use Lightning for smart contracts.      Bitcoin veteran Jeremy Rubin, who launched his Judica startup this summer, believes Blockstream’s Liquid Network, which companies like Crypto Garage use to experiment with such smart contracts, overcomplicates the construction.      “I think we can do it much simpler. … It’s solvable on-chain but can be done in [Lightning] channels as well,” Rubin said in an interview, explaining how his proposed Bitcoin soft fork could optimize the base layer for smart contracts. “I can construct this contract, which is a derivative, without you being online. I can make a valid contract then email it to you.”      Read more: This New Coding Language Could Help Unlock Bitcoin’s Smart Contract Potential      These days, both ends of a Lightning transaction need to participate at roughly the same time for the payment to go through. (Or, at least, both need to set everything up in advance.) Rubin is arguing there’s a way to make it so one party can execute a consensual transaction. Public keys allow the other party to see, whenever they come online, proof of everything about the deal.      “It’s this notion of flow and conditionality that doesn’t currently exist in Bitcoin,” Rubin said. “[These 2020 DeFi projects] are about helping define commutes … a sequence of steps that can happen based on choices along the way.”      There are enough engineers working on DeFi options for Bitcoin that one of them might technically work, even if socially it doesn’t catch on. Only time will tell which ones find product market fit, and how that may or may not spur crypto adoption.    Japanese bulls    Stepping back, the DeFi bulls at DG Lab Fund raised over $93 million in 2019 and, according to the firm’s blog post, are raising a second fund in 2020.      The fund invested in DG Lab, the separate namesake startup, which simultaneously attracted investors from Japanese enterprises including the e-commerce giant Kakaku.com and the telecommunications provider KDDI. Meanwhile, the DG Lab Fund itself invested in River Financial, Arwen, Blockstream and Curv, to name a few, in addition to startups in adjacent sectors such as AI and security.      Read more: Polychain Capital, Square Crypto’s Steve Lee Invest in Bitcoin Broker’s $5.7M Seed Round      “We have several startups that are working with DLC. For example, Suredbits is one of the key players in this field and we are working closely with them,” said Shunichi Kimuro, senior manager at DG Lab Fund. “We wanted to show what is possible using the Bitcoin protocol by using our peer-to-peer [P2P] derivatives.”      Yet another startup called Crypto Garage, in which DG Fund did not invest directly, is using Blockstream’s Liquid technology to explore this type of smart-contract software.      Read more: Custody Startup Curv Follows Crypto Demand Into Asia With New Hong Kong Office      “You define the outcomes of your contracts and create a transaction for each of the outcomes. And it can only be unlocked with one of the outcome transactions or with mutual agreement between the contract participants,” Crypto Garage engineer Thibaut Le Guilly said in an interview.      Rubin pointed out that even if he disagrees with Le Guilly on certain aspects these Bitcoin projects have much more in common with each other than with Ethereum DeFi projects.    Different goals    “There’s a really big gap between DeFi, as Ethereum is trying to do it, and P2P finance,” Rubin said. “Uniswap is really great. But they tokenize their liquidity pools. … We [Bitcoiners] are talking about finding a way for people to work directly with each other.”      Bitcoin DeFi projects aren’t using representatives of bitcoin, they want to enable traders to do tasks directly with bitcoin.      “There are about 20 people in the Bitcoin community working on tools, applications and specifications for [Discreet Log Contracts], including at SuredBits,” Le Guilly said in an interview. “[Traders] don’t have to involve an exchange.”      It appears as though Ethereum DeFi advocates offer a different interpretation of decentralization than their node-obsessed Bitcoiner brethren. Bitcoin advocates are focused on every user being able to participate in the network by running their own full financial stack, while Ethereum fans are more focused on the ability to offer their services from any data center around the world.      Bison Trails CEO Joe Lallouz said his infrastructure startup can easily move accounts across borders, thanks in part to a distributed team. This, from his perspective, is a slightly decentralized step away from Silicon Valley norms.      Read more: Token Sales Are Back in 2020      “If Amazon said you can’t run nodes, for example, we can very quickly and seamlessly move our infrastructure to other cloud providers,” Lallouz said. “Everyone at the same time would have to say the blockchain network is something we don’t support [to censor our customers] across the internet.”      While Ethereum DeFi experiments attract quick flashes of capital, losing considerable sums as advocates iterate, Bitcoin DeFi experiments seem comparatively modest. Yet, veterans know not to underestimate the Bitcoin development scene in Tokyo, home to the creators of self-sovereignty experiments including BTCPay and DG Lab. This period may just be the calm before a perfect storm.      “Once there are enough people to create a real market, we might offer services or tools we can monetize,” Crypto Garage’s Le Guilly said. “At this stage, our goal is to raise awareness about what can be done with Bitcoin.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TOKEN SALE | FORKS,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/08/17/bitcoin-defi-may-be-unstoppable-what-does-it-look-like,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

Ball, who claimed himself as a Bitcoin and blockchain opponent, said in an interview with Reuters on Aug. 14 that bitcoin or another cryptocurrency is “very attractive” both in the long term and short term and predicted more people will turn to the crypto market after the Labor Day.      “The government can't stimulate the markets forever,” Ball said. “The liquidity flood will end. Sooner or later, the government’s got to start paying for some of these stimulus, for some of the deficits, for some of the well-deserved, very smart subsidies that it's providing to people. Are they going to raise taxes that high? Or, if not, are they going to print money? If they print money, that debases the currency and probably even things like TIPS – Treasury inflation-protected securities – can be corrupted.”      This would likely lead to very wealthy investors and traders to turn to bitcoin “or something like it as a staple,” he concluded, hinting that a growing interest in cryptocurrencies from high-net-worth investors.      Ball is not the first one who has noticed this investment trend in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.      Mike Novogratz, chief executive of the digital-current firm Galaxy Digital, told Bloomberg TV back in April that he has observed new players including hedge funds and high-net-worth individuals have been buying cryptocurrencies amid the financial shakeup caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
