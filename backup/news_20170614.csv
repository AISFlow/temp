42399996,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzPdo,1497474034,"US, Kenya, Singapore: AIG Completes Multinational Blockchain Insurance Test","Insurance giant American International Group (AIG) and UK global bank Standard Chartered have completed a blockchain pilot designed to simplify some of the industry's most complicated insurance policies.  Built by IBM using the open-source Hyperledger Fabric protocol, the pilot revealed today tested a commercial insurance master policy written out of London and applied to local policies in the US, Kenya and Singapore.  By moving the policy from the traditional system where each counterparty would hold its own records to a self-executing smart contract written on the Fabric blockchain, the pilot reportedly showed how real-time visibility into the insurance coverage could allow recipients to be automatically notified following an insurable event.  Rob Schimek, CEO of Commercial at AIG, said in a statement:  ""Our pilot proves blockchain has a powerful role to play in the future of insurance.""  The multinational commercial insurance risk transfer was also notable for granting additional stakeholders (including brokers and auditors) credentials designed to show them only what they needed for their individual roles in the coverage plan.  According to the statement, the pilot recorded and tracked events that could trigger the payment of a policy, while ensuring that no single party was able to change the terms of coverage ""without the consensus from others on the network"".  The pilot jurisdictions were selected because they each represented different traits of a potential market. Specifically, the US market was selected for its size and complexity; Singapore was identified as a possible growth market for Standard Chartered; and Kenya was chosen for its unusual regulatory requirements around dispersals.  While London-based Standard Chartered has long been a leader in the blockchain sector, most recently announcing plans to launch a cross border payments platform powered by blockchain, this is one of AIG’s first public forays into the industry.  Over the past few months, insurance has become a heated space for blockchain innovation, with three new firms joining the blockchain insurance consortium B3i and Shanghai Insurance Exchange and nine other partners completing a test focused on this application.  Ultimately, project participants were optimistic about the test and what it hints at for this blockchain use case going forward.  The general manager of IBM Blockchain, Marie Wieck, said in a statement:  ""There is tremendous opportunity to apply advancements in blockchain technology to transform the insurance industry.""

42400010,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzPne,1497473132,Bitcoin Price Hits 10-Day Low As Crypto Markets Tumble,"The price of bitcoin continues to edge lower.  At press time, bitcoin was down 5.5% across global exchanges, falling to a low of $2,547.18. This figure was down nearly 15% from an all-time high of over $3,000 reached on 11th June, according to CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. This marked the lowest total observed on the BPI since 4th June, when average prices across exchanges fell to $2494.29.  Elsewhere, other cryptocurrencies were in the red. The price of ether, ethereum's native cryptocurrency, declined by nearly 10% to reach a low of $361. This was after testing new highs of more than $400 over this past weekend.  In the meantime, the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization according to data service Coinmarketcap almost all fell for an average 7%. Even IOTA, a token for an Internet of Things-specific distributed ledger software was down 15% after a strong market debut yesterday.  Bucking this trend, however, was Ripple's XRP token, the third-largest by market capitalization after bitcoin and ethereum, which surged for nearly 10% today.  According to data service Coinmarketcap, Korean Won trading contributed to 61.5% of XRP volume with $271m in volume taking place across its three major exchanges.

42399990,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzPYt,1497464134,Australian Politician Calls for Bitcoin Scrutiny in Fight Against Terrorism,"A major Australian politician is calling for the government to increase its oversight on bitcoin.  In a speech Tuesday, first reported by The Register, Australia's opposition leader Bill Shorten suggested that government regulations on bitcoin should be more stringent to mitigate the chance it could be used illicitly by terrorists and cybercriminals.  Shorten, who leads the Australian Labor Party argued that as criminals are already seeking to ""obscure their financial deals"", and that digital currencies could become a prime target for exploitation when paired with the anonymity afforded by the dark web.  Shorten said:  ""We must target this threat head on. As terrorists adapt their methods and seek to hide online, we must ensure our agencies have the tools, resources and technology so terrorism has no place to hide.  The comments are the latest sign out of Australia that the government is beefing up its efforts to regulate and control encryption services.  Earlier this month, both Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and attorney general George Brandis went public with their belief that the pervasive use of encryption is proving problematic for law enforcement.  Further, the developments come amidst a wave of new increased attention for the more negative use cases of bitcoin. Following major ransomware attacks, law enforcement discussion now appears more active and critical of the emerging technology.

42400001,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzPgl,1497460712,Illinois Eases Burden for Cryptocurrency Startups with New Guidance,"The financial regulatory arm of the state of Illinois has clarified its rules for cryptocurrency companies operating in the state.  Announced yesterday  by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR), the completed regulatory guidance clarified that digital currency is not captured under the definition of money used in the state's Transmitters of Money Act (TOMA). The final announcement was published after nearly six months after the agency's initial request for comments.  The guidance also clarified activities that are generally regarded as 'money transmission', including the exchange of digital currency for money through a third-party exchanger or an automated machine. Digital currency businesses whose practices meet these definitions will now need to secure a TOMA license.  Other activities such as miners receiving digital currency for verifying transactions, exchanging only between digital currencies and exchanging digital currency for money between two parties are excluded from this category.  Perhaps most notably, however, the IDFPR went on to state that industry startups can use cryptocurrencies as permissible investments, arguing that capital requirements in traditional currencies imposed ""added burdens"" on smaller operations.  The report reads:  ""The [IDFPR] understands dollar-denominated capital reserve requirements impose added burdens on digital currency companies and therefore will consider digital currency reserves as a form of permissible investment.""  Elsewhere, the IDFPR said it will allow applicants to consider digital currency they own or hold as part of their net worth, though such a recognition does not include any digital currency held on behalf of others.

42400045,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzPpc,1497452784,Survey: Enthusiasm for Ethereum Hit an All-Time High in Q1,"This article highlights findings from CoinDesk Research's new Q1 2017 State of Blockchain report, focusing on data from our 'Bitcoin and Ethereum Sentiment Study'.    Click here to download the slides as a PDF.    There's no sugarcoating it – the price of ether has been on a tear.  Since the start of 2017, the value of the ethereum blockchain's native token has far exceeded its price at any time in the network's short history.  Data from Q1 2017  , however, showcases that this is only part of a larger story. Perhaps the most revealing statistic from our 'Bitcoin and Ethereum Sentiment Study' stemmed from the simplest question one could ask.  When queried about overall sentiment on the 'state of bitcoin' and how it compared to the 'state of ethereum', there was a stark contrast.  Respondents were absolutely ecstatic about ethereum, with less than 5% responding negatively.  In contrast, sentiment around bitcoin was largely split.  Study in contrasts  Some of the negativity toward bitcoin undoubtedly stemmed from the continued rise in daily transaction numbers and average block sizes, which reached their all-time highs in the first quarter amid record-breaking transaction fees and confirmation times.  Perhaps, however, there is a positive side to the increasing network use – the simple fact that all-time high transaction volumes and fees occurred at the same time, illustrating that the demand to use bitcoin did not falter amidst exponentially largely costs.  Another question found that many users now view bitcoin as less of a 'digital currency' (like its creator Satoshi Nakamoto seemingly described in the 'Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System' white paper), and more of a 'digital gold' (seemingly used more for value storage and investment).  Perhaps as a result, there's a growing belief that other cryptocurrencies can also be used for transactional and exchange purposes.  Notably, as questions got more granular, this discrepancy in sentiments continued.  For example, the bitcoin mining network is now also seen as much more centralized than ethereum's, despite the fact that certain ethereum mining pools currently account for larger percentageshttps://etherchain.org/statistics/miners of its network's hashing power when compared to bitcoin.  When it came to supporting projects, sentiment on ethereum also largely remained positive.  Despite the early stage of many ethereum dapps, participants were very positive on the current landscape of projects across the ecosystem.  Further, while seemingly initially created as a system aimed at disrupting traditional incumbents, most appear positive and excited about traditional financial and technology firms becoming involved in ethereum, even if focused on 'permissioned' forms of the network.  Beyond gathering feedback and sentiment around the current 'state of ethereum', our Q1 study also had participants look ahead with their predictions on the future of the network.  The community is positive about ethereum's impending transition to a 'proof of stake' consensus algorithm, and the effect it will bring to the overall decentralization of the network – with 93% confident it will be live by the end of 2018.  Indeed, when it comes to technical progress, expectations for ethereum are now exceeding bitcoin's in certain areas. Respondents, for example, indicated that off-blockchain scaling solutions are more likely to take place on ethereum.  Overall, 57% think we'll see Raiden (ethereum's off-chain scaling technology) live in 2017 and 87% believe Raiden will be live by the end of 2018. By comparison, just 19% said they think bitcoin's long-proposed Lightning Network would be live this year.  Also notable was the fact that more respondents thought that the Lightning Network would not be live until '2020 or later'.  As ethereum continues to grow, however, it remains to be seen whether it can keep its momentum – and optimism – amid an influx of users, projects and startups. Already, signs suggest there could be tensions here as sky-high expectations meet the reality of shaping a large, distributed network.

Dubbed the Blockchain Symposium, the event will be held at the Park Central Hotel on 13th July, the organization announced this week. The lineup includes representatives from regulatory agencies including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  FINRA's event announcement came in tandem with the launch of its new Innovation Outreach Initiative, which, according to a statement, will function as a kind of communication hub for members who are dealing with new financial technologies, including blockchain. According to its website, more than 600,000 brokers in the US are part of FINRA.  Specific elements of the effort include the creation of a Fintech Industry Committee, as well as the kick-off of regional roundtables for FINRA members to collaboratively discuss technological shifts.  ""The Innovation Outreach Initiative will enable us to better track fintech developments across the rapidly changing industry environment in order to support innovation in the industry while maintaining investor protection and market integrity,"" Robert Cook, FINRA's president and CEO, said in a statement.  FINRA has previously highlighted how its mandate – and the rules by which its members adhere – could face change in the near future. Back in January, FINRA said in a report that many of its rules, as well as those advanced by regulators such as the SEC, ""are potentially implicated by various DLT applications"".

42399997,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzPen,1497441611,Hyperledger Takes on Blockchain Scaling with New Working Group,"How should a blockchain's performance be measured?  As businesses begin asking this question in earnest, the open-source, Linux-led Hyperledger project has announced a new Performance and Scalability Working Group (PSWG) aimed at measuring how the various available blockchains will perform as their popularity and usage increases.  Leading the effort is Mark Wagner, a senior principal software engineer at Red Hat who has 15 years experience in performance and scalability. Red Hat was one of the founding members of Hyperledger, and at the end of 2016, Wagner became the software company’s representative on the project.  Wagner explained one of the expected results of the group's work will be to maintain a matrix of the key performance metrics and corresponding data for different blockchain implementations. The data is planned to help end users better choose the right platform to fit their needs.  As Wagner envisions it, the group will eventually develop a suite of downloadable kits anyone can use to test distributed ledger platforms, such as Hyperledger, Corda and Quorum, as well as public blockchains, like bitcoin and ethereum.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We would like to design something that would work across the industry, not just for Hyperledger.""  PSWG, which has 20 members so far, held its first meeting on 22nd May. Moving forward, the group plans to meet twice a month. PSWG is one of severalhttps://wiki.hyperledger.org/start Hyperledger working groups, all of which anyone can join.  Setting the scope  While often thought of as one and the same, performance and scalability aren't synonymous – performance refers to how long it takes a system to process a request, while scalability relates to a system's ability to handle an increase in workload, such as when new users are added to a system.  Why is this important? Because evidence is compelling that scaling cannot be an afterthought – it needs to be a part of the system architecture right from the start.  Bitcoin, for example, has become a poster child for the types of problems that can emerge when a network is not built to scale. Following massive growth, transaction processing times are taking longer and costing more, and the community is divided on how to address the issue (if they believe it's an issue at all).  While it's working with multiple distributed ledger platforms, Hyperledger nonetheless faces similar problems in its attempt to empower a diversity of stakeholders.  To measure performance and scalability in a meaningful way, everyone must be working within a common framework, otherwise, it becomes difficult to compare notes.  Wagner concluded:  ""This is new, exciting, and in some cases, uncharted territory.""

42400002,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzPij,1497434414,Bitcoin Scaling: How to Give Everyone More Control,"Jimmy Song is a bitcoin developer and principal architect at blockchain technology startup Paxos.  In this opinion piece, Song discusses bitcoin's scaling debate, arguing that the long-proposed idea of adding sidechains to the digital currency's protocol could ultimately provide the best path forward.      Politics has gripped bitcoin – it's about the only thing people have been wanting to talk about for the past few years.  I've written before about how the bitcoin ecosystem is like the three branches of government, with developers being the legislative branch, miners serving as the executive branch and users being the judicial branch. I've also written about how bitcoin changes through consensus, and how consensus is not supposed to be easy.  In this article, I examine an alternative path to the current political stalemate and how that can help empower developers, miners and users.  Current state of miners  Among mining manufacturers, it's pretty obvious that Bitmain is the biggest and most successful. They produce somewhere around 50–75% of the bitcoin network hash power through their chips and other manufacturers have a tough time competing with them on price.  Their first product, the S1, came out in 2014 when there were many more competitors (CoinTerra, KnCMiner and Spondoolies-Tech to name a few). They distinguished themselves by having the product on hand at various bitcoin conferences and, unlike many of their competitors, having great supply chain management helped them win fans around the world.  As bitcoin experienced a three-year bear market, many mining manufacturers simply went out of business as the economics turned from wildly profitable to barely survivable. It didn't help that many had products that often had defects and delivery issues. Bitmain not only survived this time, but thrived, and managed to capture significant market share.  Whatever your opinion of the company may be, Bitmain is the most dominant miner and they are the 800-pound gorilla in the mining space.  Current state of developers  It's well known that Satoshi Nakamoto made the first bitcoin client and released it to the world in 2009. Many people have contributed to what's called the 'reference client' and Bitcoin Core, as it’s now called, has hundreds of developers that contribute to the open-source repository.  What's less known is that there have been many different attempts to create alternative bitcoin clients. Obelisk, btc-d, Toshi and bcoin are just some of the many attempts at creating new clients from scratch.  Bitcoin Unlimited  , Bitcoin XT and the newest Segwit2x are some forks of Bitcoin Core. While each has had a varying degree of success, it appears most of the network continues to run Bitcoin Core (most estimates are well over 90%).  Why is Bitcoin Core the most popular? There's certainly history to consider. People managing money tend to be conservative and changing any part of the tool chain for managing money tends to be a dicey proposition as any errors may cause monetary loss. Further, Core has the largest developer community and the most rigorous development processes in place.  Whatever your opinion of Bitcoin Core may be, the team continues to produce the dominant client on the network, and they are the 800-pound gorilla in the development space.  Balance of power  While before 2014 the miners and developers generally got along, things started to change once the issue of scaling came up. We've now got to the point where the scaling conflict is often seen as Bitmain vs Bitcoin Core (I'm sure neither are happy with that characterization). Either way, we have two dominant groups that have been in conflict.  Miners are frustrated because they've been asking for large blocks for years. From Bitmain's perspective, none of the developers seem even interested in any sort of hard fork. When they ask, the usual responses range from ""Follow the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal process"" (which inevitably gets voted down) to ""Fork off"".  Developers are frustrated because they've been asking for SegWit for years. From Bitcoin Core's perspective, the miners seem to be obstructing good technology for no good reason. When they ask for a reason, the usual responses range from ""We want larger blocks"" to ""You're carrying water for Blockstream"".  Consensus and control  Generally, when there's a conflict that's not getting resolved, you have to go up a level of abstraction to figure out the problem.  While scaling is the reason everyone claims for this conflict, the actual reason may lie higher up. And when you think about the actual consensus process that's required to change bitcoin, it's clear that both sides want more control than they currently have.  And this makes sense. Both groups are interested in more say over the long haul as bitcoin becomes more and more valuable. A small concession or precedent set now has consequences going forward.  Bitcoin Core may be thinking a hard fork now would set a precedent for additional, possibly more dangerous, hard forks later. Bitmain may be thinking cooperation on a soft fork without getting some concession would set a precedent for being dominated and having requests ignored later.  Bitcoin Unlimited in this context can be seen as a way to get around the developers by replacing them entirely. Similarly, BIP 148 and other UASF proposals are a way to get around the miners.  This has brought us to the current impasse. Both sides want control, but given that bitcoin is a consensus-based system, there's no way to give each side what it wants and keep bitcoin on a single chain.  The way to solve this problem, then, is not by trying to solve the presenting technical issue, but by solving the deeper issue of control. The question isn’t so much ""How can we scale bitcoin?"" but ""How can we give each side more control?"".  The naive solution  The most obvious way to give each side more control would be to split bitcoin in two, or what I would call the 'Solomon solution'. We can hard fork bitcoin and each side can do whatever it wants on their chain.  One side would have to find new miners (or even a new proof-of-work function) and the other side would have to find new developers.  While this has some appeal, splitting bitcoin in two has the potential to cause significant collateral damage. Indeed, most contentious forks have this as a possible endpoint as both sides have the ability to hard fork.  Bitcoin may be the baby that dies if nobody agrees.  A more thoughtful solution  So far, we've only been talking about two of the three branches of the bitcoin governance: miners and developers. When the two disagree, the ideal solution would be to have the users adjudicate. Unfortunately, safe, liquid adjudication is only available after a hard fork when the price between the tokens can float.  But what if we can give both miners and developers control over separate, smaller domains? What if each could run separate chains and each could change and use them according to their needs and desires? Further, what if these separate chains were actually extensions of bitcoin itself?  Wouldn't users naturally utilize the one that they preferred? Wouldn't the best idea win instead of the best political player?  If this sounds familiar, it should. This is what the whole sidechains project is all about.  What are sidechains?  If you haven’t heard about sidechains, think of them as a separate blockchain where you can deposit and withdraw bitcoins. That is, if you deposit 1 BTC to the sidechain, you add 1 BTC to your balance on the sidechain. The same goes for withdrawals – it's all done on the sidechain.  The separate blockchain can have all sorts of new features and won't actually affect bitcoin. And this is the key. You can give control of one sidechain to the miners and another to the developers. In fact, you can add lots more sidechains for a variety of purposes to see how well they work.  Users can vote with their feet by going to sidechains that they find most useful. Merchants, for example, may want to go to a sidechain that's much quicker to confirm. Exchanges may want to go to a sidechain with more financial instruments available.  That sounds awesome! Why don’t we have it yet?  Good question. One sidechain implementation already works. The sidechain is called Liquid and has been developed by Blockstream. The startup utilizes something called a 'federation', which is a fancy way of saying deposits to the sidechain are bitcoins sent to multisig addresses.  The Liquid security model requires a bunch (11+) of known, trusted entities (like exchanges) and that's still in the process of being set up. The good news with Liquid is that it requires no changes to the bitcoin protocol in order to work. The bad news is that you have to trust that a majority of entities won't steal from you.  The other sidechain implementation is something called Drivechains. The good news is that Drivechains don't require (less) trusted entities and the code is almost done. The bad news is that Drivechains require a soft fork.  Wouldn't this give everybody what they want? It certainly seems so. Having the market decide instead of committees seems like a much more scalable solution (pun intended). And indeed Paul Sztorc [economist at Bloq] has proposed Drivechains as an alternative to SegWit or 2MB blocks. Segwit can easily be deployed on one sidechain and larger blocks on another.  It's not all good news, however.  There's the obvious fact that BIP 148 and BUIP 0055 are scheduled for 1st August and 18th October, respectively. Both are potentially contentious forks and may very well cause some serious disruption.  Liquid requires finding enough trusted entities in enough jurisdictions. Many users don't like having to trust other entities, so this may be a non-starter.  Drivechains requires a soft fork where miners validate new rules. Further, there are some technical issues that may need to be addressed, as well as code that needs extensive review and testing before a soft fork can happen. Developers and miners would ultimately have to agree to pursue this path.  Conclusion  The benefits of a sidechain solution are pretty clear. Developers and miners are empowered because they can try out new, riskier features on sidechains and don't have to get anyone's approval for doing so.  Each can control their own sidechain without disrupting any other part of bitcoin. Users are empowered since they can have a choice of features without having to leave bitcoin.  The downsides of a sidechain solution are a bit murkier and require a more thorough examination of the incentives to really evaluate properly.  As bitcoin enters its fourth year of scaling conflict, creative solutions like Drivechains and Liquid deserve more rigorous consideration. There very well may be technical or trust issues that are insurmountable, but it's vital that, as a community, we leave no stone unturned.  We are currently embroiled in a bitter political war. This is because we're essentially stuck in a zero-sum game of consensus building. Innovation is a better way to resolve conflict than politics. Politics is messy, divisive and harmful. Innovation is clean, unifying and constructive. If an innovative path can be found, we owe it to ourselves as a community to find it.

42400007,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzPkh,1497430859,Litecoin Foundation Reports 'No Issues' Since SegWit Activation,"The litecoin cryptocurrency adopted an upgrade called Segregated Witness just over a month ago and, so far, the integration is reported to be issue-free.  The code optimization, known popularly as SegWit, was initially put forward as a way to improve the functionality of bitcoin (paving the way for initiatives such as the Lightning Network), while also making more room for data in each transaction block.  As CoinDesk previously reported, litecoin proponents began pushing for a SegWit upgrade earlier this year, a move that culminated with an activation on 10th May following back-and-forth discussions between miners and community stakeholders.  Since then, litecoin community members say, there haven't been any problems to report.  The Litecoin Foundation's Xinxi Wang told CoinDesk in an email:  ""SegWit is a huge success for Litecoin. There is no issue at all. Various Lightning Network teams are working together with the litecoin team.""  Since the integration, some industry startups have moved to embrace the move more fully. On 7th June, hardware wallet provider Trezor announced that its beta series of products would support SegWit for litecoin.  Further adding to interest around the project, litecoin creator Charlie Lee notably announced on 9th June that he was departing Coinbase, where has served as director of engineering after joining the firm in 2013.

42400006,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzPlg,1497427473,Thomson Reuters to Power Blockchain Contracts with Experimental Service,"Media giant Thomson Reuters is opening up its data to smart contract authors building on private versions of the ethereum blockchain and R3's Corda distributed ledger platform.  Released in beta today, a 'smart oracle' called BlockOne IQ (B1IQ) is designed to power smart contracts with the kind of reliable financial information required to let counterparties transact without a middleman. B1IQ allows blockchain participants to leverage the media giant's reputation for providing accurate data about share prices, exchange rates, financial benchmarks and more.  The firm devised what initial data should be offered to blockchain developers based on requests from existing customers. The data being made available is useful for actions including the payment of dividends, stock splits ""and anything where the company’s equity is impacted by some sort of action,"" according to Sam Chadwick, director of Thomson Reuters financial and risk management division.  Currently, the oracle is only experimental.  While Thomson Reuters is targeting the larger members of R3 and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, the oracle can only be used as part of any organization's proofs-of-concept, just not in live applications. By the end the year, Thomson Reuters intends to decide whether to monetize the oracle, or scrap the project altogether, according to Chadwick.  More sophisticated contracts  Centralized applications, such as those run by banks and brokers, have had access to the the firm's data via more traditional APIs and FTPs for some time. But, this launch opens up access to the growing decentralized application market for the data needed to facilitate more sophisticated transactions.  With additional data sets forthcoming, Chadwick believes the oracle could eventually enable an endless array of advanced blockchain transactions without the need of middlemen.  As an example of how a smart contract could facilitate more sophisticated deals, Chadwick described an interest rate swap where one party would pay a floating rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor).  While the role of Libor in such a smart contract would stay the same each time the contract was executed, the number itself changes daily based on industry data. And Thomson Reuters keeps up with those changes. So, a rate swap powered by such a smart contract would query the B1IQ oracle and based on the result, determine which party owes how much.  Chadwick said:  ""The bank, at the moment, plays that middle role. And what we've been looking at is ways in which smart contracts can play the roles [instead].""  Blockchain revenue streams  The oracle product seems to be focused on proactively finding new sources of revenue for Thomson Reuters.  Last year, the firm's Financial & Risk department generated about $6bn in revenue, according to its annual report. While the year-over-year revenue change is negligible (approximately a 1% decrease), the way that revenue was generated has changed dramatically, according to Chadwick.  Though Chadwick said it's too early to comment on whether blockchain efforts could be a potential new source of revenue, he added:  ""Our beta program is intended to understand market demand to inform exactly that point.""  Thomson Reuters plans on opening up access to data to additional blockchain consortia, including the Linux-led Hyperledger project. (The company is part of Hyperledger, R3 and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.)  From there, its plan is to expand its focus from the larger consortia members to the smaller blockchain startups involved in the consortia, Chadwick said. To target startups, Chadwick expects new data sets to be added, specifically around cryptocurrency prices for bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin.  ""Although we've got a bias towards the large banks experimenting, some of the smaller firms just in the crypto-space are very interesting to us as well,"" Chadwick said.  He continued:  ""As crypto-securities show the potential to become new assets, it's a way of experimenting in that space and learning about who's active in that space. too.""  Thomson Reuters is not alone in its aim to provide reliable data to the executors of smart contracts.  Startups like Augur and Gnosis use prediction markets to generate reliable data. Further, firms like Oraclize are building hardware-based solutions for accessing reliable data. And last month Cornell University released its own oracle called 'Town Crier', which uses software guard extensions to help ensure the reliability of the data.

42400009,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzPod,1497410106,PwC Principal: Cryptocurrencies Could Power New Economy,"Talking boldly, and publicly, about a possible future enabled by bitcoin, ether and cryptocurrencies is suddenly very much in vogue.  After years of being taboo, the word is apparently one that senior executives and global financial institutions are no longer afraid to say – at least, that's if the conversation at a conference held today by New York-based news source American Banker was any indication.  To help kick off the publication's fourth annual 'Blockchains + Digital Currencies' event, a principal at PwC went so far as to give a detailed overview of the professional service's take on the future of blockchain, in the process adding to recent bullish statements from senior executives about public blockchain applications.  Addressing a group of about 300 bankers and technologists, Grainne McNamara said:  ""A new decentralized system made possible with cryptocurrencies could be much simpler by removing layers of intermediation. It could help ensure less risks, and by moving in different ways, it will open up the possibility of new and different financial products.""  Contrary to the current financial system that McNamara described as ""very complex"", she argued that an economy powered by cryptocurrencies would lower the barrier to entry for those who are currently excluded, and as a result, increase global competition for these customers.  Past precedent  In the case of PwC, however, that grand vision is more than just talk.  Indeed, divisions of the company have already been among the more active in embracing the possibilities of public blockchains, if not always as openly in the media.  Last year, for example, McNamara addressed a room of regulators in Washington, DC, about the potential merits of cryptocurrencies when her firm revealed revealed Project Vulcan, an effort to make it easier to leverage more open versions of the emerging technology.  In this way, McNamara used her spot onstage to argue that such blockchain applications could positively impact industries beyond finance, including entertainment — which could potentially lead to widespread payment of artists in cryptocurrencies the moment their art is downloaded.  In her conclusion, the PwC principal also revealed her firm's forecast for blockchain industry growth over the next few years.  This included issuing predications that traditional financial firms will take ideas to pilot in 2017 and 2018, while regulators prepare the foundation for their own industry controls.  Still, she painted developments in the world of cryptocurrencies as a complement to this future.  ""I do believe that the continued development of cryptocurrencies will be a good thing for the economy,"" said McNamara.  Smart contracts for the people  Elsewhere, panels examined what it actually means for a blockchain solutions to be ""production ready"", and how smart contracts may someday impact the lives of actual consumers instead of just back-office employees.  During a concluding question-and-answer session with members of the audience, McNamara acknowledged that the impact of smart contracts on global finance was particularly personal, as they could have a potential impact on the role of auditors, including PwC.  As such, she said PwC is now looking more closely at using technology to analyze the impact of a shared, trusted record of transactions on its business.  McNamara concluded:  ""I expect that that would drive down the cost of transactions for participants, because arguably, for the things that are standard and were uniformly enforceable, we should have a more distributed and arguably more accessible framework.""
