The inaugural event was held at the Japan Center eatery, Ramen Underground, last Thursday night. The restaurant has been accepting bitcoin for some time, making it an appropriate venue to host what organizers believe will be the first Bitcoin Fair of many.  In keeping with the spirit of the event, Ramen Underground was offering food and drink specials payable with bitcoin via the use of QR codes on its tables.  ‘First of many’  Bitcoin Fair's co-organizer Nathan Lands said that this particular event is just the start of something bigger. He added:  “This is just a stepping stone. We’ve got to build momentum behind it, just one step at a time.”  Lands worked with event partner Marshall Hayner to organize the fair. They believe that ongoing Bitcoin Fair events could snowball and attract somewhere between 800 to 1,000 people if they were held quarterly, or perhaps even monthly, somewhere in San Francisco.  And they might be right – Ramen Underground had a full house.  Specials and speeches  Not long after the Fair’s 6.30 pm start, the restaurant was standing room only. Lands later confirmed at least 250 people came to socialize and learn about bitcoin. “Luckily people came and went, so it wasn’t all at one time,” he noted.  The gathering was sponsored by law firm Perkins Coie and Quickcoin – a startup that helps merchants with bitcoin transactional data.  Some of the Ramen Underground bitcoin specials for the event included $5 draft beers or glasses of wine, $9 chicken karage, $4 chicken wings and fried potato wedges for $4. All specials were available for payment in bitcoin via QR code placards placed on each table.  After a quick welcoming talk by Marshall Hayner, Perkins Coie partner Jason A Yurasek made a brief speech to the crowd. The Palo Alto-based law firm currently represents a number of bitcoin startups.  He urged startups to use the firms’ startupPerColator product, which helps nascent companies quickly get up and running with the right legal paperwork.  Bitcoin gateway  The event – which lasted three hours – saw startup CEOs, venture capitalists and complete bitcoin newbies having a rare chance to chat about cryptocurrencies. Lands told CoinDesk that the plan is to make the fair an entry point for people who want to enter the world of bitcoin:  “There’s tons of people who have heard of bitcoin, but they don’t know much about it.”  The idea for the Bitcoin Fair is to offer something less in-depth than bitcoin conferences, which can quickly become very immersive and technical affairs.  “Those kinds of events are really valuable, but I’m interested in making something more mainstream and fun,” Lands explained.  The fair, as a result, was created with the idea that actually using bitcoin should be the most important element of the event. “There’s no one out there making it really simple for people to use [bitcoin],” he added.  New partners wanted  Lands and Hayner believe that the fair's concept could prove popular. The fact that the very first event brought in more than 200 people gives traction to that idea.  Other metropolitan areas are already interested in holding their own introductory bitcoin events, Lands said. He added that he is looking for “partners around the world who can try this in their city”.  He pointed specifically to Los Angeles, Vancouver and Orlando, as locations where coin enthusiasts have already expressed interest in staging their own bitcoin fairs in the future.  Lands and Marshall haven’t yet decided where and when the next San Francisco Bitcoin Fair will be held. Their experience at the relatively tiny Ramen Underground, though, indicates that they are going to need to find a venue with a lot more space if they meet their target of 800 next time round.

42425427,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHx7vh,1391947800,Local London Currency Brixton Pound Thrives in Bitcoin’s Shadow,"Somewhere in South London, an organic grocery store is accepting payment for goods in a currency that is not controlled by the Bank of England, and that is transmitted by text from a cellphone.  What may be surprising is that it’s not another trendy store cashing in on the bitcoin bump. Instead, it’s a Brixton shopkeeper taking a local currency that has been in existence since around the same time Satoshi Nakamoto released his fateful paper.  The store is Brixton Wholefoods and its owner is Tony Benest, a 30-year resident of the South London neighbourhood. Benest recently signed up so that his shop could accept the local currency, the Brixton Pound, by SMS. He said:  “It’s an additional form of payment for people who don’t have a credit or debit card, or don’t want to get involved with the banks.”  The Brixton Pound is one of the United Kingdom’s best-known local currencies. It’s been available as paper notes since 2009 and is emblazoned with the faces of famous residents, like David Bowie. But how has the rise of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies affected the South London denomination’s fortunes?  According to Brett Scott, a Brixton resident and author of The Heretic’s Guide to Global Finance, the Brixton Pound has become popular in the past year, but not because bitcoin has paved the way. While the Brixton Pound and bitcoin are both alternative currencies that don’t rely on the Bank of England, they attract users for different reasons.  “In reality, bitcoin tends to appeal to a very different crowd. Local currencies are all about building community ties, whereas bitcoin [...] is focused on preserving personal autonomy and personal wealth,” he said.  Leander Bindewald, a researcher on complementary currencies at the New Economics Foundation, also noted that because bitcoin and local currencies appeal to such different constituencies, the cryptocurrency hasn't translated into gains for local units of exchange.  ""Bitcoin's big user community has never merged with a local community. [Local currencies] are intrinsically different from bitcoin,"" he said.  Bitcoin leads the way  For all the differences between something like bitcoin and the Brixton Pound, though, digital currencies may still be aiding the adoption of local currencies in an indirect way.  [post-quote]  Bindewald believes bitcoin’s prominence has helped push questions about regulation to the forefront for policy makers. The spotlight may be on bitcoin, but some of it is reflecting onto local currencies too.  “Policy makers are realising that bitcoin is asking questions they can’t answer. In this case, it's great because bitcoin is challenging the paradigm,” he said.  Tom Shakhli, who is the engagement manager for the Brixton Pound, agrees that bitcoin’s rise is aiding accepting of alternative currencies as a whole.  While Shakhli highlights the differences in user-base between digital cryptocurrencies and something like the Brixton Pound, a local currency, he admits that for the general public, both units of transaction are often lumped together. While bitcoin is rising in prominence, the Brixton Pound also gets more attention.  “We all fall under the same umbrella, which is alternatives to national currencies. We are all part of that family, I guess. Each one gives the other more credibility,” he said.  Shakhli takes it a step further. He predicts that digital currencies and local currencies will rise in popularity in tandem:  “I imagine in five years’ time, there’ll be some really popular digital currencies, and maybe 50 more local currencies in the UK. I think that’s a safe prediction.”  But it’s not all plain sailing for alternative currencies. As Bindewald points out, there are dangers for local currencies if they become too closely associated with bitcoin. Regulators may be tempted to treat all alternative currencies the same way, to the detriment of local currencies, although Bindewald notes that this is a plausible, although unlikely, scenario.  “There might be negative effects, if the regulation of bitcoin goes in such a way that all alternative currencies are thrown into the same bucket and then dismissed by the regulator,” he said.  Alternative scene  The Brixton Pound isn’t the UK’s first local currency. That honour belongs to the town of Totnes in south Devon, with a population of about 7,000 residents.  The largest local currency economy in the UK is Bristol, where its pound is also heavily supported by the local authority. Bristol residents can pay their council tax in Bristol Pounds and the city's mayor has his salary paid in the local currency.  According to the New Economic Foundation’s Lindewald, local currencies and other alternatives are picking up momentum, not just in the UK but worldwide. One project he is working on is called TradeQoin, a network of small businesses in Europe that issue lines of credit to one another. Bindewald explained:  “There is no central authority issuing credit. This gives businesses more liquidity, cheaper credit and makes them less likely to fail.”  But for all the talk of global transformation through alternative currencies, it’s merchants like Tony Benest at Brixton Wholefoods who will ultimately deal with cryptocurrencies or local currencies as part of their daily trade.  In addition to taking electronic Brixton Pounds, Benest also watches the Keiser Report for bitcoin news. Still, he doesn't consider himself an alternative currency enthusiast. Far from it, he has deep-seated reservations about them.  “Bitcoin probably isn’t quite as convenient for a bit of local shopping. I’ve never even seen one outside of a television set [...] The Brixton Pound is a local gimmick. I don't think it makes much difference,” he said.  He pointed to Brixton Village, a trendy complex of restaurants and cafes in the area, as symptomatic of the problems with the local currency:  “The people in Brixton Village are very keen on the Brixton Pound. It’s a bit like a comment I read in an article about Brixton Village: ‘Saving the economy by people selling coffee to each other’.”  A look at the Brixton Pound  The Brixton Pound (B£) was launched in September 2009 and is administered by the Brixton Pound Community Interest Company.  When it was launched, it took the form of paper notes that were printed with the images of prominent locals, including the aforementioned rock star.  To deter forgers, the notes are watermarked, contain a hologram, and are embossed and numbered. They are sold at about seven local cafes, shops and other businesses around Brixton.  The idea behind the Brixton Pound is to boost the local economy by using currency that ‘sticks to Brixton’. It is meant to be a ‘complementary currency’ that is used alongside pounds sterling. The currency is valued at parity with sterling, except in some cases, where offers are made to users or merchants. The focus is on supporting smaller shops and traders who face competition from high street chains.  Users of the Brixton Pound are given access to special offers on locally sold products, while merchants are given publicity by the organisation that promotes the currency.  The organisation quotes research from the New Economics Foundation that found money spent with independent businesses circulates within the local economy three times longer than when it’s spent at a chain store.  Since September 2011, the Brixton Pound has also been available in an electronic form. Users can transmit the currency by sending an SMS text from a mobile phone to a merchant’s mobile phone. According to Shakhli, 170 businesses have signed up for the electronic Brixton Pound, while more than 250 businesses accept the paper version.  Merchants pay a 1.5% fee on electronic transactions, although Shakhli says that is cheaper than other payment providers like Mastercard or Visa. He adds that there are no additional subscription fees to accept electronic payments, nor are there costs involved in setting up point-of-sale machinery, such as card readers.  Lambeth Council, the local authority, has supported the Brixton Pound in a big way. The council allows local people to use the local currency to pay their business rates.  It also gives council staff the option to have their wages paid in Brixton Pounds. The authority is working on a borough-wide currency, called the Lambeth Pound, slated for release this year.  “The council has been very supportive from the beginning. There is a correlation between a successful Brixton Pound and a successful Brixton in general, so they think it’s been good for the area and want to support it,” Shakhli said.

42425431,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHx7zh,1391941937,"The CoinDesk Mining Roundup: Alydian, Dogecoin and Cloud Mining","Cryptocurrency mining for fun and profit is always better with the latest and greatest information. With that in mind, CoinDesk's regular round-up details some of the most interesting events going on in the mining world in recent days – including an intriguing dogecoin announcement.  So, let’s explore some of the happenings since the last round-up.  Mining heads to the cloud  As bitcoin mining difficulty continues to rise, big-time miners are looking for a leg-up on the competition. If that’s you, you might want to check out this article by Data Center Knowledge (DCK), an online industry news site.  According to the article, those who can’t afford to (or just don’t want to) invest in major mining infrastructure and its issues now have another option – cloud-based mining. This is a business strategy whereby customers can pay a monthly fee to outsource their mining and reap the benefits that way.  The mere fact that DCK is covering mining at all is a sign that bitcoin infrastructure is now a serious business for IT professionals.  CoinTerra miner misses the 2TH/s mark ... for now  Texas-based CoinTerra has begun shipping its new line of bitcoin miners. The company’s much-anticipated $5,999 TerraMiner IV tests out between 1.63 TH/sec and 1.72 TH/sec, which is below the anticipated 2 TH/sec performance.  Because of this disappointment, the plan for its next production run, dubbed ‘batch 3’, is for a redesign aimed to break that 2 TH/sec barrier.  “We are getting closer and closer to the spec with improvements that we are doing on the board,” Ravi Iyengar, CEO of CoinTerra, recently told The Register.  Bankruptcy judge blocks Alydian from assets sale  The Alydian story seems to only worsen as time marches on. The CoinLab-incubated company filed for bankruptcy late last year, revealing that it had piled up debts of $3.6m. Now, a judge is calling into question the propriety of the company itself.  Seattle’s US Bankruptcy Court Judge Karen Overstreet has blocked Alydian from auctioning off its assets, since it has not been able to prove that it actually owns any of its bitcoin mining technology. “What I see is a debtor that has absolutely zero existence,” Overstreet said.  Corporate mines will profit from transaction fees  In the second part of Data Center Knowledge’s bitcoin mining series, it outlines the potential corporatization of bitcoin mines.  Data centres usually have long-term lease agreements, so system administrators will be confronted with planning their future mining hardware in an uncertain world where the difficulty level of the currency quickly increases and profitability exponentially decreases. That could see a shift towards transaction fees as a way to stay profitable.  Large-scale mining projects owned by large corporations will be built in the data center in order to reap financial rewards from payments. Eventually, if bitcoin becomes more of a transactional asset rather than a speculative investment, even the major payment players, for example, could also end up owning bitcoin mining set-ups.  Dogecoin to allow inflation  The surprising rise of dogecoin has been hampered by a few concerns, one of which has been the number of coins that can be mined. The scrypt-based coin was initially pegged at 100 billion units, yet there have been indications that that number is not set in stone.  In an announcement that could create an interesting mining experiment, doge’s creator Jackson Palmer has decided that the altcoin will allow for inflation, creating 10,000 new coins per block after the initial 100 billion are mined, or 5 billion per year.  So, what will that mean for the incentives to mine dogecoin? There will be more coins to mine, for sure, but it's a bit early to say if it’s a positive step overall.  KnCMiner claims ‘massive progress’ on 20nm chip  Swedish miner manufacturer KnCMiner has been making headway on its 20nm chips, it says. The company is striving to be the first to market with that particular node, and the company has announced they have made “massive progress”.  KnCMiner indicates on its website that the second generation Neptune – with that 20nm chip – will ship in the second quarter of 2014. The unit will have 3 TH/sec of mining oomph and is priced at $9,995. There will be a limited batch of 1,200 miners in total.  KnCMiner is also boasting that the units will be more efficient, with a 30% reduction in watts per GH over the previous model.  Centerus joins the cloud mining crowd  Centerus  CEO Carlos Tapang was a speaker at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami recently. He talked about the aggressive marketplace that exists in bitcoin mining today, saying “the competition is really tough in bitcoin mining right now”.  Tapang believes he has a solution to that problem for those interested in profiting from mining bitcoin. His company's “condo mining” concept allows its customers to choose a pool and mine with the company’s equipment – with payouts submitted “by the minute”, according to its website.  Butterfly Labs selling gear on TigerDirect  Maker of ASICs miners Butterfly Labs is now selling its products on Tiger Direct. BFL is going the retail route to better get its mining devices into the hands of potential customers.  The company has had some problems with its clientele and a disgruntled customer is now suing the company. One of the accusations alleges that the company holds onto equipment for itself in order to profit from mining.  BFL has responded that the claim is ""irresponsible and false"".  The value of mining  Early bitcoin investor and advocate Roger Ver recently told a conference of cryptocurrency fans that bitcoin mining is a “billion-dollar market”.  Even with bitcoin’s current market cap at over $11bn, that’s still a significant industry component of the cryptocurrency.  After all, bitcoin mining is a very important function of the protocol itself. The fact that it continues to create new coins and provides essential confirmation of transactions means that the industry surrounding it will only continue to grow. As bitcoin goes, so does mining.  It is, ultimately, an integral part of this revolutionary system.
