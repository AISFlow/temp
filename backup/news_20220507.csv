That&apos;s how long it took ADA investors to recover from the steady downward trend of September 2021. However, the rebound of the ADA price in March did not inspire investors to buy cryptocurrency. Yes, there is a rebound in March… The total fall of the ADA price by more than 70% did not affect investor interest. Trading volumes have remained unchanged since October 2021, whether in the simple range or the global liquidity range. Therefore, special signs for the beginning of the growth trend on the weekly timeframe of the ADA cryptocurrency are still imperceptible. The only clue for buyers is the $0.71 range. Approximately from this range, the price rebound began in March and now the price is slowing down near this range in the weekly timeframe. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/AHwKyHe4/ Thus, if sellers fail to break and fix below the range of $0.71, we will expect the beginning of consolidation in the range of $0.71-$1.24. It is this consolidation that can lay the foundation for a new growth wave with the first global target of $1.65. This is the beginning of the formation of a broad global consolidation and is a positive scenario for the ADA market. Otherwise, breaking the $0.71 mark will bring the Cardano market to $0.4.

On Stargate, DeFi users can swap native assets cross-chain in a single transaction. Users can exchange USDC on Ethereum for USDT on BNB. At the application level, Stargate is used to create native cross-chain transactions. For instance, your favourite DEX can use Stargate to do one-transaction cross-chain swaps (for example, switching FTM for ETH in one transaction, all from your favourite DEX&apos;s user interface). Stargate may be built using your favourite yield aggregator to deploy assets cross-chain, resulting in additional APY opportunities. The community-owned Stargate unified liquidity pools support these cross-chain swaps. The first bridge to answer the bridging trilemma is Stargate. Existing bridges do not have the following basic bridge features which Stargate provides to their users: Instant Finality: Users and applications may be confident that they will immediately arrive on the destination chain when they successfully commit a transaction on the source chain. Native Assets: Users and applications swap in native assets rather than wrapped ones, requiring multiple swaps and payments to obtain the desired object.

However, this is owing to the figures used to determine the TVL that is aired to the general audience. Cardano Founder Says, Count Staked ADA Cardano may not be considered a pioneer in the DeFi field, but it is at the top of the list when it comes to the networks with the highest percentages of staked supply. Cardano has already seen billions of dollars committed on the network, with more than 72 percent of the total supply invested. But why isn&apos;t this factored into official TVL figures? Staking ADA on the Cardano network, unlike most smart contract platforms, does not require a user to lock their assets for any period of time. Simply, while ADA holders can earn incentives for their staked coins, they can also move them whenever they wish. This does not appear to qualify these staked coins to be tallied for calculating a network&apos;s TVL. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson highlighted this mismatch in a recent tweet, explaining that if the number of staked ADA were counted regardless of whether they were locked or not, Cardano&apos;s TVL would be substantially greater. According to Hoskinson, the network&apos;s TVL would be moreover $19 billion if this was done.

On May 5, the Office of Foreign Assets Control updated its &apos;Specially Designated Nationals&apos; list to include Blender&apos;s various website domains as well as a slew of digital currency addresses. Blender is known for being a tool that hackers use to launder money, and it has been linked to several cyber assaults sponsored by the North Korean government. While this may not be the end of crypto mixers, it is certainly a step in the right direction for deterring future cybercrime. It remains to be seen what effect, if any, the U.S. sanctions will have on Blender and other crypto mixing platforms. Blender, for example, is a platform that allows users to mix and match virtual currencies without revealing their transaction history. A crypto mixer usually combines transactions together and sends them out to new addresses, thus allowing someone to deposit coins and withdraw them from a &apos;clean&apos; address, which makes it significantly more difficult to trace their financial transactions on a public blockchain ledger.

On Nov 10, 2021, it attained an all-time high price of $68,789.63 according to CoinMarketCap but is trading at $36,445.62 at the time of writing. Many believed that before the end of the first quarter of 2022, it might have hit the $100,000 mark. This seems to be far from being achieved. With one month already gone in the second quarter of 2022, and we have been in the second month, we shall look into some of the reasons why Bitcoin might not break its present all-time high value of $68,789.63 in May 2022. Some of the reasons are: Due to Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) In the past few days, over 1 million Bitcoin (BTC) had been sold. This selling pressure is due to the recently increased rate by the United States Federal Reserve. Traders and investors are trying to reduce the impact of the present market downtrend on their portfolios. If these negative sentiments continue, we should expect the price of Bitcoin to fall further. Bitcoin&apos;s inability to hold support at $37,500 Traders have watched to see if Bitcoin could hold support at about $37,500. However, in the past 24 hours at the time of time, it&apos;s minimum and maximum prices attained are $35,856.52 and $39,620.88 respectively.

Tron had announced in the past weeks, that, it is soon to be going live with its algorithmic stable coin USDD. Ever since this development, the anticipation caused prices of TRX to surge. TRX has been one of the top gainers in the industry. The bullish stance has made the coin go past its immediate price ceiling and pushed the coin to eye its next resistance mark.
