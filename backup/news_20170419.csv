42427471,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVfLh,1492641015,The IMF Just Finished its First 'High Level' Meeting on Blockchain,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the first-ever meeting of its High Level Advisory Group on FinTech today, a group that features a significant contingent of senior-level blockchain executives.  In total, 14 participants attended a panel leading up to a closed-door session with IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, seven of whom represented companies in the blockchain industry.  Attendees included Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, Jill Carlson, head of market strategy at Chain, Chris Church, chief business development officer at Digital Asset, and Ryan Zagone, director of regulatory relations at Ripple, among others.  While the meeting itself wasn't public, the panel was both streamed by the IMF and live-tweeted, marking what panelist Alex Tapscott, author of ""Blockchain Revolution"", described to CoinDesk as a shift in the way global policy should be determined going forward.  Unlike the Bretton Woods agreements that pegged the price of global currencies to gold, Tapscott noted today's meeting wasn't held exclusively in ""smoky, wood-paneled chambers between global elites"".  Tapscott told CoinDesk:  ""There's a convening power that the IMF has, and I think they should bring together central bank governors. But also, the process should be transparent and it should be inclusive and that people from outside of central banking should be able to provide their input on what needs to be done.""  Initially announced in March, the advisory group also consists of members from the blockchain industry including Chris Larsen, the executive chairman of Ripple, Adam Ludwin from Chain, Blythe Masters from Digital Asset, Patrick Murck from the Harvard Berkman Klein Center, and Marco Santori, partner at Cooley LLP.  Tapscott described the overall attitude of the meeting as ""very positive"", estimating 80% of the conversation focused on blockchain, while 15% centered on machine learning and 5% covered other technologies.  Additional participants included Tao Zhang, deputy managing director of the IMF and former deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, Carolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor at the Bank of Canada, Long Chen, chief strategy officer of Alibaba's Ant Financial Services and Robert Garrison, the DTCC's CIO, among others.  Collectively, the group has been tasked to work with the IMF's Interdepartmental Working Group on Finance and Technology, established in 2016 to study the economic and regulatory implications of blockchain and other developments in financial technology.  ""This is not a blockchain group, per se,"" said Tapscott. ""It is a fintech group, and yet a majority of people who are on this board are actually from the world of blockchain.""  'Nothing to see'  Following a series of meetings throughout the day, Chain's Jill Carlson described the conversation as more of a dialogue than a question-and-answer session.  She added in general terms that the meeting attendees looked at regulatory structures they might want to explore with the IMF, central banks and international financial institutions.  In addition to discussing the benefits of the technology should the IMF and others decide to embrace blockchain, Carlson said they also weighed the risks its wider use could bring.  Though Carson refrained from going into too many details about the specific items discussed, she said ""there's not much happening behind the scenes to see"".  She added:  ""It's looking to be transparent and really act in the spirit of the technology, which is democratizing financial services.""  IMF and the blockchain  Yet, the meeting is notable as the IMF's willingness to explore the largely experimental technology comes amid a turbulent time for the global economy.  Yesterday, the IMF released its World Economic Outlook, in which it forecast a global economy that is ""gaining momentum – for now"", but also expressed concern over the potential negative implications of increasingly nationalistic behaviors.  It is against that backdrop that the IMF has taken an increasingly public stance regarding blockchain.  Last January, the IMF published a paper supporting pro-cryptocurrency regulation, and earlier this year, it co-hosted a blockchain seminar with Dubai's Ministry of Finance focused on blockchain and digital currencies.  Piece or the pie?  Still, according to Tapscott, the lion's share of blockchain companies on the IMF's financial technology advisory group is evidence of a shift in the perception of blockchain.  Whereas blockchain was previously viewed as a subset of fintech, Tapscott argues that innovators from industries including artificial intelligence, virtual reality, social media and cloud now see blockchain as the ""transaction infrastructure"" that could tie all this tech together.  Tapscott concluded:  ""It's this much larger technology that, in addition to being the basis for a lot of the innovation that I think will happen in financial services, is also something that could change basically every industry in the world.""

42427464,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVeph,1492626306,Nasdaq Wants to Invest in More Blockchain Startups,"Exchange operator Nasdaq is looking to invest in blockchain startups as part of a new venture initiative.  Nasdaq Ventures, announced today, has set its sight on investing in companies that work with blockchain, as well as firms focused on artificial intelligence, next-generation data analysis and machine learning. The firm will invest as much as $10m in relevant startups, focusing on both seed-stage and late-stage placements.  The effort is perhaps a natural extension of the exchange operator's work in the blockchain space. In mid-2015, Nasdaq partnered with blockchain startup Chain in an effort that saw the two jointly develop a distributed ledger market focused on pre-IPO offerings.  Adena Friedman, president and CEO of Nasdaq, said in a statement:  ""With the launch of our new venture investment program, we are reinforcing our focus on driving growth and innovation by evaluating, distributing, licensing and integrating disruptive technologies for the long-term benefit of our global clients.""  The operator has been testing blockchain elsewhere as well.  In February 2016, Nasdaq revealed it was testing a blockchain e-voting prototype with Estonia's sole securities exchange. Further, in January, Nasdaq released a report outlining that, in its view, the trial ""successfully demonstrated"" why it believes blockchain use cases will extend beyond transaction settlement.

42427456,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVexh,1492622706,Cornell Prof: Blockchain Exuberance Shouldn't Cloud Consequences,"The blockchain industry needs pragmatism – not idealism.  That was the focus behind a talk given by Cornell University associate professor Emin Gün Sirer at Business of Blockchain, a one-day conference held by MIT Tech Review and the MIT Media Lab yesterday. There, Sirer discussed the idea that while blockchains can be immutable, at some point in time, all cryptocurrency development teams have faced situations where they had to go back and rewrite the past.  ""I'm here to tell you code is not law. You know what is the law? The law is the law,"" Sirer told the crowd. ""The code is buggy. That is what we have today.""  As an example, even bitcoin, he pointed out, has seen its fair share of snafus.  Sirer cited two instances, one in 2010, when a bug in bitcoin's code led to the creation of 92m bitcoins (thereby breaking the hard-coded rule that only 21m bitcoin will ever exist), and another in 2013, when the bitcoin network split after a bug in the software created two divergent chains.  He also touched on the infamous hack on The DAO, an event last summer that ultimately led the ethereum smart contract platform to hard fork, and the role his team played in helping to review The DAO's smart contract code and warn the community about its effects.  The DAO was an example of how exuberant people can become over the the potential of blockchains, which are, like every other software program, fallible.  Reminders ring  While much of his talk focused on public blockchains, Sirer went on to give guidance for developers in all areas of the industry today.  Exchanges where cryptocurrencies are traded (along with our mobile phones and computers that interface with them), he said, are simply not built for handling high value digital assets.  Further, he said private blockchains that use byzantine fault tolerant protocols are ""doing it wrong"", stating:  ""All of your nodes must fail independently, and yet you are deploying the same code on every machine.""  He later clarified this could create situations where issues with smart contract code held on private blockchain networks could cause all the computers in the network to be compromised.  Another problem, Sirer said, is that smart contracts are being coded in languages too similar to Javascript, making it difficult for coders to spot mistakes or to predict whether a smart contact will work the way it is intended.  Sirer ended his talk by stating that while blockchain is an exciting field, it needs to be approached in a rational, scientific manner that takes failure into account.  He said:  ""There is a great promise at the end, but there will be many failures.""

42427460,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVezh,1492617045,OKCoin Becomes Latest Bitcoin Exchange to Freeze US Dollar Deposits,"Chinese digital currency exchange OKCoin has stopped accepting US dollar deposits, a move it attributed to banking issues.  OKCoin becomes the latest cryptocurrency service to report problems with USD transfers, coming just a day after Bitfinex revealed that it, too, wouldn’t be able to accept transfers, citing correspondent bank problems that initially focused on outgoing wires.  When reached, an online support staffer for OKCoin told CoinDesk that the exchange currently doesn’t have an exact timeline for reactivation. The exchange told users yesterday that it was working to restore deposit functions through alternative channels.  ""Please do not make further deposits as your wires may be rejected by intermediary banks,"" a notice posted on the exchange’s website stated.  The move comes months after OKCoin, as well as other exchanges based in China, shifted policies in light of new regulatory scrutiny and later froze bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals pending upgrades to their systems. That state of affairs continues, a situation local sources have attributed to ongoing discussions with the People’s Bank of China (China’s central bank) and other regulators in the country.  It also follows the release by OKCoin of beefed up anti-money laundering/know-your-customer requirements on 10th April.  Other exchanges have reported transfer holds as well, though how the developments are connected isn't immediately clear. Crypto-exchange BTC-e, for example, said that it wouldn’t accept international transfers in USD for the next month, citing a shift to a new bank account in a post on Twitter from 14th April.

BNP Paribas Securities Services is working with investment manager AXA on the platform, with the stated goal of developing a more streamlined mechanism, in terms of client onboarding, for funds sales. Fund Link, as the platform is called, is expected to open to prospective customers ""in the near future"", the bank said.  The unveiling comes more than a year after the subsidiary launched an innovation lab aimed, in part, at testing blockchain applications. BNP itself has pursued uses of the tech, including international payments and bond issuance.  Jean Devambez, head of product and client solutions for BNP Paribas Securities Services’ Asset and Fund Services unit, said in a statement:  ""There are so many new and exciting ways technology can enhance the fund distribution process. With this platform we aim to bring many of them together to streamline fund distribution, create efficiencies and ultimately lower client costs.""  Though BNP didn’t offer a specific timeline for when it would begin onboarding clients to the platform, the bank indicated that it would become operational this year.

42427461,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVf5h,1492606750,"Cisco, Bosch Reveal New Details on IoT-Blockchain Projects","Following a formal unveiling in January, members of a consortium focused on the intersection of blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT) are revealing new details about their work.  Announced today, the unnamed group, which includes Bosch, BNY Mellon, Chronicled, Filament and other startup and enterprise firms, has created an API that supports technologies offered by ethereum, JP Morgan's Quorum and the Linux-led Hyperledger project.  ""The protocol allows users to register multiple kinds of weaker identities, including serial numbers, QR codes, and UPC code identities and bind them to stronger cryptographic identities, which are immutably linked across both physical and digital worlds using blockchain technology,"" the release reads.  The software development kits (SDKs) are currently in beta, and are available via the Chronicled and Hyperledger libraries on GitHub.  As explained by Skuchain founder Zaki Manian, the tools now enable the same key pair to represent a cryptographic identity compatible with both blockchains.  Further, Cisco and Bosch offered new information about how they are using blockchain technologies in proof-of-concept projects.  Cisco, a release from the group said, is exploring how it could register device identities using the API, while Bosch is said to have completed a trial centered on linking odometer readings to a blockchain system.

42399756,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbydmS,1492603149,A New Tool Might Finally Make Banks Comfortable With Bitcoin,"Bitcoin intelligence provider Elliptic is rolling out a program with California-based Silvergate Bank to analyze and screen possible nefarious activity on the bitcoin blockchain.  The effort is focused on helping banks assess future bitcoin-based business clients. For banks, often the associated risks are deemed higher than the potential rewards when considering new clients that operate in the bitcoin space – an often-cited stumbling block in the industry.  ""The banks that are working with bitcoin companies really don’t have much visibility into how effective they are at handling the risk associated with bitcoin transactions,"" said James Smith, Elliptic's CEO.  Smith told CoinDesk:  ""Until now, they pretty much have had to rely on the word of the exchange or whoever [processed the transaction] to say 'We’re doing the best we can.'""  Elliptic's software allows financial institutions to take a more robust approach in vetting bitcoin businesses and complying with know-your-customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML) and Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requirements.  The platform will help banks find suspicious bitcoin activity, allowing them to reduce risk assessment costs for current and potential customers, while demonstrating to regulators that there are internal safeguards in place to weed out bad actors.  ""We see this as a great step forward in terms of raising the industry standard, in terms of compliance, improving the level of risk mitigation and, ultimately, allowing Silvergate to work with more businesses who are handling bitcoin,"" said Smith.  Silver lining  While beneficial in this regard, Silvergate is already one of the exceptions to the rule in the banking world when it comes to bitcoin. The bank currently provides services to more than 30 bitcoin-related companies, including digital currency exchanges, institutional investors, miners and software developers.  Still, those involved in the project argue better visibility will in turn aid banks as the regulatory environment moves to one where banks are now responsible for their customer's customers as well.  Plus, Silvergate and Elliptic argue that the platform will allow financial institutions to better assess when their customers' internal controls may be suspect.  ""What we’re looking for is to see how a client is performing over time as an indication of whether their internal control environment is getting stronger,"" said Ben Reynolds, vice president of business development and digital banking at Silvergate.  Similar to Elliptic's other anti-money laundering products, the platform screens each blockchain transaction for potential linkages to suspicious activity and then issues each with a risk score.  Proactive push  While efforts to separate the allegedly 'good' bitcoin users from the 'bad' ones have been met with pushback from certain factions of the bitcoin community, Elliptic and Silvergate emphasize that the goal is not to micromanage clients, but rather to understand holistically what clients are doing to filter out eyebrow-raising activity.  ""What they want to know is – at a high level – what percentage of transactions going through this business are suspicious? How has that changed over time? Does it look like they are improving their controls?"" said Smith.  The bottom line, Reynolds said, is that the software will soften Silvergate’s overall risk management overhead. ""For us, each client that we take on initially is a pretty large investment in terms of the due diligence process that we go through,"" he said.  Reynolds went on to explain that while Silvergate has no regulatory obligation to enact such a program, it's being proactive to advance the legitimacy, credibility and sustainability of the bitcoin industry and pushback on negative stereotypes.  Smith concluded:  ""With this extra visibility, they’re able to understand how effective these companies are at handling risk and therefore get more comfortable with the idea of banking them.""

42399763,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbydsM,1492599646,Land Registry: A Big Blockchain Use Case Explored,"With distributed ledger technology being promoted as a benefit to everything from farming to Fair Trade coffee, use case investigation has emerged as a full-time fascination for many.  In this light, one popular blockchain use case that has remained generally outside scrutiny has been land title projects started in countries including in Georgia, Sweden and the Ukraine.  One could argue land registries seemed to become newsworthy only after work on the use case had begun. However, those working on projects disagree, asserting that land registries could prove one of the first viable beachheads for blockchain.  Elliot Hedman, chief operating officer of Bitland Global, the technology partner for a real estate title registration program in Ghana, for example, said that issues with land rights make it a logical fit.  Hedman told CoinDesk:  ""As for the benefit of a blockchain-based land registry, look to Haiti. There are still people fighting over whose land is whose. When disaster struck, all of their records were on paper, that being if they were written down at all.""  Hedman argued that, with a blockchain-based registry employing a network of distributed databases as a way to facilitate data exchange, the ""monumental headache"" associated with a recovery effort would cease.  Modern real estate  To understand the potential of a blockchain land registry system, analysts argue one must first understand how property changes hands.  When a purchaser seeks to buy property today, he or she must find and secure the title and have the lawful owner sign it over.  This seems simple on the surface, but the devil is in the details. For a large number of residential mortgage holders, flawed paperwork, forged signatures and defects in foreclosure and mortgage documents have marred proper documentation of property ownership.  The problem is so acute that Bank of America attempted foreclosure on properties for which it did not have mortgages in the wake of the financial crisis.  Readers may also recall the proliferation of NINJA (No Income, No Job or Assets) subprime loans during the Great Recession and how this practice created a flood of distressed assets that banks were simply unable to handle.  The resulting situation means that the property no longer has a 'good title' attached to it and is no longer legally sellable, leaving the prospective buyer in many cases with no remedies.  Economic booster  Land registry blockchains seek to fix these problems.  By using hashes to identify every real estate transaction (thus making it publicly available and searchable), proponents argue issues such as who is the legal owner of a property can be remedied.  ""Land registry records are pretty reliable methods for maintaining land records, but they are expensive and inefficient,"" David Reiss, professor of law and academic program director at the Center for Urban Business Entrepreneurship, told CoinDesk.  He explained:  ""There is good reason to think that blockchain technology could serve as the basis for a more reliable, cheaper and more efficient land registry.""  Over time, Reiss is optimistic that this could restore economic activity that he argues has been depressed since the housing crisis.  ""When people and organizations do not have to worry about the legitimacy of their investments in property, they will have no problem investing in increasing the value of their properties,"" he said.  Macro concerns  Outside of the US, though, problems with titling become more pronounced.  In some countries, government actions, unethical interventions from corporations and the destructive actions of Mother Nature compound the difficulty of getting a 'good title'.  In Haiti, for example, natural disasters, forced evacuations and the corruption of dictatorships have made the prospect of figuring out who actually owns the land one lives on impossible.  Likewise, in the Gaza Strip, the current land speculation is bedeviled by conflicting claims by both the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority, as well as the possible intervention of third-parties.  ""Land title issues are very complex by default due to different international standards,"" Reiss said, adding:  ""You throw in the nuances of post colonial-states and corruption, then you find that clearly a solution is needed, and the idea that blockchain land registries are nothing but a ‘solution seeking a problem’ is clearly removed from reality.""  Compounding matters is that, for most individuals, creditworthiness is determined by their homes and real estate properties.  Without a clear line of ownership, tools for financial mobility – such as seed loans for new businesses – cannot be obtained, leaving affected communities with few options for improving their fortunes.  Authenticity not accuracy  That's not to say that the same design considerations aren't being approached by innovators in the developed world.  John Mirkovic, the deputy recorder for communications for the Cook County Recorder of Deeds, indicated that the county's upcoming findings would address 'nuisance properties' and the possibility of land title fraud.  A blockchain registry, advocates say, would make it easier to locate nuisance properties, such as properties seized on tax liens, abandoned properties and properties without 'good titles' – all likely targets for fraud.  As argued by the Vermont legislature in its position paper on blockchain use, such a system cannot be used to address the accuracy of the titles, but rather seeks to clarify the authenticity of the title.  ""Blockchain technology offers no assistance in terms of the reliability or accuracy of the records contained in the blockchain; if bad data is used as an input, as long as the correct protocols are utilized, it will be accepted by the network and added to the blockchain,"" the report notes.  It goes on to conclude, however, that the tech could have real benefits.  New world order  Such innovations are not in a silo, however, and come at a time when governments are increasingly considering getting out of the land registry business altogether.  In Australia’s New South Wales, the government has sold management rights to its land title registry for AUS$2.6bn, placing the ownership mechanism for the state's residential real estate in the hands of a hedge fund.  NSW, though, is far from alone in its desire to push its land registry problems onto others.  In Canada, both Ontario and Manitoba have leased management of their registries to Toronto-based Teranet, though privatization in Canada saw a steep increase in registration.  While other jurisdictions may be hesitant to give up land registries, though, entrepreneurs are optimistic about the possibility.  ""The blockchain is not a panacea, but it is the best tool we have to fight corruption and inefficiency,"" Bates said, concluding:  ""The blockchain is not going to 'replace government' concerning how land is registered and monitored. It will make governance of land registration the simplest and most corruption resistant possible.""

42399757,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbydnR,1492596025,Arizona's Blockchain Gun Tracking Bill is Close to Becoming Law,"Arizona legislators have completed a bill that seeks to prevent blockchains from being used as a tool for trackarms tracking.  First filed by an Arizona state representative in mid-January, House Bill 2216 seeks to stop anyone – save for law enforcement or other exempt entities – from using blockchain tech to track when a gun is fired, for example. More broadly, the measure focuses on potential targets of gun-tracking through the use of ""electronic firearm tracking technology"" – a term that, as the text goes on to explain, would include blockchain.  As detailed in the bill:  ""For the purposes of this section, 'Electronic Firearm Tracking Technology' means a platform, system or group of systems or devices that uses a shared ledger, distributed ledger or block chain technology or similar form of technology or electronic database for the purpose of storing information in a decentralized or centralized way, that is not owned or controlled by any single person or entity and that is used to locate or control the use of a firearm.""  As shown in public records, the bill moved quickly through the Arizona House of Representatives after being entered, but hit a roadblock in the upper chamber. Ultimately, though, the bill advanced.  The senate passed the measure by a 17-12 vote (with one member abstaining). And, yesterday, the House gave its blessing in a 34-24 vote, after which the bill was sent to Governor Doug Ducey for signature.  This will be the second bill completed in Arizona this year that has focused on blockchain technology. The first, signed by Governor Ducey at the end of March, recognizes blockchain-based signatures and smart contracts under state law.

42399768,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbydvJ,1492592408,US Dollars on the Blockchain? Fed VP Says Not Yet at MIT Event,"The idea that blockchains could be used to launch a digital fiat currency isn't new – in fact, it's already been considered by monetary authorities in countries like England and China.  But as far as applying the concept to the US market, Jim Cunha, senior vice president of treasury and financial services at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, believes there are better opportunities for the technology in banking.  ""I would not call the central bank's currency the low-hanging fruit here,"" Cunha said, addressing the audience at Business of Blockchain, a conference organized by MIT Technology Review and the MIT Media Lab, yesterday.  Cunha went on to say that while blockchain tech offers potential for efficiency, there are too many technical and legal problems to overcome first, one of those being how to deal with issues of finality, which he referred to as the ""holy grail"" of financial services.  Cunha told the audience:  ""A wire transfer is irrevocable. The Fed would never, ever reverse it. Banks count on that. There is the reason why when you get a mortgage, your lawyer is waiting for the bank to say the wire transfer has been deposited. Because when they sign that piece of paper, which is the deed, that house is yours.""  He pointed to The DAO hard fork as an example of how a blockchain's decentralized decision making could potentially pose a real issue for banks.  ""Just imagine if all the banks got together and said if 51% of you decide to reverse a wire, then we’ll do it,"" he said.  Other issues to consider, the Fed official continued, were how a blockchain could impact the trust and risk models of a currency. Because a distributed ledger effectively eliminates the middle person, banks would have to consider a different legal structure.  ""This is big, complicated stuff,"" he said.  Defining the problem  While a lot of hype surrounds blockchain, Cunha noted that it is not simply a matter of trying to address a solution. First, he said, you have to step back and define the problem.  He told CoinDesk:  ""A lot people take a leap that, just because it is a digital currency, it is the next thing beyond paper, because paper is so passé. But what is the problem we are trying to solve?""  In his opinion, the ""money supply of the biggest economy in the world"" isn't the right place to start the process.  Instead, Cunha noted on stage, stocks, derivatives and trade agreements are better opportunities for applying blockchain to reduce friction and costs.  No plans for 'FedCoin'  Cunha also dismissed rumors of a 'FedCoin', a theoretical digital fiat currency that sprung out of a paper written by an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis in 2015.  ""Right now, I can tell you categorically, there is no plan to issue a FedCoin at any specific date or time,"" he said.  But Robleh Ali, a research scientist at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative who formerly worked at the Bank of England, pointed out that different central banks do things differently.  It is perfectly conceivable, Ali said, that technology for a digital fiat currency could evolve outside of the banking system and later be adopted by banks after it had matured and proven itself.  ""I think ultimately you will see digital fiat currencies as a foundation for a financial system,"" he said, concluding:  ""You may be talking about a 20- or 30-year time horizon for that.""
