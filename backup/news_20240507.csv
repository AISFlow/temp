A Surge In Dogecoin Profitable Addresses Recent data from IntoTheBlock reveals a notable uptick in the profitability of Dogecoin addresses. Of the myriad wallets in the Dogecoin ecosystem, roughly 82.66%, representing approximately 5.21 million addresses, are currently profitable. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Out Of Descending Triangle Like It Did In 2021, Analyst Sets $6 Target According to data from IntoTheBlock, the profitability price range remains between $0.143 and $0.150. Conversely, a smaller segment of the network, about 13.5% or 850,400 addresses, remains in the red. These addresses are positioned to turn profitable if Dogecoin’s market price is between $0.183 and $0.671. An intriguing midpoint exists where approximately 3.83% of addresses, totaling 241,340, will break even if prices reach between $0.150 and $0.167. DOGE’s Market Dynamics And Future Prospects Despite the positive sentiment, Dogecoin’s journey is not devoid of challenges and speculative dynamics. The meme coin, often buoyed by social media trends and celebrity endorsements, particularly from figures like Elon Musk, is gaining traction through technical milestones and broader ecosystem developments. Analytical experts like Ali have pointed out significant patterns on Dogecoin’s charts that echo its historical rallies. Notably, Ali identifies a recurring descending triangle breakout akin to those seen before substantial price surges in 2017 and 2021. Related Reading: Brace For Price Impact: Dogecoin Whales Move Massive 456 Million DOGE To Exchanges If historical patterns hold true, Dogecoin might revisit its all-time high and potentially exceed it, with targets set ambitiously at $1.2 and even $6 in the ongoing bull cycle.

It is currently undergoing a 47% price correction, very similar to previous cycles, which could ignite the next $DOGE bull run! pic.twitter.com/ZmuHmvIwei — Ali (@ali_charts) May 1, 2024 Furthermore, sentiments from market analysts like Altcoin Sherpa reinforce the bullish outlook for Dogecoin. Sherpa’s analysis, based on long-term consolidation phases and current market positioning, suggests that Dogecoin could outperform other cryptocurrencies significantly this year. Sherpa noted: DOGE is looking good. I strongly feel like this is going to be a strong coin for 2024. I think averaging between $.12 and $.14 would be a solid play and this one should outperform many other tokens for a lot of reasons. It chopped for almost 2 years, it’s going to moon later. Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s price has recently experienced a notable uptick, rising over 10% in the past week. However, in the last 24 hours, it has slightly declined by 2.4%, trading at $0.155 at the time of writing.

27102361,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606944,1715119247,AI Tokens ‘Preparing For Round 2’: Industry Shows 8% Growth With RNDR And FET,"Excluding Bitcoin, memecoins were the biggest narrative of this cycle. However, Artificial Intelligence (AI) tokens also performed remarkably during the first quarter of 2024. The crypto market recovered over the weekend from the May 1st retrace, with AI tokens showing significant gains. As a result, many industry experts think that the sector is poised for a ‘Round 2’ this cycle. Related Reading: Analysts Foresee Altcoins ‘Explosive Rally’ Incoming, Is The Correction Phase Over? AI Sector Recovers By 8% Crypto analysts highlighted AI tokens alongside memecoins as the hottest topic of 2024, responsible for most of the massive gains during this cycle. According to CoinGecko’s report, AI was one of the three sectors that delivered three-digit returns in Q1. Moreover, the largest AI token by market capitalization, Fetch.ai (FET), saw gains of 378.3% during this period. As a result, some analysts deem the AI sector to be the next main narrative of the cycle. Trader John Walsh, known as CryptoGodJohn, considers “The future of AI coins preparing round 2.” Walsh added that the AI season is “extremely obvious” and will go “so much higher” based on the developments in the sectors, including Nvidia earnings, Apple AI, and Microsoft’s $100 billion AI fund. To this, crypto analyst MacroCRG replied that a massive AI growth “will be obvious in hindsight,” considering that the sector’s market capitalization is “just” $27.3 billion. AI mcap still just $27B It will be obvious in hindsight https://t.co/HH0Tb86fNY pic.twitter.com/71qgdwdM1C — CRG (@MacroCRG) May 6, 2024 According to a MacroCRG post, the AI market cap had increased 8% by Monday morning, and its daily trading volume was around $1.9 billion. On Tuesday, the market cap surged to $27.8 billion, a 2.3% increase from 24 hours ago. In comparison, memecoins $54.4 billion market cap doubles AI’s. However, its market cap decreased by 2.8% in the last day, with the top ten memecoins showing red numbers in the past 24 hours. Is Artificial Intelligence About To Bloom Or Ruin the World? Despite the remarkable performance, some figures think the sector has a more pessimistic future. According to memecoin trader Murad, the developments in the industry will “be replacing more & more jobs every year.” As a result, there will be an increase in “Anxieties and desperate attempts to ‘make it.’” To the trader, the industry will serve as a push for the memecoins sector, as “Growing AI capabilities will be one of the big forces accelerating the Memecoin Bubble.” Financial giant Warren Buffett shared a more skeptical view on Saturday. The Co-founder and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway revealed he is not sold yet by artificial intelligence. To the CEO: We let a genie out of the bottle when we developed nuclear weapons. AI is somewhat similar — it’s part way out of the bottle. Despite this, Buffet recognized the potential for AI technology to change the world positively. On The Brink Of A Millionaire Boom “The AI industry is on the brink of a multi-trillion-dollar boom,” stated Alex Wacy. The analyst believes the reasons behind this are the vast and diverse potential of applications. Moreover, the expert highlights that interest in the sector has steadily increased over the last year. A crypto and AI combination could potentially “create a market valued in the trillions.” According to the post, the market is projected to reach nearly $2 trillion by 2030, which suggests that the crypto industry should not overlook it. Tokens like RNDR showed a remarkable performance over the past week, with the price soaring by 45%. RNDR regained the $10 support zone this week after struggling to retest it over the last month. In the past 24 hours, the token’s price surged 6.4%, and its daily trading volume increased by 16.8%, with over $455 million being traded. FET is “a top performing AI coin headed into the Nvidia earnings,” as stated by John Walsh. The trader forecast that the token is “looking for a next leg higher up” after successfully retesting the $2.35 resistance level. $FET break retest now looking for next leg up higher FET will be a top performing AI coin headed into the nvidia earnings pic.twitter.com/Agl0eqB9mD — Johnny (@CryptoGodJohn) May 6, 2024 FET broke above this level over the weekend, rising to $2.5 on Monday and remaining above the $2.40 support zone since.

Fragile Fundamentals Threaten To Send ETH Crashing","Ethereum has put on a disappointing performance for its investors over the last few weeks, leading to concerns on whether the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has lost its shine. The cryptocurrency continues to skirt around the $3,100 level, not making any significant breaks upward. This points to weak fundamentals that could trigger a price decline. Ethereum Fails To Make Meaningful Moves Markus Thielen, Head of Research at 10x Research, has pointed out some worrying developments with the Ethereum price. In a new report shared with NewsBTC, he explains that despite Ethereum remaining highly correlated to Bitcoin with an R-Square of 95%, it continues to perform poorly while the latter has made new all-time highs. Related Reading: Here’s Why This Crypto Analyst Believes Bitcoin Is At A ‘Prime Buy Zone’ Thielen points back to ETH’s performance in the last bull market, which was closely tied to new sectors popping out of the network, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This caused demand to skyrocket, and in turn, the price followed as users gobbled up ETH for the high gas fee required to transact on the blockchain. However, Ethereum has failed to maintain this momentum, which can be attributed to its inability to bring the upgrades that users needed in time. Thielen explains that the Dencun upgrade which helped solved the high gas fee issues had come three years too late because by 2024 when the upgrade arrived, users had moved on to Layer 2 networks. Also, during this time, other Layer 1 networks have seen a rise in users and Solana is one example of this. Source: 10x Research The researcher further explained that the weak fundamentals of ETH are now not only affecting its price but has had a spillover effect to Bitcoin. “Ethereum’s weak fundamentals are becoming a roadblock for Bitcoin as they prevent broad fiat inflow into the crypto ecosystem,” Thielen stated. Better To Short ETH Thielen’s analysis of Ethereum also spreads to the drop in stablecoin usage on the network. Back in 2021, Ethereum had dominated stablecoin transactions such as USDT and USDC. However, it seems like, with other things, the high fees have driven users towards other networks. Blockchains such as Tron (TRX) are now dominating stablecoin transactions, leaving ETH in the dust. Additionally, there is also the fact that ETH’s issuance is turning inflationary once again. After the London Hard Fork, also known as EIP-1559, was completed in 2021, the network saw its issuance turn deflationary for the first time as ETH burned quickly surpassed ETH being brought into circulation. Related Reading: Crypto Whale Spends $10.4 Million On PEPE, Do They Know Something You Don’t? However, this has now changed in the past months as there have been more ETH issued than those burned, Thielen notes. To put this in perspective, a total of 74,000 ETH were issued compared to only 43,000 ETH burned. This inflation, coupled with the fact that staking rewards have now dropped to 3%, below the 5.1% offered by Treasury Yields, Ethereum has had a hard time maintaining bullish sentiment. Given these developments, the researcher believes it is better to be bearish on Ethereum right now. “Right now, we would be more comfortable holding a short position in ETH than a long one in BTC as Ethereum’s fundamentals are fragile, which is not yet reflected in ETH prices,” Thielen concludes.

42390857,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPFrn,1715115302,"BlackRock, Ondo, Superstate: The Biggest Movers in the RWA Sector in Q1","Real-world assets (RWAs) are one of the fastest emerging sectors in crypto. In essence, they are traditional financial assets, like Treasury bills, that have been tokenized to interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.  Ryan Rodenbaugh is the CEO and co-founder of Wallfacer Labs.  RWAs allow for the blending of traditional finance with blockchain technology, enabling broader liquidity and innovative financial products.  The previous quarter saw the RWA market grow by leaps and bounds. Tokenized Treasury bills including BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, Superstate's Short Duration US Government Securities Fund, and Ondo's USDY grew by an impressive 41% to nearly $1.3 billion, driven by significant institutional interest and innovative product launches. Let’s recap the key developments and trends in the sector.  Institutional interest and new products spur growth  Much of the growth in the sector has come from major institutions entering the arena.  BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, launched an on-chain Treasuries product that quickly amassed $280 million in deposits. Superstate, a new crypto-native asset management firm founded by Compound Finance's Robert Leshner, debuted a tokenized T-bill fund that attracted $82 million.  These initiatives highlight the increasing confidence and interest in RWAs from traditional finance and crypto-natives alike.  Existing RWA players have also expanded their offerings. Ondo Finance shifted deposits into its new USDY product. Centrifuge, a platform for tokenizing real-world assets, saw steady growth in assets under management for the second straight quarter.  See also: Franklin Templeton Upgrades $380M Tokenized Treasury Fund  But beyond growth in assets, we're seeing the emergence of infrastructure to make RWAs more accessible and composable with the broader DeFi ecosystem. Superstate aims to leverage blockchain tech for increased speed, programmability and compliance. M^0 Labs is developing a way to generate digital cash from high-quality off-chain collateral that can then be used as a building block for other products. Ondo Global Markets envisions a two-way system to seamlessly move assets between on-chain tokens and off-chain accounts.  Centrifuge continued to expand its platform for tokenizing real-world assets, maintaining steady growth in its assets under management for another consecutive quarter. These developments underscore the ongoing efforts to enhance the infrastructure supporting RWAs.  Developing trends and the future  DeFi protocols are finding ways to incorporate RWA yields. Morpho enables managers to create non-custodial vaults that pass on RWA yields to DeFi users. TrueFi, a longstanding credit protocol, is launching Trinity to let users deposit tokenized T-Bills as collateral to mint a dollar-pegged asset usable across DeFi. This addresses the growing demand among DeFi users for enhanced composability and transferability in RWA products.  Integrating RWAs into DeFi in a scalable, user-friendly way has long been a challenge and key unlock. But pieces are starting to come together, with major institutions driving inflows, new primitives being built, and greater interoperability with existing DeFi infrastructure.  See also: BlackRock Enters Asset Tokenization Race With New Fund  While still early, the RWA space is one to watch closely as a potentially significant growth driver for crypto in the coming years. If these trends continue, tokenized real-world assets in the trillions by 2030, as predicted by Superstate's Leshner, may not be so far-fetched after all.

The move could be a strategic decision to propel Polkadot, a smart contracts platform similar to Ethereum, into the global spotlight. Polkadot To Sponsor Inter Miami The proposal, approved by Polkadot’s Open Gov community, sought 968,000 DOT (roughly $6.5 million) to secure the sponsorship. Under the “sports sponsorship fund,” the goal was to partner with Inter Miami, a team described as one of the “world’s most engaging and followed sports teams.” Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Trading Activity Goes Quiet: Will This Drag Down The Price? While the goal is to “elevate” Polkadot’s global brand visibility, the plan is to develop other deeper integration, leveraging Inter Miami’s global fanbase. For instance, the team plans to enhance user experience through engaging non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other gamified experiences deployed on Polkadot’s parachains. Additionally, the team plans to explore how Polkadot-based solutions can be implemented at Inter Miami, resulting in greater efficiency and improved fan engagement initiatives. While the potential deal’s specifics are confidential, the proposal emphasizes transparency. Accordingly, funds will be held in a multi-signature wallet, accessible only with community approval. Moreover, ORSEN SA, a Swiss sports marketing agency, will manage the partnership rights. Polkadot’s Plans to Scale As Polkadot enhances its global visibility, developers are also working on activating a key update: “Asynchronous Backing.” Last year, Sophia Gold, the Engineering Lead at Parity Technologies, said the technology would be a game changer. Asynchronous Backing will allow Polkadot to scale the number of Parachains from 100 to 1,000 by the end of the year. The network will boost its transaction processing capacity, with Polkadot supporting more “independent blockchains” via Parachains. Related Reading: Here’s How This Ethereum Whale Made $16 Million From A Single Trade Furthermore, improvements via techniques like “pipelining” will permit multiple parachains to process data simultaneously, halving transaction confirmation times. Though Polkadot continues to enhance its network and strike more deals, DOT prices remain under pressure. At spot rates, DOT is down 40% from 2024 highs. While CoinMarketCap data shows that the coin has risen 14% in the last week, the failure of bulls to break above $7.5 is a concern. Technically, a high volume lifting the coin above this local liquidation level would pave the road for an expansion toward $9 and March 2024 high in the coming sessions.

27076488,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606941,1715108446,Ethereum’s Wild Fluctuations: Here’s What ETH Implied Volatility Tells Us,"The cryptocurrency market has recently exhibited distinct divergences in the behavior of its two leading assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum. While Bitcoin appears to be stepping into a phase of relative stability, Ethereum’s journey paints a contrasting picture of sustained uncertainty, particularly in its options market. This divergence is highlighted by the sustained high levels of implied volatility associated with Ethereum options, signaling a cautious outlook among investors regarding its future price movements. Related Reading: Ethereum Burn Rate Hits Yearly Low: What This Means For ETH’s Future Ethereum Persisting Volatility: A Comparative Analysis Implied volatility (IV) serves as a crucial indicator in the options market, providing insights into the expected price fluctuations of an asset over a specific period. It reflects the market’s temperature, gauging the intensity of potential price movements traders anticipate. Recent analyses suggest that while Bitcoin’s implied volatility has settled down significantly post-halving, Ethereum’s has not followed suit. As Bitcoin’s IV dipped to a multi-month low, indicating a calming market, Ethereum’s IV remains stubbornly high. Contrary to the calming waves in the Bitcoin market, Ethereum wrestles with heightened volatility. According to data from Bitfinex Alpha Report, Bitcoin’s volatility index sharply declined from 72% at the time of its latest halving event to about 55%. On the other hand, Ethereum saw a more modest reduction in its volatility index, dropping from 76% to 65% in the same period. This persistent volatility in Ethereum’s market is primarily fueled by uncertainties surrounding significant upcoming regulatory decisions and broader market implications. The Ethereum market is particularly jittery in anticipation of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) impending decision on two spot Ethereum ETFs, slated for late May 2024. This upcoming regulatory milestone is considered a critical event that could either catalyze a major market move or exacerbate the current volatility. The Bitfinex Alpha report underscores that regulatory uncertainty is a primary driver behind Ethereum’s less significant drop in its Volatility Risk Premium (VRP) compared to Bitcoin’s. ETH And BTC Show Signs of Recovery Amid Volatility Ethereum and Bitcoin have shown signs of recovery over the past week in terms of trading performance. Bitcoin has seen a 4.1% increase, while Ethereum reported a more modest gain of 2.4%. However, the last 24 hours have been less favorable for Ethereum, with a slight dip of 0.7%, underscoring the ongoing volatility and investor caution. Moreover, Ethereum’s network dynamics also reflect a subdued activity with a marked decrease in ETH burn rate attributed to reduced transaction fees. This technical aspect further complements a cautious Ethereum market narrative, poised on the brink of potentially significant shifts depending on external regulatory actions. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Make-Or-Break Moment: Trading Guru Predicts Rally Amid Market Uncertainty Despite all these, analysts like Ashcrypto suggest that the current volatility could set the stage for a strong rebound in the year’s third quarter.

42390863,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPG7B,1715106895,MoMA’s Madeleine Pierpont: NFTs Are Already Part of Art History,"It’s sometimes easy to overlook exactly how far NFTs have penetrated into the art world, given how thoroughly the general public has rejected the speculation and hype that has come to define the asset class.  Madeleine Pierpont will speak at Consensus 2024 this May in Austin, Texas. Grab your pass here.  But it’s true. Just look at these data points: The world’s biggest auction houses like Sotheby’s and Christie’s still routinely run NFT sales. Legendary arthouse imprint TASCHEN recently published a deep history of the crypto art scene. Art market mainstains like Artnet News and Art Review cover the industry beat. There are NFTs hanging in museums around the world. And every week there’s news of some painter, band or what-have-you that decides to experiment with tokenization. There are those who still say “NFTs aren’t art,” but the art world generally disagrees with them.  Perhaps no one is as familiar with this dynamic than Madeleine Pierpont, the Web3 associate for the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), tasked with the equally enviable and unenviable job of trying to bring in potentially skeptical museum goers into the fold via blockchain programming. While art institutions often have the (deserved) reputation of being elitist, exclusive and outdated, Pierpont argues that NFTs are bringing a renewed verve to the industry and piquing interest in digital art.  “We’re collectively defining this art historical moment as it evolves. It's a challenge because the ecosystem, the NFT space, is so young. There are so many artists that I would hope can be in the museum's collection and be exhibited at some point, but it is such a young ecosystem. Only time will tell,” Pierpont, who will be speaking at the Consensus 2024 conference held May 29 - 31, 2024 in Austin, Texas, told CoinDesk in an interview.  To some extent, NFTs and art are a natural pairing — and not just because a general purpose technology is essentially a blank canvas. But as a medium of exchange, they also help to better connect patrons to creators, and boost transparency in a market known for obscure dealings.  See also: Robert Alice Made NFT History, Now He's Writing About It  CoinDesk caught up with Pierpont to discuss her crypto projects at MoMA (including “Postcards”), what defines the crypto art scene today, and what it was like working with Yoko Ono.  Does “crypto art” as a term make sense?  Compared to NFTs?  Yeah. Is it a cohesive movement?  I think that one of the issues associated with terminology is the gap in knowledge and comprehension within the ecosystem versus outside of it. There is still so much friction in terms of understanding how to even interact with or buy an NFT, let alone navigating one’s own wallet. I know that “NFT” is seen by some now as a bit of a dirty word and people argue in favor of abandoning it for “Crypto Art.”  But I think that if we continue to change terminology, it will only become more confusing and add to onboarding friction. So I feel strongly that we should stick to the term “NFT,” considering that as a term “NFT” has just seen more light. There's more visibility around that term.  To some extent, you're saying to just stay the course because that's the term that initially caught on. But like, comparing like NFTs to inscriptions, which seems to me like a much more descriptive word — analogous to calling a painting a painting because it’s about the method of creation. Whereas, what is a non-fungible token?  Yeah, that's interesting. It raises the question: how do we really define NFTs? Like, what is the defining factor of crypto art or NFTs? But inscriptions, I haven't heard that term before.  See also: As EtherRocks Hit Sotheby's, Who Is Laughing Hardest?  It’s relatively new. They started off on Bitcoin but you can inscribe data on a lot of blockchains. They’re sometimes called ordinals, after the protocol that was created that enabled the actual process of “inscribing” data. But then what results is the inscription.  It depends on the audience. “Inscription” could be confusing within an art historical context, because to inscribe something physically carries different meaning than to inscribe something in code.  Fair point. Guess it’s more of a metaphor.  For me, though, I think it's less about terminology and more about finding more accessible ways to actually just communicate the fundamentals around the technology.  It seems like the art community was willing to accept and embrace NFTs quickly, while the general public almost immediately rejected them due to concerns over energy costs, rampant financialization and speculation. Do you think that given the way they were presented to the world initially that there is now some insurmountable gap that these things have to cross to actually be embraced by the public?  It's tricky. That's a really big and difficult question to answer. And I think it's hard to know what we'll see in the space in the next year, let alone in the next five years.  Yes, there has been a hyper-financialization in the NFT space, but I don’t really see money as a dirty word in this context. NFTs being so transparently connected to the content and art that's being produced is not a negative thing. Transparency around that, from my perspective, is positive on the whole. That said, I think these last two years or so with the market being a bit slower - it has been a useful time enabling people to take a breath and I think we’ve seen a shuffling out of those who perhaps were less committed to ethos of the space and perhaps most focused on the dollar signs.  Was Robert Rauschenberg right to punch Scull?  I'm not familiar with that.  I think it was the 80s, avant-garde artist Robert Rauschenberg punched one of his biggest collectors, because he was angry that he wasn’t profiting if his work was being sold on the secondary market. It’s sort of this infamous moment in art history that symbolized how financialized everything had become by the mid-20th century, because at the end of the altercation Scull pulled Rauschenberg in and said something like “When I make money, you make money” and they ended up hugging.  What's interesting about the NFT space is that collectors are so connected to the artists themselves. Sometimes artists are collectors and vice versa. That patronage relationship is really exciting because it means validation and connection is happening on a person-to-person level. It is extremely democratic in that way, allowing community and relationships to grow organically in concentric circles. It adds an interesting dimension to both the market and the community.  To some extent you are serving the role of validating some artists picking some artists over others at MoMA. Does it stress you out if you’re making the right choices, writing art history in time?  We’re collectively defining this art historical moment as it evolves. It is a challenge because the ecosystem, the NFT space, is still so young. I continue working to build relationships and trying to understand how best to contextualize NFT art and the NFT community in relation to the current and future art historical context.  Could you talk about the inspiration behind Postcards?  One of the initial things that piqued my interest in blockchain was the power that it had to build community in such a global and democratic way. It connects people through their passions, rather than, you know, geographical locations.  With Postcard, we had a number of different goals, but one was to highlight how blockchain can bring people together. We asked people to work together in the creation of these collaborative NFTs, and wanted to create an accessible experience that would hopefully onboard people to blockchain. It was an entirely Web3 experience without a custodial wallet. The aim was to inspire dialogue and richer conversation about what blockchain can do and to build bridges between Web2 and Web3.  It was really a great learning experience for our team as well because I think we better understood the barriers that we face in trying to get people to use technology in general. We learned a lot about what we could be doing to better facilitate those conversations. One of my hopes this year is working to create more opportunities for IRL conversations and events because as much as we are in the digital space, it feels like the most meaningful connections that happen are when people are able to come into a room and converse.  Do you display NFTs at home?  I love Infinite Objects — it’s a beautiful way to display NFTs. I know people also use Samsung frames. I don't think there's really a perfect solution out there that's seamless and easy to use. It’s a bit of a market gap.  See also: Why NFT Artists Shouldn't Expect 'Royalties'  Some NFTs live really well, in my opinion, just on your phone or on your laptop and don't necessarily need an alternate display environment. Others lend themselves spectacularly well to display on a digital screen. I have generally not been in favor of printing digitally native works, making them physical because I have been of the belief that what is natively digital should retain its natively digital value. But I’ve heard some interesting arguments on the contrary…I may be shifting my opinion on that.  I don't think that there is a great NFT artist yet — like a Picasso level. My concern is that the artists aren't weird enough. Is the NFT scene genuinely radical enough?  That's a really interesting question. Thinking back a few years to 2020, it was really cool to watch this space grow so quickly. It was awesome to see artists make a name for themselves by producing things that people were excited about and posting about it on Twitter/X and building an organic community. It seemed like the experimentation was a bit wilder at that time, but again, I think right now is a quieter time. I am certain we will continue to see more artists enter the space. To me, some of the NFT art that is most exciting is when it is leveraging blockchain as a medium…using the infrastructure in the creation of the art itself. Some of this marries blockchain and conceptual art, which reminds me of Fluxus concepts.  Anything you want to add?  Can I just do a quick plug?  Sure.  The SOUND MACHINES exhibition is currently live on Feral File, which features works by seven artists crossing aural and optical domains. Yoko Ono's public SOUND PIECE V is also open for the public to participate in perpetuity. I encourage everyone to view the exhibition and engage!

The strategist has revealed factors that could make Bitcoin’s projected surge to $150,000 difficult, highlighting both macroeconomic trends and Bitcoin’s performance in 2024. Bitcoin Surge To $150,000 Unlikely In a recent interview with Scott Melker, the host of “The Wolf Of All Streets,” podcast, McGlone discussed Bitcoin’s price fundamentals and its possible rise to $150,000 in the 2024 bull cycle. Related Reading: Crypto Whale Spends $10.4 Million On PEPE, Do They Know Something You Don’t? Comparing Bitcoin with the stock market index, the S&P 500, the Bloomberg strategist disclosed that the cryptocurrency was currently showing “divergent weakness,” highlighting that Bitcoin’s performance against the S&P 500 in 2021 was greater compared to 2024. He also revealed that Bitcoin was displaying a similar weak performance to Gold, emphasizing current market conditions and the risk of short-term deflation in the financial market. The combination of these factors pushes McGlone to believe that Bitcoin’s short-term projected rise to $150,000 was unlikely. While the Bloomberg strategist made his foreboding prediction despite Bitcoin’s overperformance at the beginning of the year, McGlone still remains optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s price and fundamental value in the long term. Co-founder and CEO of CoinRoutes, Dave Weisberger, who was also in the podcast with McGlone, made a more optimistic prediction for Bitcoin. Basing his analysis on historical trends and patterns as far back as 2015, Weisberger forecasted that Bitcoin could rise to $200,000 this cycle. His forecast is also acknowledged by reformed hedge fund manager, James Lavish, who revealed in the podcast that Spot Bitcoin ETFs could become a potential driver for Bitcoin’s continuous growth. This is attributed to the massive impact Bitcoin ETFs had on the cryptocurrency’s price following its launch on January 11, 2024. After Spot Bitcoin ETFs were successfully released into the market, the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed to new all-time highs above $73,000. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $63,778, marking a 0.89% increase over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC Crash Presents Perfect Opportunity According to Lavish, if Bitcoin crashes down to the $30,000 to $40,000 range, it would present a “tremendous opportunity” for investors to acquire substantial value in a long-term asset that will essentially hold its value and continue to appreciate in the future.

The settlement, which is still subject to approval by the court overseeing the civil lawsuit, will see the National Football League star known as ""Gronk"" pay into a $2.4 million pool alongside National Basketball Association player Victor Oladipo and racecar driver Landon Cassill, according to a court filing dated May 3.  Gronkowski became a ""brand ambassador, Voyager shareholder"" and holder of Voyager's VGX token in September 2021, a company press release announced at the time.  Voyager filed for bankruptcy in 2022.  A group of Voyager investors sued Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and other Voyager promoters that same year, adding Gronkowski and other promoters last year. The investors announced they had reached a deal with Gronkowski in February. Last week's filing saw the Voyager investors announce that they were ready to proceed with ""the first trance of proposed Class Settlements,"" which were made with Gronkowski, Oladipo and Cassill.  ""Plaintiffs have now settled with Voyager promoters Cassill, Gronkowski, and Oladipo for millions of dollars in relief to the class leaving Co-Defendants Mark Cuban and the Dallas Mavericks as the remaining Defendants for trial in November 2024,"" the filing said.  According to an accompanying exhibit, Gronkowski will pay $1.9 million, Oladipo will pay $500,000 and Cassill will pay $25,000 to settle the claims. If the court approves the settlement, the claims against the three will be dismissed.  Coincidentally, the investors filed the proposed settlement with the court just two days before former NFL quarterback Tom Brady – Gronkowski's former teammate – participated in a comedic roast, which saw several comedians and other stars comment on Brady's previous crypto endorsements, though without mentioning FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried's defunct exchange Brady promoted.  Comedian Kevin Hart joked that the roast was taking place at the Kia Forum and not the Crypto.com Arena to avoid reminding people Brady owed them money, while fellow comedian Nikki Glaser took a more pointed approach.

Legislation from the minority party is unlikely to move the needle in the waning months of the House's crypto negotiations, though its topic is at the center of discussions over illicit finance in the digital assets sector.  Several Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee have a bill coming this week to target money laundering through cryptocurrency mixing services, said Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.), one of its backers.  The legislation will ""clamp down on mixers,"" Casten said of the bill during a hearing Tuesday on U.S. securities enforcement practices, adding that the effort will also be supported by Reps. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.) and Bill Foster (D-Ill.)  ""The presumption should be that these are money laundering channels,"" Casten said, unless sufficient audit work shows otherwise. ""Let's go through and get that cleaned up and fixed.""  Such a bill would arrive as U.S. authorities continue to crack down on mixers, accusing the privacy services of being tools for illicit finance, including in the well-known Tornado Cash case and the more recent pursuit of the developers behind Samourai Wallet. A Democrat bill arriving in the Republican-majority House during this latter stage of the congressional session is unlikely to go anywhere, but it highlights one of the central points around illicit finance at the heart of lawmaker negotiations about future crypto policy.  Read More: Distilling the Tornado Cash and Samourai Suits  Casten also noted Tuesday his concerns about the offshore-issued stablecoin, Tether {{USDT}}, and reports that it's backed ""Russia's war machine"" and been used for funding Hamas.  Despite crypto lobbyists' ongoing insistence that digital assets policy is a bipartisan exercise, the hearing saw Democrats finding fault with the crypto industry while Republican lawmakers criticized the aggressive enforcement posture of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its use of legal actions to try to steer industry behavior.  Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.) was among Republicans who highlighted the recent scandal of SEC lawyers' abuses in the DEBT Box case, and he also noted that the agency is using it's so-called Wells notices – written alerts to a company warning of planned enforcement actions – ""at an astonishing rate, especially when it comes to digital assets.""  Sherman, one of the backers of the pending mixer bill and a very vocal crypto critic, argued that the digital assets industry ""has fought tooth and nail against any meaningful regulation.""

42390860,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPG23,1715102075,What Visa’s ‘Organic’ Stablecoin Report Misses,"What do we talk about when we talk about bots in crypto? Although crypto advocates often think about the suite of these peer-to-peer blockchain-based tools and currencies as advancing human freedom and financial liberty, for years it’s been known that only a small percentage of crypto transactions actually happen between everyday people.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  This was backed up by a recent report co-authored by Visa and data firm Allium Labs into stablecoin use, which found that less than 10% of stablecoin transactions – or just $149 billion the $2.2 trillion total trading volume — in April were “made by real people.” The firms created a new metric measuring “organic payments activity” by filtering out bots and large-scale traders (likely meaning entities like exchanges).  The news certainly seems to poke a hole in the idea that stablecoins are on a rollicking adoption curve, with uptake happening across the globe — particularly in developing economies where users are turning to dollar-backed assets like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC to protect themselves from inflation and onerous capital controls.  Indeed, stablecoins have emerged as one of the clear areas of crypto that seem to have both a clear product-market fit and real-life users. Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, brought in an enviable $4.5 billion in profit in the first financial quarter of the year. This is just part of the reason why everyone and their mother seems to want in the game, from established financial institutions (including Visa!) to blockchain upstarts.  So what’s the story here? Are stablecoins another example of crypto overselling itself — overpromising on the idea of financial revolution and under-delivering — like the many so-called “Zombie Projects” that have recently come into view?  To some extent, even if bots are driving more than 90% of stablecoin volumes, the numbers representing “organic use” remain impressive: around 25 million unique monthly users exchanging almost $150 billion in value in April alone. That may pale in comparison to capital sloshing around on other fintech platforms, but ain’t nothing to sneeze at.  But more importantly, it’s worth asking why exactly Visa is so concerned with bot trading — and what it even considers to be a valid use. According to the report’s methodology, the “inorganic user filter” counted only “transactions that have been sent by an account that has initiated less than 1000 stablecoin transactions and $10m in transfer volume.”  See also: S&P's Stablecoin Report Is a Vote of Confidence for Crypto | Opinion  “Long story short, I think there's significant problems with what Visa is trying to do,” Austin Campbell, adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and former fund manager for Paxos’ BUSD, told CoinDesk in an interview. “Visa is a payments company. They're probably trying to get a measure of crypto that to them looks like peer-to-peer or small merchant payments.”  “This means trying to exclude all of trading, so not just automated trading,” he said. Trading, it shouldn’t have to be said, is a pretty big part of why people use crypto. Additionally, as far as Campbell can tell, Visa’s report cut out wallet addresses for centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, which both hold stablecoins used in services like prepaid cards, “some of which are literally Visas.”  None of this is to suggest that Visa is misrepresenting the data, because, say, as a payments company, Visa’s main business line could be disrupted by stablecoin adoption.

42390854,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPFcP,1715101611,The U.S. Government’s Hypocritical Case Against Tornado Cash,"I’ve been thinking quite a bit about Tornado Cash recently, which is unusual, because I normally spend approximately zero minutes thinking about crypto blenders most days. For reference, Tornado Cash is an Ethereum application that, among other tools, offers the ability to pool assets to allow privacy.  Blockchain transactions are typically public/private transactions. That is, users can shield their identity in transactions by using a coded, unidentified wallet, but all transactions are public and trackable. That is actually the point of blockchain: trackable asset transactions. However, sometimes people don’t want their transactions tracked, for various reasons, some nefarious, others to do with issues like personal safety.  Alexandra Damsker's book, ""Understanding DeFi"" (O'Reilly), was published in February 2024. This op-ed is her personal view.  So privacy services like Tornado Cash exist, bundling assets together by the thousand and allowing individual wallets to shield the origin or lose the tracking of a particular asset. (This doesn’t work for unique assets, like one-of-one NFTs, for example.) It’s just a series of open-source smart contracts on the EVM (Ethereum compatible blockchain) that provides the pooling deposit and withdrawal service. To my knowledge, it does not take a percentage fee of any transaction.  So, this would exist, and no one would really care, except it’s used for money laundering. A LOT of money laundering. Especially by the North Koreans. And, naturally, that brings the attention of the U.S. government. The Treasury Department sanctioned the service in 2022, declaring it a “mixer,” which is illegal. They have arrested one and charged three of the Tornado Cash developers with conspiring to commit money laundering, conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitter and conspiring to violate sanctions law by creating and operating Tornado Cash.  Tornado Cash argues it was a money transmitter business (an unlicensed one), in that it received and transmitted currency, and nothing more. That’s not really a great argument, in general; it doesn’t save them from much.  Here, I think, there is a better argument to be made in that the definition of money transmitter business requires a “party” to be sending and/or receiving currency. If you dig into what that actually means, we’re likely going to end up with a definition like this, from the Code of Federal Regulations: “an individual, a corporation, a partnership, a trust or estate, a joint stock company, an association, a syndicate, joint venture, or other unincorporated organization or group, an Indian Tribe (as that term is defined in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act), and all entities cognizable as legal personalities.”  Without knowing more about the structure of Tornado Cash -- but seeing that the government charged the founders, not an entity – it looks like it was just a series of unowned smart contracts. Smart contracts are unlikely to be recognized in that definition without modifying the definition to include smart contracts and other algorithm-based operators.There was no “party” that could receive or send anything.  Still, the money laundering part -- that sounds bad, right? Creating something that shields illegal activity must be something the federal government hates. Except when it creates it.

It was jointly funded by the Naval Research Lab and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and eventually, in 2006, became Tor, the primary browser of the dark (or unindexed) web. Tor was created and used by the U.S. government for passing along and receiving coded intelligence messages, protecting the identities of agents and dissidents. It relies on the exact same principles as Tornado Cash. It has many users, without discretion as to whether the nature of the user or transaction is legal and exists to shield the privacy of particular users (i.e. for the exact same reasons).  It is well known that a massive amount of illegal transactions occur via Tor, the least of which is money laundering. (I tried to find a reliable statistic on the amount of darknet laundering and fraud, but, being the dark net, the numbers ranged from $1 to $100 billion.) Adversarial nations can access the browser -- both they and the US government count on the traffic and language-jumble to make masking easier. The government not only accepts this; it invites more people to participate. The CIA even gives you convenient access to their Tor portal at https://torproject.org, helpfully suggesting you use a VPN router “to mask your originating internet protocol (IP) address.”  I’m sure the government will rush to sanction itself for these activities, too (just kidding) since it’s illegal to “obfuscate the proceeds from illicit cyber activity and other crimes. . .including sanctions evasion through mixers, peer-to-peer exchangers, darknet markets, and exchanges[, ]. . . facilitation of heists, ransomware schemes, fraud, and other cybercrimes,” according to a 2022 U.S. Treasury press release, and this could equally apply to both Tornado Cash and Tor.  I’ll just wait while they do that. Good thing I brought a book to read.

In a sprawling 26-count criminal indictment unsealed Tuesday morning, prosecutors allege that Khoroshev, 31, developed, promoted and oversaw the LockBit software, recruiting “affiliates” on cybercriminal forums who then carried out the actual ransomware attacks. Once a ransom was paid, typically in bitcoin {{BTC}}, affiliates would give Khoroshev a 20% cut of their earnings, according to the indictment.  Between LockBit’s inception in 2019 and the seizure of most of its infrastructure by a global consortium of law enforcement agencies earlier this year, LockBit became one of the most prolific ransomware tools in the world, with a network of affiliates attacking approximately 2,500 victims – 1,800 of which were in the U.S. – and extorting an estimated $500 million in ransom payments, according to prosecutors.  According to the indictment, Khoroshev received $100 million in bitcoin disbursements from LockBit’s activities over the course of its operation. U.S. authorities are also seeking forfeiture of his ill-gotten gains.  Khoroshev has also been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), barring all U.S. persons – including future victims of a LockBit ransomware attack – from transacting with him. One Bitcoin address was put on the department's ""Specially Designated Nationals"" list alongside Khoroshev, though that address does not appear to have ever held much bitcoin.  Khoroshev remains at large, and, according to a March interview he gave to The Record, continues to operate LockBit.  Five other LockBit members have been charged with crimes for participating in the criminal operation, and at least one – dual Russian-Canadian national Mikhail Vasiliev – has been sentenced to prison.  Khoroshev has been charged with one count of conspiracy to commit fraud, extortion and related activity in connection with computers, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, eight counts of intentional damage to a protected computer, eight counts of extortion in relation to information unlawfully obtained from a protected computer, and eight counts of extortion in relation to intentional damage to a protected computer.

27062985,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606931,1715101217,Bitcoin Local Bottom In? Analyst Offers Insights,"In an ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency markets, deciding the bottom of Bitcoin price correction is an endeavor that attracts interest from both investors and analysts. Joining the fray is cryptocurrency analyst and trader MilkyBull offering insights on the subject, claiming that Bitcoin’s local bottom has developed due to a certain development. Following its weekend recovery out of bear market territory, the price of Bitcoin slightly decreased on Monday. However, MilkyBull is confident that the recent retracement might be the last before BTC turns to move on the upside. Bitcoin Local Bottom Is In According to the expert, given that the next liquidity grab interest is above $64,557, the local bottom for Bitcoin is in. As a result, before moving on to the current all-time high of $73,000, BTC will first clear the $67,000 price level and consolidate. Thus, Bitcoin may eliminate the CME gap below either prior to or subsequent to eliminating the liquidity above $64,975. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom In? Retracement From $73,800 Is Deeper And Took Longer To Form The CME gap is a price difference that occurs between the Friday closing price and Sunday opening prices of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Bitcoin futures market. Therefore, the expert considers this development a good area for long trade, signaling a buying opportunity for BTC bullish investors. MilkyBull further drew attention to a previous analysis that suggests Bitcoin could be poised for a rally due to historical patterns. The analyst noted that the 2017 price action shows that when BTC breached a new all-time high, there was a healthy retracement that was driven by liquidity before it surged to a cycle peak. Given that BTC might be mirroring this pattern, MilkyBull’s analysis might suggest that BTC has undergone its last shakeout, and a move on the upside could be imminent. He also confirmed that the present consolidation range was paralleled by the preceding consolidation, which began to materialize from December 2023 to February 2024. This pattern, identified as a manipulative strategy of the market makers (MMs) by the expert, is meant to remove degenerate Short-Term Holders (STHs), which are particularly vulnerable to price corrections below their cost base. BTC Correction On The Horizon While MilkyBull anticipates a rally, market expert Benjamin Cowen expects the leading cryptocurrency asset to drop in the upcoming days. Last week, Cowen claimed BTC’s Return On Investment (ROI) 12 days after the Bitcoin Halving event was the worst performance that the asset has experienced. According to Cowen, this is reasonable as it is the first time BTC is reaching a new all-time high before the Halving. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Arthur Hayes Says Bitcoin Has Found Its Local Bottom – But Can It Hold This Level? Almost a week later, there is still no improvement, as the analyst noted that BTC ROI is still performing worse than in previous cycles. Comparing this action with that of 2016, Cowen expects BTC to undergo a decline in the coming week. During the time of writing, BTC was trading at $63,970, demonstrating an increase of over 3% in the past week. While its market cap is down by 1.17%, its daily trading volume has garnered positive sentiment, rising by 40%.

Using USDe as collateral could help perpetuals traders to reduce risk, derivatives trader Joshua Lim of Arbelos said.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Ethena's governance token ENA rose sharply Tuesday on the news that crypto exchange Bybit integrated the protocol's USDe ""synthetic dollar"" for various trading activities expanding the token's utility.  Bybit has added USDe as a collateral asset for perpetual futures trading with leverage and also listed spot bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} trading pairs against the token, according to a press release.  ENA hit its highest price in two weeks before retreating somewhat to $0.96, still up more than 8% through the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows. It has outperformed the mostly flat broader crypto market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20).  Bybit's move to accept USDe as collateral asset makes makes Ethena ""even more of a bridge between centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi)"", Joshua Lim, co-founder of derivatives dealer company Arbelos, said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Lim pointed out that the addition helps reduce risk for perpetual traders as USDe carries an embedded short position in itself.  ""[This] is actually a huge deal,"" Lim said.  Ethena has stormed the crypto scene this year, becoming one of the fastest growing DeFi protocol with its tokenized yield-generating investment offering that attracted over $2 billion in deposits, while also drawing plenty of scrutiny of risks from market observers still marred by the crypto implosions of the bear market.

Here’s where these tokens have been heading. PEPE Whales Have Been Active On The Network Today According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, two large PEPE transactions have occurred in the space of a few hours during the past day. Both of these moves are of a scale that’s typically associated to the whales, humongous entities that can carry some influence in the market thanks to their ability to make such large transfers. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Reach Escape Velocity? Analyst Makes The Case Because of their position on the network, their moves can be worth watching, as they may end up reflecting on the price of the cryptocurrency. As for how exactly the asset may be impacted by the transfers of these investors can come down to what they intended to achieve with the moves. It can be hard to say about any exact motive, but the details of the transactions on the blockhain can sometimes provide hints about the context surrounding it. Below are the details of the first PEPE whale transfer from the past day: Looks like this massive transfer on the Ethereum blockchain took a fee of just $1.14 to go through | Source: Whale Alert As is visible, the sending address in the case of this PEPE whale transaction was an unknown wallet, meaning that it was unattached to any known centralized platform like an exchange. Such wallets are usually the investors’ personal, self-custodial addresses. The receiving address, on the other hand, does have a platform affiliated to it: the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Thus, it would appear that the whale moved 1,238,332,920,144 PEPE (worth over $10.5 million at the time the transfer went through) from their personal wallet to the custody of the exchange. Transfers of this type are known as exchange inflows. The investors make exchange inflows whenever they want to make use of one of the services that these platforms provide, which can include selling. As such, exchange inflows can end up being bearish for the price. If the whale, in the current case, indeed made the deposit to sell, then PEPE could naturally be negatively impacted, given the large scale of the transaction. Fortunately for the investors of the meme coin, though, the second transaction from today is actually the exact opposite of this transfer; it’s an exchange outflow. The second large PEPE transaction that took place on the network in the past day | Source: Whale Alert As displayed above, this PEPE whale moved coins from Binance to an unknown wallet through this transaction. Investors generally transfer to personal addresses when they plan to hold in the long term, as it’s safer to do so outside the custody of central entities. Thus, it’s possible this whale plans to HODL these coins. Interestingly, the amount involved in this move, 1,241,850,000,000 PEPE ($10.5 million), is quite similar to the exchange inflow. Given that the same exchange is also involved in both, it’s possible that the same whale may in fact be responsible for the both of them. Related Reading: Bitcoin Relative Open Interest Lowest Since Feb, Analyst Says “Hard To Be Bearish” Though, since the addresses don’t quite match, it’s still uncertain. Either way, the fact that an equal-sized exchange outflow has occurred mere hours after should be able to balance out any bearish effects arising out of the inflow, at least in theory. PEPE Price At the time of writing, PEPE is floating around the $0.000008445479 mark, up more than 21% over the past week.

42390871,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPGbx,1715097600,Suilend to Run Monthslong Points Program With a Twist,"A pseudonymous crypto founder with very public criticisms of DeFi's points trend opened up his own points program on Suilend, one of the fastest growing borrow-and-lending protocols on the Sui blockchain.  Launched Tuesday, Suilend's incentives program addresses some of the most jarring issues that founder Rooter said protocols run into when wooing users with points. Countless protocols ran their own points programs over the past 12 months, almost always as the prelude to a token.  Sui's DeFi landscape grew nearly threefold this year on the back of the resurgent market and boosted by the Sui Foundation's ""Sui Rewards"" incentives programs to attract new users. Protocols including Suilend offered interest rates as high as 19% on stablecoin deposits because of that program.  Points programs pervade Sui DeFi as well as Solana, a rival ecosystem that Rooter and Suilend's team knew well. They previously built Solend, one of Solana's largest borrow-and-lend protocols.  Rooter has previously taken umbrage at some Solana programs' tendency to obfuscate how their points work behind the scenes. ""Points today are predatory, lazy and are really just gambling,"" he wrote in a late March article for Consensus Magazine that was highly critical of ""black box"" tactics.  One notable difference in Sui's points program is its reliance on blockchain tech, Rooter said. In an interview with CoinDesk, Rooter said the points earned by users for, say, depositing USDC will be recorded on the blockchain, where other smart contracts can digest the data.  ""The design space is open for people to build stuff on top of this,"" he said.  Suilend will hand out 10 million points daily in proportional amounts to all users, Rooter said. The more deposits one has, the greater share of the pie they'll get.  At $45 million in total-value-locked, Suilend was the third-largest borrow-and-lend protocol on Sui behind Navi ($121 million) and Scallop ($112 million), according to DefiLlama. Its TVL grew 44% in the past month, far outpacing those lending rivals and all other Sui protocols that DefiLlama tracked.  Suilend's points program will likely continue for ""months,"" Rooter said. He was reluctant to speak in absolutes but stressed it won't run ""forever."" He also declined to say if it would ultimately yield a token – not an unusual stance as founders often balk at openly discussing those points due to regulatory concerns.",POSITIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | SUI | USDC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/05/07/suilend-to-run-monthslong-points-program-with-a-twist,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/891fdb522ef635f3de91d33912b3281119c4182d-4288x2848.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Standard Chartered said a Trump election win could be positive for digital assets.  The bank reiterated its year-end bitcoin price target of $150,000 and $200,00 for the end of 2025.  The risk of U.S. fiscal dominance with the monetization of government debt by the Federal Reserve is growing, and such a scenario should be supportive for cryptocurrencies as investors seek out alternative assets, investment bank Standard Chartered said in a research report on Tuesday.  Donald Trump could also be a boon for cryptocurrencies. “We think that a second Trump administration would be broadly positive via a more supportive regulatory environment,” the report said. “In a scenario of U.S. fiscal dominance, we think bitcoin {{BTC}} would provide a good hedge against de-dollarization and declining confidence in the U.S. Treasury market,” analyst Geoff Kendrick wrote.  U.S. fiscal dominance would likely have three effects on the U.S Treasury curve: “a steeper nominal 2 year/10 year curve, a greater increase in breakevens than real yields, and an increase in term premium” Kendrick said, adding that the bitcoin price has a positive correlation with all three of these potential developments.  If Trump were to win the election a second administration could accelerate the withdrawal of foreign official U.S. Treasury buyers due to fiscal concerns, the bank said, noting that in his first term average annual net selling of U.S. government debt was $207 billion a year versus only $55 billion under Biden’s presidency.  “In addition to the passive boost to BTC from de-dollarization, we would expect a second Trump administration to be actively supportive of BTC (and digital assets more broadly) via looser regulation and the approval of U.S. spot ETFs,” the report added. Standard Chartered reiterated its bitcoin end of year target of $150,000 and $200,000 for year-end 2025.  Read more: Can Crypto Dethrone U.S. Dollar Dominance?

This whale’s story again highlights how conviction in an investment can be very rewarding in the crypto space. How This Ethereum Whale Made $16 Million In A Single Trade On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the whale withdrew 12,906 ETH ($24.39 million) from Binance when the crypto token was still trading at $1,890 a year ago. With Ethereum currently trading at around $3,100, the whale’s ETH investment is now worth over $40 million, signifying a profit of about $16 million. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Crypto Analyst Says Massive Surge Is Coming, Here’s The Target Interestingly, his profits from this trade will likely be more than $16 million, as the trader deposited those tokens in the staking platform Lido when he withdrew them from Binance last year. That means he also earned significant staking rewards to go alongside his $16 million profit. On-chain data shows the whale recently withdrew 7,000 ETH ($21 million) from Lido back to Binance but has yet to offload these tokens. However, that is something to keep an eye on as the whale offloading those tokens could have a negative impact on Ethereum’s price. Tron’s founder, Justin Sun, looks to be another Ethereum whale that could make such significant returns on their ETH investment. Two wallets believed to belong to Sun are reported to have accumulated 295,757 ETH ($891M) at an average price of $3,014 since February 12. Since then, Sun has made some notable moves that could be profitable for him. One such move is that the Tron founder recently deposited 120,000 eETH into Swell L2, a liquid restaking protocol. Although Sun claims that this move isn’t profit-motivated, he could still make huge profits from his venture, considering that restaking is one of the leading narratives at the moment. The Bull Run Presenting A Lot Of Opportunities There have been a lot of reports highlighting how crypto investors and traders have been making life-changing, which suggests that the bull run is already in full force despite Bitcoin’s unimpressive price action lately. One opportunity that these traders have taken advantage of in this market cycle is meme coins. Related Reading: Here’s Why This Crypto Analyst Believes Bitcoin Is At A ‘Prime Buy Zone’ Before the bull run began, there was the belief that memes would be one of the leading narratives, and that has been the case. Bitcoinist recently reported two Solana meme coin traders turned $6,400 into $8 million. Meanwhile, Lookonchain revealed a Solana trader who turned 60 SOL ($8,673) into $1.26 million in 2 months, making a 144x return on his investment.

After a brief ascent earlier this month, the price has dipped back down, leaving investors questioning the strength of the current uptick. While a recent surge in active addresses hints at renewed interest, technical indicators and declining trading volume paint a picture of an uncertain future. Related Reading: 900 Million Telegram Users Send TON Token Soaring 15% – Details Cardano At A Crossroads Cardano’s current price action presents a complex picture. The recent uptick offers a glimmer of hope, but the technical indicators and declining volume suggest a possible continuation of the downtrend. Though its impact is still unknown, the increase in active addresses is a promising indication of possible rekindled interest. It will take time to see if ADA can emerge from the gloomy clouds and start its ascent with greater assurance. Cardano’s Uphill Battle: Price Struggles For Traction For holders of ADA, May started off with a ray of hope. After a rally of three days, the price increased to $0.46 from $0.45. Nevertheless, a series of losses soon erased these gains, returning the price to the $0.45 region, which is where it was previously. This pattern of stops and starts emphasizes how ADA suffers from a lack of consistent propulsion. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.294 trillion. Chart: TradingView As of today, a small uptick has brought ADA back to the $0.45 zone, offering a temporary respite. But lurking beneath the surface is the persistent bear trend, a fact confirmed by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovering just above 40. This metric suggests weak buying pressure and the potential for further price slides. Source: CoinMarketCap Making matters worse, a technical indicator known as a “death cross” looms on the horizon. This ominous pattern occurs when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term average, often signaling a bearish price trend. With ADA currently trading below both these averages, the threat of a death cross adds another layer of uncertainty to the price trajectory. Cardano’s Quiet Streets: Trading Volume Dampens Enthusiasm Trading activity on the Cardano network hasn’t exactly been bustling. The volume, which surged to over $400 million at the beginning of May, has since dwindled to around $275 million. This significant drop suggests a decline in investor interest, which can act as a drag on price increases. Source: Santiment Typically, a healthy increase in volume accompanies sustained price hikes, indicating strong buying and selling activity. In Cardano’s case, the muted volume paints a concerning picture of a market lacking conviction. Related Reading: Whispers In The Deep: Why Are Ethereum Whales Disappearing? Active Addresses Show Tentative Rise A lone bright spot emerges in the form of Cardano’s active addresses. This metric tracks the number of unique addresses participating in transactions on the network. There’s been a recent uptick in seven-day active addresses, with the number rising from around 155,000 to over 160,000. While this increase is encouraging, some analysts believe it might not be substantial enough to significantly impact trading activity and trigger a sustained price reversal.

The shift to an open-ended structure allows for in-kind redemptions, aligns trading price with net asset value, and improves tax efficiency. Inflows have resumed for GBTC, indicating reduced selling pressure and potential price stabilization for Bitcoin as a whole. Investment Thesis In recent months, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), has experienced restructuring, which, I believe, will be very beneficial for investors both in Bitcoin and in GBTC in the long run. In February, GBTC transitioned from a close-ended fund to an open-ended fund. As a close ended fund, GBTC faced larger tax bills, thus forcing their shares to trade at a discounted rate relative to the net asset value (NAV) based on the Bitcoin held. By selling their shares at a discounted rate, investors were not receiving the same level of returns they had come to expect with a Bitcoin investment. When new Bitcoin ETFs were being formed, GBTC acted as the largest source of selling pressure on Bitcoin. When this was occurring, GBTC saw large amounts of outflow, which led to an increase in the amount of Bitcoin being sold on the market, pressuring prices​​. As I mentioned above, in February, GBTC converted to an open-ended fund structure. This transition allowed for in-kind redemptions, meaning investors could now redeem shares directly for Bitcoin rather than selling shares in the secondary market. This structural change was huge for investor benefits, as the discount to NAV was practically eliminated.​ Based on the conversion of GBTC to an open-ended fund, I see GBTC as a strong buy. Not only are shares being sold closer to market price, but inflows have resumed. On top of this, as we have now passed the halving, the surplus of bitcoin has shifted to a deficit. This shift indicates that the selling pressure from GBTC, which had been a major market force, is decreasing​. Background Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) was established in 2013 , offering investors a way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct purchases and secure storage. When first formed, GBTC was a close-ended fund. Because it was a close-ended fund, GBTC did not issue new shares or redeem existing shares, which often led to shares being traded at a discounted price. This discounted price hurt investors, decreasing investor benefits. The need for shares to be sold at a discounted price can be accredited to the difficulty behind adjusting supply and demand dynamics through the creation and redemption of shares. This situation was worsened by the fact that the Bitcoins held by the fund accrued large unrealized capital gains, impacting the fund's tax liabilities and operational strategies. Unrealized capital gains is also known as the increase in value of an investment that has not yet been sold for cash. To GBTC investors, this meant that the value of their investments in the trust were able to increase, despite no transactions actually occurring. The gains received from this were not realized until the Bitcoin had been sold. When these sales finally did occur, the trust was vulnerable to large tax bills, therefore affecting its performance and returns for investors. But, this has all changed, as I mentioned previously that GBTC is no longer a close-ended firm. As an open-ended firm, GBTC is able to provide the direct redemption of shares for Bitcoin at the actual NAV trading price. Because of this, the discounts GBTC experienced prior to this structural shift are no longer occurring . With the disappearance of these discounts, I predict investor returns are going to be much higher and much more reliable. How In-Kind Redemptions Work In-kind redemptions are used by exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to manage the fund's holdings and minimize tax impacts for investors. When investors decide to redeem their shares, instead of receiving a cash payment, they get a basket of securities that the ETF holds. This method does not require the fund to sell its holdings to raise cash, which helps avoid capital gains taxes directly. Since GBTC has converted to an open-ended ETF and gained in-kind redemption capabilities, I predict this will be extremely beneficial for investors. As a close-end fund, GBTC would trade at a discount to the value of the Bitcoin. With the shift to an open-ended structure, this discount has largely been eliminated because shares can now be redeemed directly for Bitcoin. This change enhances liquidity, aligns the trading price closer to the net asset value, and improves tax efficiency by minimizing unnecessary capital gains distributions, therefore more beneficial for investors. It also (and this is key) gives investors a reason not to sell. Before, the tax problems from unrealized gains on Bitcoin meant investors needed to move to other funds in order to get performance that more closely matched spot Bitcoin 1:1. This change in the fund structure fixes that. With this, I think GBTC is one of the best ways to play Bitcoin with a publicly traded fund. Grayscale has been in this business longer than most in terms of custodying Bitcoin, which comes with its own set of unique challenges. That's why I personally trust GBTC (for their experience) and also IBIT (since it's ran by Blackrock- the world's largest ETF manager). Valuation Since the new SEC approved ETFs were launched in January of 2024, investors who wanted to own Bitcoin were presented with new, tax efficient options. As a close ended fund, when buying or redeeming Bitcoin shares, GBTC shareholders were required to do so through the ETF. Considering that GBTC was the largest Bitcoin fund, this had a drastic effect on Bitcoin. Starting in January of this year, Bitcoin has seen $17.5 billion in outflows due to GBTC. What’s key is now that the fund has a new tax efficient structure, things have started to change for BTC; as of May 3rd, inflows have at least temporarily resumed. When evaluating GBTC, it is important to consider other funds within the ETF. In April, I covered IBIT iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), at which point I valued Bitcoin at $148,000 per coin, implying a 2.15x upside potential at the time. Despite this, IBIT has seen the price of the fund's shares fall from $40.35 to $35.40. I stand by my Bitcoin price estimates. In fact, I predict the upside potential will be even higher based on where Bitcoin is now (lower than back in April). Based on my estimated valuation per coin and the current price of BTC, I value upside potential to be around 2.33x current prices. In other words, I believe there is ~133% upside from here. I got these estimates by taking my future price estimate for Bitcoin (still $148,000) and dividing it by the current price (about $63,500 at the time of this writing). Since GBTC is an open-end fund now, it should be able to reciprocate the same 133% upside underlying Bitcoin could have if my price target comes to fruition. Risks As discussed in my previous article on Bitcoin, one of the main risks associated with investing in BTC is the potential for regulatory changes. Regulatory challenges can have negative effects on the value and legality of Bitcoin. Since cryptocurrencies are still relatively new, governments worldwide are still figuring out how to regulate them. Any sudden restrictions or compliance requirements on Bitcoin holders and traders may disrupt the market. As I was writing this, US stock and crypto brokerage Robinhood ( HOOD ) got a Wells Notice from the SEC, meaning they were going to sue Robinhood for permitting the trading of what they believed to be unregistered securities. Adding to regulatory risks, liquidity with Bitcoin is key. While Bitcoin is one of the most popular and widely traded cryptocurrencies, its market is still relatively small compared to traditional financial markets like the global stock market (Global stock market is at $109 Trillion , while Bitcoin is hovering near $1.25 Trillion ). Since the market is a smaller size, large, block transactions made by larger investors have a disproportionate ability to influence Bitcoin's price. This influence on price, I believe, has led to high volatility. Phantom sellers, such as ""dead"" wallets —wallets where the private keys are lost—are another unique Bitcoin risk. These wallets may hold a large quantity of Bitcoin that are perceived to be lost, and therefore the coins can never be sold because they are no longer accessible. This is not guaranteed, and we have seen a notable amount of long dormant Bitcoin wallets come online as a part of this most recent rally. Even with this, I still believe these risks are mitigated. I am not concerned because given the increasing participation from institutional investors in the Bitcoin market, this should net-net over time continue to bring more capital to the space plus provide more liquidity so volatility compresses. These institutions bring in record capital inflows for the launch of an ETF product and also more mature risk management strategies. Conclusion As of February of this year, GBTC transitioned from a close-ended to an open-ended fund, which I believe will greatly increase investor benefits. Now that the fund has the ability to offer in-kind redemptions, the price at which shares trade has become close to the net asset value, causing the biggest reason for GBTC investors to sell to disappear (it's just as good of an ETF as any other Bitcoin ETF). By doing so, the discounts seen in GBTC history are practically erased. Considering GBTC has a large influence within the Bitcoin community, the reduced selling pressure has the ability to stabilize and even increase the price of BTC now that we are post-halving. Despite regulatory risks, which I believe are mitigated, the resumption of inflows after a long bleed sets GBTC up as a promising investment opportunity. I think it’s a buy.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4690088-gbtc-bleed-ending?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/27043170.jpeg

27037461,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606872,1715086809,This Week’s Crypto Watchlist: Top Coins Poised For Gains,"In a post on X, crypto analyst Miles Deutscher laid out his strategic predictions for high-performing cryptocurrencies in the upcoming week to his 501,700 followers. His analysis delved deep into Bitcoin’s trading patterns, the surging AI-driven altcoin sector, and specific tokens that are displaying considerable potential due to recent developments and broader market dynamics. Bitcoin And AI Crypto Tokens Are Set To Dominate This Week At the forefront of Deutscher’s analysis, Bitcoin has recently returned to its previous trading range between $60,000 and $69,400 after experiencing a sharp drop. This movement was characterized as a significant deviation, suggesting manipulation or a shakeout of weak hands before a potential rally. “Bitcoin is at the top of my watchlist for this week. Had a big fakeout/deviation to the downside, and now back within the range,” Deutscher stated. He pointed out that the key factor to watch is whether the current range’s lower boundary will hold, which could serve as a strong foundation for an upward trajectory. Moreover, the AI sector has been particularly resilient and robust recently, bouncing back significantly amidst broader market recoveries. Deutscher highlighted the sector’s potential for outperformance, driven by several upcoming major events. These include Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), NVIDIA’s earnings announcement, and the anticipated release of ChatGPT 5. “AI is one of those unique narratives that retains constant mindshare due to its endless real-life news flow/hype,” Deutscher explained. Related Reading: Here’s Why This Crypto Analyst Believes Bitcoin Is At A ‘Prime Buy Zone’ One specific AI token which Deutscher watches closely due to its alleged partnership with Apple is Render (RNDR), making it a prime candidate for speculation around the upcoming Apple event. Historically, RNDR has also led the AI token sector during market rotations. Furthermore, Deutsches focuses on Near Protocol (NEAR), Fetch.ai (FET), AIOZ Network (AIOZ). He grouped these tokens together due to their correlation but noted their recent technical performance, where they bounced cleanly off daily support levels and established higher lows. More Altcoins To Watch TON: Recently the center of attention, TON experienced a drop after the Token2049 event in what Deutscher described as a “sell-the-news” scenario. However, recent investments by firms like Pantera signal continued interest and potential undercurrents of growth. Ethena (ENA): With the market sentiment turning bullish again, Deutscher anticipates a return to positive funding rates, which typically benefit tokens like Ethena. Recent activity from the Ethena team, including increased reward boosts and optimistic social media posts from its founders, further bolster the bullish case. “Also hearing rumors of a T1 exchange listing,” Deutscher added, suggesting an impending increase in liquidity and exposure. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Reveals 6 Must-Buy Altcoins With The Most Potential Jito (JTO): Jito is reportedly developing what Deutscher referred to as the “Eigen Layer of Solana,” aiming to replicate the success and hype surrounding the Eigen project’s layer solutions. Despite the challenges of a recent airdrop, Deutscher sees potential if the team executes well, particularly as the restaking narrative has not yet fully penetrated the market. PopCat (POPCAT): Despite facing some fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) related to copyright issues over the weekend, POPCAT continues to exhibit strong price action, pushing toward new highs. “POPCAT seems the best contender, for now, not a single cat meme coin has yet to hit a $1B market cap,” noted Deutscher, highlighting its standout performance. Ethereum Finance (ETHFI): In the realm of liquidity reward tokens (LRT), ETHFI remains a notable mention despite a broader sector sell-off post-Eigen. Deutscher believes the selling may have been overreactive, and with total value locked (TVL) still on the rise, a reversion to mean on prices could be imminent. SEI Network (SEI): As anticipation builds for the launch of the new layer one blockchain, Monad, later this year, SEI is seen as a strategic play. Categorized within the parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) narrative, SEI experienced a substantial sell-off but is poised for recovery as the market focus shifts towards upcoming launches. Friend (FRIEND): After recommending FRIEND at $1.30, Deutscher continues to see upside potential, particularly as it approaches more significant centralized exchange listings. He advises keeping an eye out for major pullbacks as opportunities to buy.

42390872,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPGmD,1715083279,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Settles Into $63K-$64K Range,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin fluctuated between $63,000-$64,000 during the Asian and European mornings on Tuesday, consolidating its recovery from last week's crash below $57,000. Despite retreating from Monday's high of around $65,500, BTC appears to have settled into a range comfortably above the $60,000 level. At the time of writing, it was priced at $64,114, largely unchanged from its price 24 hours before, but nonetheless up around 10% since the start of May following a slide of over 16% in April. The broader digital asset market has dropped 1.33% since yesterday, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20).  Robinhood would probably win a court case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to broker KBW. The SEC's issuing of a Wells Notice against the trading platform is surprising given its conservative approach to digital asset listings, KBW said in a research report on Monday. “Our preliminary view is that HOOD would likely fight the SEC in court and has a higher likelihood to prevail than most U.S. competitors (if put in similar situations) given HOOD’s stricter listings standards,” the authors wrote. KBW added that HOOD shareholders won't have full clarity on the outcome of any legal case until late 2025, based on the timescales of the SEC's ongoing suit with Coinbase.  Digital bank Revolut's new crypto exchange is now available to professional cryptocurrency traders. Revolut X is designed to entice users to trade through it rather than buying and selling with the Revolut app by offering lower fees. Revolut will charge zero fees to the maker of a trade and 0.09% to the taker. Revolut has allowed the buying and selling of crypto within its app for several years and has now launched its own exchange to compete with other leading participants. The London-based company, which has more than 40 million customers worldwide, is among the first banks to build a standalone crypto exchange.

27030157,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606884,1715083233,Why Is The Bitcoin Price Falling Today?,"Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a price slowdown, having recently recovered above $60,000. This tepid price movement is believed to be due to a couple of factors, including the reduced demand for the Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Have Lost Their Spark The Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded billions of dollars in net inflows in the first three months of launch. This contributed to the significant rally that Bitcoin recorded right around when the funds were approved, with the flagship crypto rising to a new all-time high (ATH) in March. However, demand for these funds has declined since the start of this month. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Cardano Bloodbath Far From Over, Sets Bottom Price For ADA Research firm Kaiko also noted in its recent report that net inflows across all ETFs have steadily dropped for a while now. This has ultimately affected Bitcoin’s bullish momentum, with the flagship crypto trading sideways. Bitcoin’s price performance in the last 24 hours suggests that the recovery above $60,000 wasn’t necessarily a bullish reversal. Andrey Stoychev, Head of Prime Brokerage at Nexo, had previously warned that Bitcoin was unlikely to experience any significant price surge without a catalyst. He added that the crypto token would likely continue to trade around the $67,000 price range. That means one can expect Bitcoin to keep bouncing off the support and resistance in the meantime. The silver lining is that the demand in the Spot Bitcoin ETFs could pick up soon enough, with these funds likely to provide a much-needed boost to Bitcoin’s price when that happens. A trend reversal for these ETFs looks imminent, especially after Grayscale’s GBTC recorded its first day of net inflows on May 3. Another Reason Why Bitcoin’s Price Is Down Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also recently predicted that Bitcoin could drop below to clear the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) gap at around $62,580. This price gap exists because the CME’s Bitcoin futures market doesn’t run on weekends. The crypto analyst added that things could pick up once Bitcoin clears the CME gap. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Crypto Analyst Says Massive Surge Is Coming, Here’s The Target The analyst also suggested that the worst may be behind, irrespective of whether Bitcoin continues to trade sideways, as he stated that the crypto token’s local bottom is in. However, Mikybull Crypto also predicts that Bitcoin will need to clear out the $67,000 price level and consolidate before it can move towards $73,000. In anticipation of this price surge, now looks to be an excellent time to accumulate the flagship crypto as crypto analyst Ali Martinez mentioned that Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) 90-day ratio indicates that it is still in a “prime buy zone.” At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $63,400, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

I have shifted focus to Bitcoin as their primary swing trade asset in the crypto space. The ETHBTC pair suggests that upward momentum currently favors Bitcoin, leading the author to increase their Bitcoin allocation and flatten their Ether position. The bull market in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rages on, and I have no reason to move away from my target of $125K. Bitcoin also held the more aggressive bullish support level of $36K discussed in the article I wrote in January after spot ETFs began trading on US exchanges. This more bullish count, which I called the red count in the article, showed the next target as $66K, which was also an attack on the previous all-time highs made in 2021. That level was struck in early March, but Bitcoin stretched a bit further to $73K before starting the flat correction it is now working through. I expect this correction to hold $50,600, and if it does, Bitcoin should reach $88K before the next bout of sideways movement. Current Bitcoin 1D Chart (Created by the author with Motivewave Software) While Bitcoin is looking good, Ether (ETH-USD) has softened quite a bit in its performance against Bitcoin. While I have not turned bearish on Ether on a USD basis, I find using it as a primary swing trade vehicle uninspiring when Bitcoin solidly outperforms. I traded Bitcoin and other cryptos actively for the last three halving cycles. In the first, from 2016 to the 2017 top, my main holding was Ethereum, simply because I had a better handle on the chart. But for reasons that would take another article to explain, Bitcoin became my primary long-term asset in the crypto space. Despite my using Bitcoin as a core holding, Ethereum has often been a better swing trade asset. It displays a high correlation to Bitcoin, yet often outperforms Bitcoin during brief slices of a cycle. I wrote an article in August of 2023 that suggested one of those periods of Ether outperformance would soon start. Had that setup held, we would have entered a phase in which Ether outperformed Bitcoin. Yet it failed, as did one more such setup after that article was published Fortunately, if you held some Ether (as I have since I wrote that article), you fared well. It has nearly doubled in price since that article appeared. However, as we are in the latter stages of this bull market and it is showing no further inclination to outperform, I have soured on Ether as the better swing trade vehicle. And I have my doubts that it will gain another chance to outperform, based on the current microstructure of the ETHBTC pair. The current action in the ETHBTC pair shows a small chance of a local reversal off 0.046, sending it to 0.06. That isn’t a sufficient move to favor Ether, and the local reversal is fraught and looking corrective. It appears more likely to drop to 0.041 in red-v. We can watch for another attempt at that level. ETHBTC (Created by the author with Motivewave Software) It Gets Worse As if that wasn’t enough, the USD chart for Ether has hit a speed bump. Its low on April 8 broke what I considered impulsive support in its third wave, which started with a confirmed breakout on November 23. Breaking impulsive support doesn’t mean that I must discount the $10,500 Ether target that I have long held. However, it does suggest the path to that target may be slow, while Bitcoin is on a more direct path to its target. I am now watching Ether’s 2023–24 structure as an ending diagonal, now in C of its third. This puts the microstructure in wave 1 of that C, provided it holds $2480. This 1-2 setup gives me a target of $7300 for circle-3 of wave-3. That’s a nice healthy double from here if the setup works. Ether’s structure becomes quite murky below $2480. My favored view is that the structure from the 2021 top until now would turn into a long three-year triangle before its final push to $10,500. That is illustrated in time. ETHUSD 1D Chart (Created by the author with Motivewave Software) A Question of Momentum Astute readers will have some basic questions at this point: ‘Why are you more bullish on Bitcoin when your Ether targets suggest a higher return?’ And, ‘Why are you shifting your view amid a potential micro setup that can double the price of Ether, while Bitcoin may tack on 50%?’ In reply, I say that a comparison of the two coins’ targets in USD is not enough to answer the question of which chart outperforms. The targets suggest where the USD charts should go, but not how fast. The ETHBTC pair seeks to address the question of timing. As long as the pair is locked in a downtrend, upward momentum favors Bitcoin. I will change my view and get back to aggressively trading Ether once the ETHBTC pair sets up better. One way in which this puzzle may find a solution is that Ether peaks later than Bitcoin. When Bitcoin topped in late December 2017, Ether took almost another two weeks to top, in January 2018. Ether also rallied one further month after Bitcoin’s April 2021 high. We may see something similar in this cycle, with Bitcoin topping at $125K, and Ether taking another week or month to reach $10,500. Getting out of Bitcoin and taking the last push in Ether is a dangerous affair, in my experience. Once Bitcoin lays in major tops, the crypto market slowly transitions into deflation. And crypto bear markets are uniquely brutal. Bitcoin usually loses 60% or more, and many altcoins never again see their cyclical all-time highs as they fade into history. BTC and ETH's Peaks in 2017 and 2021 (Created by Author with Tradingview) Conclusion In summary, after being patient with the incessant downtrend, and multiple setup failures in the ETHBTC pair, I am slowly flattening my Ether position, in favor of increasing my Bitcoin allocation. This was not a rash decision. Honestly, I see myself as having given Ether a lot of grace. I have held a swing position in Ether through all the setup failures in ETHBTC. Of course, I did not hold it to my financial detriment. The return in Ether over 2023–24 may make many stock swing traders envious. There is always a chance that I was so late to decide to flatten my Ether position that finally it turns. However, I must trade what I see, and as it stands today, I see no reliable reversal in the ETHBTC pair. Further, I can move back to Ether quickly if the edge changes.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4690041-ethereum-cant-seem-to-catch-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/27030108.jpeg

42390869,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPGWp,1715083200,"Poll: Most People Cringe About Crypto, But Enough Care to Warrant Politicians' Attention","While one in five consider crypto a significant factor in their political thinking, only about 62% of those are supportive of digital assets, suggesting there may be animosity among the remainder of people who are most engaged on crypto issues.  About 14% of those surveyed have crypto, and another 7% are interested in investing.  As U.S. politicians continue to wrestle with how to approach crypto issues, about 21% of voters in vital swing states consider cryptocurrency policies as a topic important enough to sway their support, according to a Harris Poll survey commissioned by the industry, though it leaves some uncertainty about what the voters may end up clamoring for.  While millions of crypto industry dollars are pouring into campaigns and top candidates try out stances on digital assets, the voters who care the most may not be on the same side of the issue. The challenge for the industry could be in figuring out whether the high level of interest is going to help its cause.  “This data shows crypto is top of mind for voters in swing Senate states and that a pro-crypto position is a net positive for policymakers and candidates,” concluded Julie Stitzel, senior vice president of policy at Digital Currency Group, which commissioned the polling and sees its results as positive.  About 14% of people in the online survey of registered voters own crypto right now, they said, and many more have a high awareness of the emerging financial technology. But fewer than one in three voters surveyed – 31% – said they have positive views on digital assets, according to the snapshot of responses from people in Michigan, Ohio, Montana, Pennsylvania and Arizona.  Those in the crypto-positive group who say they'll weigh crypto positions in their voting decisions represent about 13% of respondents. That leaves 8% who may not be as enthusiastic about policies friendly to digital assets – a split that may leave this year's candidates uncertain about which way to lean, despite industry hopes.  Though most of the swing-state voters — on whose shoulders the presidential selection and the congressional majorities could rest – may distrust crypto, even more of them think the current financial system is outdated (70%) and needs to be overhauled (74%). A significant 41% of them also granted that crypto may represent a path to financial security (41%).  More than two thirds of the respondents don't think federal officials – including the president and Congress – are up to the task of making good policy decisions on crypto.  Whatever side the voters land on, Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, noted in a statement that the poll demonstrates ""digital assets have emerged as a significant issue in the upcoming election.""  The data suggests that as many as 47 million people may be holding digital assets, if 14% of the wider U.S. population also own crypto, which is a lot of voters to contend with. The survey indicates they represent a fairly close balance between the two political parties, favoring the conservative side a bit. The survey, though, suggested that pro-crypto voters may be slightly less inclined than others to show up to vote.  In another noteworthy finding, the survey results may also hint that the industry shouldn't count on a massive segment of the public waiting on the sidelines to invest in cryptocurrencies, with only 7% of those who don't own any saying they still intend to jump in. However, about half of the people said they'd be more interested if established, big-name financial firms were involved and also if the government puts protections in place.

Participants included Ethereum Name Services (ENS) and Rarestone Capital.  As it gears up for its token launch, Galaxis, a Singapore-based Web3 platform, has raised $10 million from funders including Ethereum Name Services (ENS), Rarestone Capital, Taisu Ventures and ENS co-founder Nick Johnson, it announced Tuesday.  Gains made through the company's node sale of more than 11,000 'Galaxis Engines' also contributed to the total funding.  The platform, which helps creators and brands introduce collections of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), has worked with celebrities including DJ Steve Aoki, actor Val Kilmer and NBA personality LaMelo Ball. It has sold more than 225,000 NFTs over the last couple of years, generating over 32,000 ETH ($100 million) in secondary sales of NFTs and is now preparing for ""mass distribution,"" the company said.  Chainlink was a seed investor in the company.

While celebrating its first anniversary on May 3rd, 2034, the network finds itself embroiled in a controversy surrounding its tokenomics, the design and distribution of its cryptocurrency, SUI. Related Reading: Is Avalanche About To Blow? Don’t Miss This Potential Breakout – Analyst SUI Supply: Cause for Concern? The fire was ignited by Justin Bons, founder of Cyber Capital, who tweeted concerns about the SUI token supply being overly concentrated in the hands of the founders and early contributors. Bons pointed to a potential 80% allocation – 160 million out of a total 10 billion – going to Mysten Labs, Sui’s creator, and another 600 million earmarked for “early contributors,” raising eyebrows about potential centralization. 1/16) SUI has a great design, except for its token economics: SUI claims to have a capped supply of 10B, with 52% being “unallocated” till 2030 The problem is that over 8B SUI is being staked right now! Over 84% of the staked supply is held by founders! SUI is centralized: 🧵 — Justin Bons (@Justin_Bons) May 2, 2024 This alleged lack of decentralization worries investors. If these significant token holders decide to sell their SUI holdings (dump), it could cause a dramatic price drop, harming regular investors. Sui Fights Back: Transparency On The Agenda The network wasted no time in refuting these claims. The network vehemently denied any accusations of a centralized token supply, calling them “misleading” and “inaccurate.” In a bid to assure investors, Sui emphasized that Mysten Labs doesn’t have control over the Sui Foundation treasury, community reserves, or investor tokens. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView The network further clarified that the foundation, as the largest holder of locked tokens, will release them according to a publicly available schedule. They reiterated their commitment to transparency, stating that “every token that will be released has been allocated.” Additionally, Sui highlighted that all staking rewards earned by the foundation are reinvested back into the community, a detail also reflected in the public emission schedule. SUI 24-hour price action. Source: Coingecko Trust Issues: The Market Responds While Sui attempts to quell concerns, some market participants remain skeptical. They question the network’s motives, labeling the token distribution strategy as potentially manipulative. This skepticism coincides with a recent slump in SUI’s price. Related Reading: Whispers In The Deep: Why Are Ethereum Whales Disappearing? Despite impressive gains in the past, the token has shed over 25% in the last month and sits a staggering 90% below its all-time high.

The Importance Of Transparency: A Lesson For Blockchain Projects The SUI tokenomics controversy underscores a critical lesson for the entire blockchain industry: transparency is paramount for building investor trust. Justin Bons’ concerns, though potentially exaggerated, highlight the need for clear communication and verifiable token distribution plans. As the blockchain space matures, projects that prioritize transparency and fair distribution models will likely garner stronger investor confidence and ultimately, a more sustainable future.

42390901,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPQNB,1715078261,AI Tokens Lead Crypto-Market Recovery as Nvidia Hits One-Month High,"AI tokens such as RNDR, AGIX, FET outshine bitcoin by a wide margin.  NVDA rallies to a one-month high as excitement builds around the chipmaker's impending earnings report.  Native cryptocurrencies of blockchain projects supposedly using artificial intelligence (AI) have led the crypto market recovery in recent days, while shares of Nasdaq-listed chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), the poster child for all things AI, also rallied.  RNDR, the utility token of decentralized GPU-based rendering solutions, The Render Network, has surged almost 40% to $10.432 in seven days, the biggest gain among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market value, according to data source CoinGecko.  Other AI coins, such as SingularityNET's AGIX, Bittensor's TAO and Fetch.ai's FET, have gained between 17% and 23%, outperforming the broader market. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, has risen 1.7%, while the CoinDesk 20 Index, a broader market gauge, has rallied 0.6%.  Crypto analytics platform DYOR's relative strength crypto narrative tracker shows decentralized AI coins and DePIN – or decentralized physical infrastructure – tokens are among the best performers of the past seven days.  ""There is a strong buzz around Nvidia's impending earnings,"" Hitesh Malviya, founder of DYOR, told CoinDesk. ""AI coins will keep having cyclical runs [higher] as they are directly correlated with the whole AI-side development happening around us.""  The chipmaker is set to report first-quarter earnings on May 22 after the market close. Zacks Investment Research expects the company to report earnings per share of $5.49, a 403% year-on-year increase. Recent results from other AI companies have been largely positive, according to Bloomberg.  Shares in NVDA rose to $922 on Monday, hitting the highest since April 1. They have recovered more than 20% from the low of $756 reached on April 19, according to data source TradingView.  Over the years, bitcoin and the broader crypto market have developed a strong positive correlation with NVDA, whose chips were used to power mining rigs before garnering interest from AI. NVDA and the crypto market bottomed out in late 2022, ending an almost year-long downtrend with the debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which helped raise general awareness about artificial intelligence.  Speculation is rife that OpenAI is likely to launch version 5 of ChatGPT in the coming months. Late last month, technology giants reported a better-than-expected quarterly earnings growth powered by substantial investments in artificial intelligence.  Notably, during Apple’s recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook talked about the company’s continued investments in generative AI and teased major AI-related announcements at ""Let Loose event"" on May 7 and the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10.  ""OpenAI will launch a new model in the coming months, better hardware will be developed, and more funds will be injected into the space. We are in an AI super cycle right now,"" Malviya said.

The broker expects no change to the platform’s current U.S. crypto operations or asset listings.  Robinhood has a higher likelihood of winning a case with the SEC than most of its U.S. competitors, the report said.  Robinhood (HOOD) being issued a Wells Notice by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is surprising given the company’s very conservative approach to digital asset listings, KBW said in a research report on Monday.  KBW notes that Robinhood only offers fifteen cryptocurrencies on its U.S. platform, while some of its peers offer more than two hundred digital assets.  “We expect no change to HOOD’s current U.S. crypto operations or asset listings - and expect the SEC to bring forward a suit within the coming months,” analysts led by Kyle Voigt wrote.  “Our preliminary view is that HOOD would likely fight the SEC in court and has a higher likelihood to prevail than most U.S. competitors (if put in similar situations) given HOOD’s stricter listings standards,” the authors wrote.  Crypto trading makes up 12% of Robinhood’s revenue, the report said, and KBW assumes that the SEC will likely go after a subset of digital assets on the platform.  “The worst case scenario from a revenue-at-risk perspective is if the SEC chooses to move forward with categorizing ether {{ETH}} as a security - as this likely makes up ~25% of HOOD’s crypto assets/trading,” the report added.  The broker has a market perform on the stock with a $20 price target. The shares were trading 1.3% higher in early trading on Tuesday at around $18.  KBW said that Robinhood shareholders won’t have full clarity on the outcome of a potential legal case until late 2025 at the earliest, citing the regulator’s ongoing case against crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN).

Investors are on tenterhooks, with whales exiting their positions and the market sentiment teetering between fear and a glimmer of hope. Related Reading: 900 Million Telegram Users Send TON Token Soaring 15% – Details Ethereum Price Struggles To Regain Footing Ethereum’s price has been on a rollercoaster ride in recent months. After reaching new highs in late 2021, the cryptocurrency plunged dramatically, leaving investors reeling. The recovery has been slow, with Ethereum currently hovering around $3,077 – a far cry from its peak. Source: Coingecko This lackluster performance is causing anxiety among investors, particularly large holders known as whales. Recent data from Lookonchain paints a concerning picture: a whale who bought ETH a year ago is cashing out, pocketing a cool $16 million in profit. This whale’s actions highlight a potential exodus of major investors, which could further depress the price. Fear Grips Ethereum Whales WhaleStats, a platform that tracks large cryptocurrency holders, reveals that Ethereum whales are experiencing extreme fear. The BSC Chain Ethereum Whales’ Fear and Greed Index, a measure of investor sentiment, is currently in the “extreme fear” zone. This suggests that whales are hesitant to make any significant moves, waiting for the market to stabilize before deploying their capital. Source: WhaleStats While Ethereum remains the most popular token among whales, their apprehension is palpable. They are closely monitoring market movements, waiting for a clear signal before taking the plunge. Divided Opinions On Ether’s Future The future of Ethereum remains a subject of debate among crypto analysts. Ashcrypto, a prominent analyst, believes in a potential rebound in the third quarter of this year. Based on historical patterns from 2020 and 2021, Ashcrypto predicts a price surge towards $4,000. ETHEREUM PRICE UPDATE – Similar fractal as of Q4 of 2020 – Breakout could happen in Q3 of 2024 as per historical pattern Once it breaks out, the 100x altseason will begin with ETH leading its way towards $15,000. pic.twitter.com/F1Zr6mQeHB — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) May 6, 2024 Data from IntoTheBlock reveals a strong correlation between Ethereum’s price and large transaction volume. The recent drop in large transactions coincides with the price decline, suggesting that whales play a critical role in influencing Ethereum’s trajectory. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.28 trillion. Chart: TradingView ETH Price Action At A Glance Meanwhile, with its next target of $3,090, Ether is expected to continue its correcting bearish trend, demonstrating further bearish bias when it settles below $3,120 once more. If the price breaks $3,100, it will halt the projected slide and try to reclaim the main positive trend. A move below the EMA50 would support the continuation of the recommended negative wave.

Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla were detained after flying to the country for talks on regulatory supervision.  The detention after being invited for talks sets "" a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide,"" Teng wrote.  Binance CEO Richard Teng called on the Nigerian government to release Tigran Gambaryan, head of the crypto exchange's Financial Crime Compliance team, who flew to the country in February for talks on regulatory supervision.  ""As you may be aware, one of our beloved colleagues, Tigran Gambaryan, continues to be held by the government in Nigeria for more than 70 days,"" Teng wrote in a blog post. ""I also feel that it's time to speak out about this issue on behalf of the global business community. To invite a company's mid-level employees for collaborative policy meetings, only to detain them, has set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide.""  The government of Africa's most populous nation is struggling with an economic crisis that sent its currency to a record low against the dollar in March while inflation climbed to a 28-year high of 33.2%. In February, Bank of Nigeria Governor Olayemi Cardoso said Binance had allowed $26 billion of funds to leave the country untraceably last year, hitting tax revenues. Binance has been trying to contact the country's Securities and Exchange Commission since 2022 to clarify the licensing requirements, though it hasn't received responses to its approaches, Teng wrote.  Gambaryan and the exchange's regional manager for Africa, Nadeem Anjarwalla, were detained in February after flying in for a meeting that included the CEO of the SEC, the deputy governor of the central bank and the national security adviser, according to Teng.  The executives were originally held in a secure compound, according to Teng. Anjarwalla made headlines in March after escaping custody. Gambaryan, who is now being held on money laundering charges, is in the Kuje prison – which also houses suspected members of the Boko Haram terrorist group – after an Abuja court postponed a bail hearing until May 17. The two have filed a lawsuit against the Nigerian authorities for violating their human rights.  A $150 million bribe: NYT  The New York Times reported that during a visit in January, Gambaryan has been asked by ""someone in the Nigerian government"" for a bribe amounting to roughly $150 million in crypto, citing five people familiar with the matter and messages it reviewed.  In his blog post, Teng referred to the request from ""unknown persons,"" without mentioning an amount. Gambaryan alerted contacts in the Nigerian government and wrote a three-page report describing the payment request, which he gave to Binance’s lawyers, the NYT said.  ""Our team grew increasingly concerned about their safety in Nigeria and immediately departed,"" Teng wrote. ""We, of course, declined the payment demand via our counsel, not viewing it to be a legitimate settlement offer ...""  Nigerian government authorities did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment on the report. Gambaryan's family said they had nothing further to share.  Nigeria vows to ban P2P crypto trading in naira  In Nigeria's latest step against cryptocurrency ever since it accused Binance of manipulating the local exchange rate, tax evasion and money laundering, the nation has now vowed to ban person-to-person cryptocurrency trading in the naira, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.  The decision was announced by Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission Director General Emomotimi Agama at a meeting with fintech professionals on Monday, the report said.  “The thing that needs to be done is delisting the naira from the P2P space in order to avoid the level of manipulation that is currently happening,” Agama said. “Recent concerns regarding crypto P2P traders and their perceived impact on the exchange rate of the naira has underscored the need for collective action.""  Additionally, Agama said that new rules would be rolled out “in the coming days” covering crypto exchanges, digital asset custodians and other corners of the sector, the report said.  In the blog post, Teng said Gambaryan and Anjarwalla were detained on Feb. 26, and ""the next 24 hours were marked by aggressive behavior towards"" them.  On Feb. 28, ""we removed the naira pairing from our site and shut down the P2P product for Nigeria on the Binance platform,"" requesting immediate “safe passage to the airport"" for the executives, Teng wrote.

27009978,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606832,1715068844,The Next Big Catalyst For Bitcoin? What Michael Saylor Predicts,"In an interview with journalist Natalie Brunell, Michael Saylor, executive chairman and co-founder of MicroStrategy, laid out his vision for what could next propel the price of Bitcoin. His insights come at a time when the digital currency landscape is experiencing pivotal regulatory and institutional developments. The Next Big Catalyst For Bitcoin Price Saylor pinpointed the specific moment he believes heralded the onset of a new era for Bitcoin. “January of 2024 marked the beginning of the period of corporate adoption of Bitcoin,” he stated. The significance of this shift, according to Saylor, is tied closely to regulatory approvals and the distinctive path Bitcoin is carving for itself amidst a sea of digital assets. The crux of Saylor’s argument is the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision-making process regarding cryptocurrency spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). He described the SEC’s approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs as the “first big catalyst.” This regulatory nod not only legitimizes Bitcoin in the eyes of institutional investors but also enhances its appeal as a viable corporate treasury asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Relative Open Interest Lowest Since Feb, Analyst Says “Hard To Be Bearish” Now, Saylor argues that the next decisive moment will hinge on the SEC’s handling of other cryptocurrencies. “The second big catalyst will be the SEC’s denial of every other crypto application for spot ETFs,” Saylor explained. By denying these applications, the SEC would effectively position Bitcoin as the premier, unreplicated choice among cryptocurrencies, an outcome Saylor sees as critical for dispelling doubts about Bitcoin’s long-term viability and uniqueness. “And when we actually see the regulators deny the applications of the copies of other crypto assets, then we will have checked the box. It won’t be banned, it won’t be copied,” Saylor remarked. Expanding on the implications of such regulatory decisions, Saylor employed a metaphor involving the choice of materials in large-scale engineering projects. He compared the decision-making process in corporate investment in Bitcoin to choosing between steel or bronze for constructing a skyscraper. Related Reading: Here’s When Bitcoin Could Peak In This Accelerated Bull Run: Analyst “Once you realize there’s just steel and there is no second best metal for structural civil engineering, the project moves forward,” he noted. In this analogy, Bitcoin is likened to steel — the foundational material without substitute — clearing any hesitation about its adoption in corporate portfolios. Should we be watching for another catalyst that will spur more #Bitcoin adoption? ""The first big catalyst was the SEC's approval of spot #ETFs for Bitcoin…the second big catalyst is going to be the SEC's denial of every other #crypto application for a spot ETF…"" –@saylor… pic.twitter.com/4aKarg6eAS — Natalie Brunell ⚡️ (@natbrunell) May 6, 2024 Notably, this narrative is timely as the crypto sector watches the SEC closely, particularly with regard to Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The final deadline for the SEC to approve or deny the VanEck spot Ethereum ETF is May 23, 2024, a decision that has been postponed repeatedly. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, noted a decrease in the likelihood of approval in March, citing a lack of communication between the SEC and ETF applicants, which he viewed as a negative signal for Ethereum’s immediate ETF prospects. At press time, BTC traded at $63,835.

The high expense ratio will likely lead to underperformance compared to other ETFs or Bitcoin itself. GBTC's justification for its high fees is unconvincing, and there are better alternatives available. However, if Grayscale were to lower its fees to align with its competitors, the ETF could. My recommendation is to hold GBTC for a few more months if you already have it in your portfolio, to see if Grayscale will reduce its fees. Otherwise, it's best to avoid this ETF. In one of my previous articles , I discussed the top Bitcoin ETFs for investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin, excluding the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) due to its high management fees. Today, I'll go into detail about GBTC and explain why I believe it's an inefficient option for Bitcoin exposure. Thesis: GBTC's high expense ratio is unreasonable and will likely hinder the ETF's performance The GBTC ETF has an expense ratio of 1.50%. This is more than five times the 0.20% - 0.25% that Bitcoin ETFs such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) are charging. After examining Grayscale's marketing strategies for this ETF and their attempts to justify the high fee, I have not found any convincing reasons to support this expense ratio. I believe GBTC’s 1.50% expense ratio will determine the long-term underperformance of this ETF when compared to other ETFs or to Bitcoin itself. Therefore, I see no reason to choose GBTC over any of the other major Bitcoin ETFs, or opting for self-custody. Grayscale's reasons for choosing GBTC amount to little more than puffery According to Grayscale , the objective of GBTC is “to reflect the value of BTC held by the Trust, determined by reference to the Index Price, less the Trust's expenses and other liabilities.”. This objective is all in all very similar to that of the IBIT ETF, that BlackRock states as “[seeking] to reflect generally the performance of the price of bitcoin.”. The difference between the two ETFs is their expense ratio. While IBIT’s expense ratio is 0.25%, GBTC is charging a hefty 1.50%. The question is: why? Visiting the “WHY GBTC” section of the GBTC website, Grayscale offers three reasons why investing in their Bitcoin fund: Created in 2013, GBTC has the longest operational history as the first publicly-traded Bitcoin fund. As GBTC's sponsor since inception, Grayscale is one of the only asset managers with a decade of experience operating a Bitcoin investment vehicle that is regulated by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. As an actively traded spot Bitcoin ETF, GBTC offers investors high flexibility to manage their positions. I believe most of these reasons are puffery claims that can hardly justify choosing this ETF. I wouldn't recommend one fund over another based solely on a longer history. Especially for a passive fund that invests in one asset, a decade of asset management experience offers no clear advantage over other issuers. The fact that the fund is actively traded as an ETF does not represent a point of difference whatsoever compared to other ETFs, either. In my opinion, Grayscale could try to market the ETF’s liquidity as a point of differentiation. At the time of writing, the GBTC ETF still is the largest Bitcoin ETF by size , and it has the lowest bid-ask spread among Bitcoin ETFs, at 0.02%. While these two elements are still not enough for me to recommend GBTC, at the very least they represent an actual point of difference for this ETF. Performance will start lagging behind and the ETF will shrink Bitcoin ETFs have only recently been approved. Performance between ETFs is therefore still comparable, to date. The difference in expense ratio only starts compounding significantly after a few years . GBTC vs IBIT performance (Seeking Alpha) Given how GBTC has a 1.50% expense ratio, it is a mathematical certainty that this ETF will underperform against IBIT and other ETFs with expense ratios between 0.10% and 0.25%. The GBTC ETF has also experienced significant outflows since its conversion to an ETF in January 2024. While the fund has experienced its first day of net asset inflows in April, it has significantly decreased in size since January. I believe it is very likely that GBTC will lose its status as the largest Bitcoin ETFs in the next few weeks. Why does GBTC exist? The question, considering how GBTC is marketed, is why it exists in the first place. The answer lies mostly in its history. GBTC was launched in 2013 as one of the very first global investment funds focused on Bitcoin. For years the fund was effectively the only way for investors to access Bitcoin via a traditional brokerage account. In that context, its high expense ratio was justified given the lack of options. Grayscale was one of the main entities pushing for a Bitcoin ETF. Large part of the reason why Bitcoin ETFs were approved back in January had to do with Grayscale winning a lawsuit against the SEC. However, after the conversion of GBTC to an ETF, there simply are better, cheaper alternatives available. It remains to be seen whether Grayscale will act and lower its fees to match those of BlackRock and other issuers. If that were to happen, the GBTC ETF would actually be very competitive in the Bitcoin ETFs market. Comparison between Bitcoin ETFs, including GBTC (Author's elaboration of publicly available data) As shown in my table above, the GBTC ETF enjoys the best average bid-ask spread and (still, to date) the most assets under management. If Grayscale was interested in making this ETF competitive, it could simply match IBIT’s expense ratio. By doing so, it would become the most liquid Bitcoin ETF on the market, and I would personally recommend it as a top choice to invest in Bitcoin. Risks to my thesis In this article, I have analyzed GBTC as a means of gaining exposure to Bitcoin. The primary risk with GBTC is linked to Bitcoin itself, a notably volatile asset currently trading near its all-time highs. While not a direct discussion on investing in Bitcoin, it's important for investors to understand the risks involved. Another potential risk is if Grayscale decides to reduce its expense ratio to match those of IBIT and other major Bitcoin ETFs. Should this occur, as I mentioned earlier, GBTC would become a highly attractive ETF for Bitcoin exposure. Conclusion The GBTC ETF falls short as a viable option for investing in Bitcoin. GBTC is convenient as an ETF, as it can be purchased via any major brokerage. However, its expense ratio is over five times higher than that of its closest competitors. If you already have GBTC in your portfolio, it might be wise to wait a few more months to see whether Grayscale has any plans to decrease its expense ratio. For this reason, my final recommendation for GBTC is a ""HOLD"". If you're considering investing in Bitcoin and don't currently own GBTC, I recommend avoiding this ETF and opting for one of the major ones instead, such as BlackRock's IBIT.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4690006-gbtc-expecting-underperformance-compared-to-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/27008128.jpeg

The regulator is attempting to crack down on people trying to avoid paying their tax liabilities.  The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has asked cryptocurrency exchanges to provide the personal data and transaction details of up to 1.2 million accounts, according to reports.  The Australian Financial Review reported on Monday that “as part of a surveillance effort announced in April, the ATO said its latest data collection protocol would require designated cryptocurrency exchanges to provide the names, addresses, birthdays and transaction details of traders to help it audit compliance with obligations to pay capital gains tax on sales.”  The ATO said the data would help identify traders who failed to report their cryptocurrency-related activities, including the exchange of crypto assets when they sold it for currency or used it to pay for goods and services, Reuters reported on Tuesday.  Australia’s crackdown on the crypto industry has been more evident since the collapse of FTX. It has sued companies for attempting to sell tokens without the appropriate licenses, banking partners have blocked payments to cryptocurrency exchanges and has proposed a new licensing regime for crypto exchanges.

42390899,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPQI3,1715063546,Bitcoin Rebound Has Crypto Options Traders Anticipating $100K,"Bitcoin rebound spurs demand for out-of-the-money calls at strikes from $70,000 to $100,000.  Analysts said the path of least resistance for bitcoin is on the higher side.  Bitcoin's {{BTC}} renewed price upswing has options traders reconsidering the possibility of the cryptocurrency reaching the $100,000 level at some point this year.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value has risen over 12% to $63,470 since Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell ruled out additional tightening or rate hikes as the next policy move last Wednesday, CoinDesk data show. Friday's disappointing U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP) data validated Powell's stance, accelerating BTC's recovery.  As such, there has been a notable increase in demand for bitcoin call options on leading cryptocurrency exchange Deribit and over-the-counter (OTC) networks. These options are specifically targeting a rally to new highs, potentially surpassing $75,000 and even reaching $100,000.  ""We are seeing some bullish follow-through in volatility and rates following the reversal bounce from Friday and into the weekend. BTC risk reversals have gone positive (calls more expensive than puts), and [there has been a] renewed demand for BTC Sep expiry $75,000 and $100,000 calls,"" QCP Capital said in a note on Monday.  A call option gives the right to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market and a put option buyer is bearish.  OTC institutional cryptocurrency trading network Paradigm made a similar observation Monday, stating increased demand for out-of-the-money (OTM) calls or those at strikes well above BTC's going market rate.  ""The options market seemed to anticipate a short-term leg higher up earlier this morning with top BTC and ETH trades on Paradigm consisting of OTM calls bought in size. We noticed the previous March 25 [expiry] $200,000 call buyer closing his position to buy the July 2024 [expiry] $85,000 strike,"" Paradigm said in a Telegram broadcast.  Data from Deribit show traders have locked in over $688 million in the $100,000 strike call options across different maturities. That's the highest notional open interest among all options listed on the exchange.  As of writing, more than 150,000 call option contracts worth $9.5 billion were active on Deribit. That's more than two times the open interest in put options, a sign of bullish market expectations.  Notional open interest refers to the dollar value locked in the number of active or open contracts. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC or one ether {{ETH}}.  Analysts bullish on BTC  Both fundamental and technical analysts are again coalesced around on the idea that the path of least resistance for bitcoin is on the higher side.  ""Bitcoin continues to be supported by the U.S. election cycle and ongoing deficit spending. This is why we have adjusted our 'line in the sand' from 68,300 to 62,000 in our report from May 3 — the market could trade (tactically) bullish above 62,000,"" 10X Research said.  Siwssblock Insights expects the dollar index (DXY) to remain defensive unless Powell's stance is challenged. A weaker DXY is usually good for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.The DXY has declined by 1.2% to 105.20 since Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting.  ""The dollar's weaker position is likely to persist as long aseconomic data remains supportive of that direction and as long as Federal Reserve officials don't counter Powell's stance. The labor market is showing signs of loosening, but more hawkish Fed voices could still push for keeping rates higher for longer, which may impact the dollar's trajectory,"" Swissblock Insights latest newsletter said.  Meanwhile, Elliot wave analysis by John Glover, chief investment officer of Ledn, suggests bitcoin's could rise to 92,000.  ‘The BTC price action continues to track my expected path for Wave 4 as can be seen in the chart below. Although the dip to $56.5k may have completed the correction, I still expect to see a price of $52-55k before Wave 4 completes, 2/ Once the 4th wave is completed I expect that the Wave 5 push to circa $92k will ensue,"" Glover said in an email to CoinDesk.  Ralph Nelson Elliott introduced the Elliot wave theory in 1938 in his book The Wave Principle. The theory assumes that asset price movements can be predicted by observing and identifying a repetitive wave pattern.  Trends unfold in five waves, of which 1,3 and 5 are impulse waves, representing the primary trend, while 2 and 4 show temporary retracements of the preceding impulse waves.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/07/bitcoin-rebound-has-crypto-options-traders-anticipating-100k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2cfe50a8af99d33d57e1ea60cf106416c74c451c-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price is stable above the $0.5240 support and might aim for a fresh increase in the near term. XRP started a decent increase and climbed above the $0.550 resistance. The price is now trading above $0.5250 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5320 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if the bulls defend the $0.5240 support. XRP Price Holds Support Recently, XRP price started a decent increase above the $0.5250 resistance zone. The bulls even pushed the price above the $0.550 resistance zone before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $0.5699 before there was a pullback like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price dipped below the $0.550 support zone. The price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4787 swing low to the $0.5699 high. However, the price is now stable above $0.5250 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5320 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair. Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com Immediate resistance is near the $0.5480 level. The first key resistance is near $0.570. A close above the $0.570 resistance zone could spark a strong increase. The next key resistance is near $0.5850. If the bulls remain in action above the $0.5850 resistance level, there could be a rally toward the $0.620 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.680 resistance. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5480 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5320 level and the trend line. The next major support is at $0.5240 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5240 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could retest the $0.50 support zone.

26994913,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606766,1715047205,Bitcoin To Reach Escape Velocity? Analyst Makes The Case,"An analyst has explained how Bitcoin seems to be showing a good setup to reach escape velocity based on the trend in this indicator. Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator Has Been Showing A Bullish Divergence As explained by analyst Willy Woo in a new post on X, a bullish divergence has appeared to be forming in the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) oscillator of the cryptocurrency. The VWAP is an indicator that calculates an average price for any given asset, taking into account not only the price but also the volume. More formally, it’s calculated as the cumulative price sum multiplied by the volume divided by the cumulative volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin Relative Open Interest Lowest Since Feb, Analyst Says “Hard To Be Bearish” This metric puts a higher weight on the price at which more volume is traded. Usually, the exchange-reported volume is used to find the metric, but for a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, the entire transaction history is visible to the public thanks to blockchain data. Woo has used on-chain volume instead to calculate the VWAP for BTC. The VWAP oscillator, the actual indicator of interest here, is a ratio between the asset’s spot price and VWAP. Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in this metric over the past couple of years: The value of the metric seems to have been on the decline in recent days | Source: @woonomic on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin VWAP oscillator has been in the negative territory for the past month but has recently shown a turnaround. Although the metric is heading up, it’s still very much contained inside the red zone. At the same time as this rise, the cryptocurrency’s price has been heading down instead. According to Woo, this is a bullish divergence forming for the asset and it’s also one that has a “lot of room to run,” since tops in the coin have generally occurred when the oscillator has reached a point of reversal at relatively high levels inside the positive zone, which should still be quite far away. “Seems like a good setup for BTC to reach escape velocity,” notes the analyst. It remains to be seen whether the bullish divergence will end up bearing fruits for the asset. In some other news, the Bitcoin whales (investors carrying 1,000 BTC or more) participated in buying around the recent lows of the asset. Still, market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has revealed that the accumulation sprees from these large investors have been displaying an overall downtrend. The trend in the netflow of the BTC whales over the past couple of months | Source: IntoTheBlock on X From the chart, it’s visible that the Bitcoin whales have been buying at each of the dips in the last few months, but it’s also visible that the scale of this buying has been diminishing with each one.

42390882,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPPDN,1715047105,Ethereum Developers Target Ease of Crypto Wallets With 'EIP-3074',"As blockchain teams strive for the holy grail of mainstream adoption, making crypto wallets easier to use is suddenly at the top of the agenda.  Ethereum developers have been moving along with their discussions and inclusions of certain Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) for the blockchain’s next big hard fork, Pectra.  One of the proposals that has drawn both support and concern from the Ethereum community is EIP-3074, a code change that is supposed to improve the user experience with wallets on the blockchain.  Ethereum developers have tackled issues in the past that would make the user experience with wallets easier, and have deployed features that unlocked newer capabilities. But now, developers are pushing to make the experience even easier, and enshrined in the blockchain.  This new change is supposed to allow a specific type of wallet, externally owned accounts (EOAs), to be more programmable, by allowing smart contracts to authorize them.  Paradigm Chief Technology Officer Georgios Konstatonopolous said on X that EIP-3074 “is a big deal. Wallet UX will 10x.”  Currently on Ethereum, there are two types of wallet accounts: EOAs, which are the most popular, like MetaMask and Coinbase wallet, and smart contract wallets, like Argent and Safe.  Users of EOA accounts are given a pair of keys – a public one and private one – while smart contract accounts are wallets that are controlled by code. The problem with EOAs comes down to human error; if you lose a private key to an EOA account, there is no help desk or key recovery process that can help you regain access to your funds.  Previous proposals, like ERC-4337, have aimed to make EOAs easier to use, a concept known as account abstraction (AA), which allows users to recover their crypto with smart contract features.  EIP-3074 is another step in this type of innovation, delegating transaction capabilities to smart contracts. A key component of the proposal is to allow users to batch transactions together and have them sign off on it once. Other features include having third parties sponsor users' transaction fees, so decentralized applications (dapps) can for instance cover the gas costs for their users.  The proposal, created as far back as October 2020, also allows for users to sign transactions that were submitted by a different party – for example, signing transactions from a different interface, or signing them offline. The authors are Sam Wilson, Ansgar Dietrichs, Matt Garnett and Micah Zoltu, according to the document.  The key difference between EIP-3074 and ERC-4337 is that “the former focuses on getting all the benefits of execution abstraction, and the latter focuses on getting all the benefits of account abstraction on all EVM chains but in a non-native way that is less efficient,” Ethereum Foundation developer Yoav Weiss writes. “Both are steps to get some of the benefits of full native account abstraction.”  Community pushback  While many in the community showed their support for the proposal, others have cautioned moving forward with this over security concerns with the batched transactions feature.  Lukas Schor, the co-founder at Safe that has advocated for ERC-4337 and for Ethereum wallets to implement full account abstraction, voiced concerns that while this proposal does move in the right direction, he fears the EIP lacks “any clear pathway to full AA and has a net-negative impact on AA adoption.”  The co-founder of Argent wallet, Itamar Lesuisse, also posted on X that EIP-3074 might be a serious security concern, writing that it allows “a scammer to drain your entire wallet with a single off-chain signature. I expect this will be a major use case.”  Mudit Gupta, chief information security officer at Polygon Labs, also had security concerns, calling for wallets to “ban EIP-3074 MAGIC signatures on a per wallet basis.”  “For security reasons, I do not want to expose my cold wallets to AA batching,” Gupta added.

26992435,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606799,1715043654,Ethereum Burn Rate Hits Yearly Low: What This Means For ETH’s Future,"In recent weeks, Ethereum has displayed subtle signs of recovery amidst a generally bearish crypto market, with the altcoin mimicking Bitcoin’s modest uptrend. Despite Ethereum’s price increasing slightly by 0.2% over the last 24 hours, a parallel trend that might significantly affect Ethereum’s economic model has been unfolding beneath the surface. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Back? Record 267,000 New Users Spark Speculation Decline In Network Activity Reduces ETH Burn April witnessed Ethereum’s ETH burn rate hitting an annual low, primarily due to a significant decrease in network transaction fees. These fees have typically fluctuated just below 10 gwei this year, but recent weeks have seen them dip to some of the lowest levels, directly influencing the rate at which ETH is burned. This reduced burn rate is evidenced by the stark drop in daily burned ETH, which reached a low of 671 ETH in the past day a notable decrease from the daily figures of 2,500–3,000 ETH seen earlier in the year. Such a decline in burn rate is not merely a statistical anomaly but a reflection of broader shifts within the Ethereum network. A significant factor contributing to the lowered gas fees is the increased migration of network activities to Layer 2 solutions, which enhance transaction speeds while lowering costs. Moreover, innovations like blob transactions, introduced in Ethereum’s recent Dencun upgrade, have further optimized costs on these secondary layers. Notably, Blobs are a feature introduced to enhance Ethereum’s compatibility with Layer 2 solutions like zkSync, Optimism, and Arbitrum by efficiently managing data storage needs. This functionality is part of the Dencun upgrade, which integrates proto-danksharding via EIP-4844. While beneficial in reducing transaction fees, these technological strides pose challenges to Ethereum’s deflationary mechanisms. This upgrade introduced a new fee structure in which a part of every transaction fee, the base fee, is burned, potentially reducing the overall ETH supply. However, with decreased transaction fees, the anticipated deflationary pressure via burning has softened, signaling a shift to a more inflationary trend in the short term. According to Ultrasoundmoney, Ethereum’s supply dynamics have swung to a mildly inflationary mode with a growth rate of 0.498%. This shift could realign if network activity intensifies, leading to increased transaction fees and, consequently, higher burn rates. Ethereum Market Response Despite these underlying network dynamics, Ethereum’s market price has struggled to regain its former highs above $3,500. The asset trades around $3,085, reflecting a slight downturn over recent weeks. This price behavior underscores the broader market’s reaction to internal network changes and external economic factors, such as regulatory struggles from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and macroeconomic uncertainties.

This has prompted expectations that the altcoin will go on a rally from here. However, not everyone shares this sentiment as one crypto analyst expects the price to crash further from here. Cardano Will Crash Back Below $0.45 In the latest video on his YouTube channel that revolved around Cardano’s future trajectory, crypto analyst, ‘More Crypto Online’, revealed why the ADA price is poised for more decline. The analyst pointed out that the altcoin is currently in its 3-wave corrective rally. Related Reading: Fantom Revival: Crypto Analyst Predicts A Jump To $1.2 For FTM Price Now, the Elliot Wave Theory which is being referred to by the crypto analyst consists of five waves. Out of the five, three are bullish and two are bearish. The bullish waves involve the 1, 3, and 5, with 2 and 4 being bearish waves. If the analyst is correct and the Cardano price has only completed three waves so far, that means the fourth wave, which is a bearish wave, is yet to be established. As a result, the crypto analyst believes that the Cardano price will further break down as it enters the fourth wave. He further pointed out that the altcoin’s price had fallen below the $0.48 support, which was an important level for it. This, coupled with the fact that it is yet to enter the fourth wave, has the analyst convinced that the price crash is far from over. As for where the ADA price might end up in this fourth wave, the crypto analyst believes it will go as low as $0.42 before recovering again. However, the good news is that once the fourth wave is completed, it gives way for the fifth wave to begin, which is the most bullish of all the waves and could see the ADA price barrel past $1. ADA Metrics Still Bullish Despite the bearish outlook presented by the crypto analyst, major Cardano metrics continue to show bullish divergence. For example, the daily trading volume of the altcoin has risen almost 17% in the last day to cross $286 million, data from CoinMarketCap shows. Related Reading: Why Did The Solana (SOL) Price Jump Today? This drastic rise in daily trading volume suggests a return of interest in the altcoin and this could quickly translate to a bullish trend, especially in the short term. Additionally, the fact that the price is on the rise at this time suggests that the majority of the transactions as a result of this renewed interest is from buyers rather than sellers. This suggests that the price will continue to rise if this demand is sustained. At the time of writing, ADA is still sitting firmly above $0.45, with a 1.78% increase in the last day.
