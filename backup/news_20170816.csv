In new remarks to CoinDesk, Naval Ravikant, the co-founder of AngelList, revealed he intends to sponsor a prize that will be awarded to anyone who can develop a version of Twitter with no central authority, and where users are able to monetize their contributions.  The capital is being made available as part of an initiative that will provide financial assistance to entrepreneurs seeking to build blockchain applications on the Blockstack platform.  While details about the prize remain sparse, Ravikant told CoinDesk:  ""I am indeed helping the Blockstack team and will be donating a small prize for a decentralized microblogging service.""  Blockstack's competition is modeled off the prestigious XPRIZE, established in 1995 by entrepreneur Peter Diamandis and Google director Ray Kurzweil to reward innovators who tackle some of the world's largest problems.  Yet, the prizes, which require builders use Blockstack’s suite of tools for creating decentralized apps, are part of a larger push by the company to connect developers to capital.  Also today, the New York-based startup launched the Blockstack Signature Fund, a $25 million venture capital fund backed by Lux Capital, OpenOcean, RisingTide Capital, Compound and VersionOne.

As previously reported by CoinDesk, CULedger members are seeking to use blockchain in a bid to reimagine how they exchange data and provide services to their clients.  The project has grown steadily since its unveiling in 2016. Now, the credit unions that back it are forming what is known as a credit union service organization, or CUSO, centered around blockchain. A CUSO is a business entity, typically owned by a group of federally chartered credit unions, that provide certain services such as business loan originations or payment card processing.  In the case of CULedger, the CUSO will function as a bridging point between all of the credit unions that opt to link up with the project's permissioned ledger.  Rudy Pereira, chairman of the CULedger steering committee, said in a statement:  ""CULedger is an opportunity for credit unions to be leaders of innovation in financial services. Getting involved now in CULedger and CULedger, LCC will offer credit unions the ability to participate in shared-ledger technology that is on path to reshape the credit union industry as a whole in the years to come.""  While a big step for the group, the new CUSO isn't operational yet. Over the next several months, CULedger will host events for credit unions in a bid to find investors.  As part of that search, CULedger will begin looking for a CEO to take the helm of the venture as well.

Announced today, ShapeShift will continue to use the KeepKey brand, and its staff will stay on to continue working on the hardware product line. KeepKey had originally integrated with ShapeShift by way of its API last summer.  The deal – the terms of which were not disclosed – represents the first acquisition of a startup specifically focused on hardware products.  ""This partnership will not only guarantee the future success of the KeepKey brand and product line, but joining the ShapeShift team will enable us to focus on continuing to work on developing better technology and security for crypto-holders,"" Ken Hodler, KeepKey's chief technology officer, said in a statement.  The deal comes months after ShapeShift closed a $10.4 million funding round. At the time, the exchange drew on a list of backers that included Earlybird Venture Capital, which led the round.  It also follows a move by KeepKey to end its support late last month for the long-running MultiBit bitcoin wallet. KeepKey first acquired MultiBit in May 2016.

42379784,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KerD,1502897706,"Block 494,784: Segwit2x Developers Set Date for Bitcoin Hard Fork","The developers behind Segwit2x, a controversial plan to increase the transaction capacity of the bitcoin blockchain, plan to announce a firm date for a hard fork today.  A copy of a forthcoming blog post obtained by CoinDesk indicates that the Segwit2x team plans to enable bitcoin's miners to elect to run new software at block 494,784 on the blockchain, a block they expect will occur sometime in November of this year.  The announcement, while not yet public, is expected to be released formally later today. Entitled, ""Bitcoin Upgrade at Block 494,784,"" the draft post is currently live on a website related to the project.  The post reads:  ""During the month of November 2017, approximately 90 days after the activation of Segregated Witnesses in the Bitcoin blockchain, a block between 1MB and 2MB in size will be generated by bitcoin miners in a move to increase network capacity. At this point it is expected that more than 90% of the computational capacity that secures the bitcoin network will carry on mining on top of this large block.""  If enacted, Segwit2x could enable a second hard fork of the bitcoin network in 2017, one that could also result in the creation of yet another version of the bitcoin blockchain with its own unique cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin Cash, created through a hard fork on August 1, is currently trading at just over $300.  Announced in May, Segwit2x is an agreement supported by more than 50 industry startups, miners and technologists and organized by industry investor Digital Currency Group. To date, its developer team has drawn support mainly from industry startups.  Still with a portion of bitcoin's mining network backing the new bitcoin cash blockchain, it remains to be seen just how many miners on either chain would dedicate computing power to yet another blockchain.  For one, there is already a live version of the blockchain that supports larger blocks. Secondly, with the adoption of SegWit on the bitcoin blockchain, its proponents argue block size is no longer an effective metric for capacity.

42379774,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KesT,1502895655,AMD Releases New Software Package for Cryptocurrency Mining,"Graphics card (GPU) maker AMD is rolling out new software geared specifically for cryptocurrency mining.  As detailed on its website, the ""Radeon Software Crimson ReLive Edition Beta for Blockchain Compute"" is described as a beta-level driver aimed at improving the performance of GPUs used for mining, the process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain, creating new tokens as a reward along the way.  AMD's release comes amid a period of growing demand for GPUs, which is being driven by elevated prices in markets for cryptocurrencies like ether, the native currency on the ethereum blockchain.  Indeed, both AMD and rival chip maker Nvidia have been taking advantage of the boom for graphics cards.  Both  companies have issued statements on the subject in recent days, though in the case of AMD, the company has taken a somewhat bearish stance on the future of the cryptocurrency mining market.  Positions aside, the rush to acquire GPUs in pursuit of profits has had an effect on the revenues for both firms – last week, Nvidia's CEO declared that cryptocurrencies are ""here to say"".  That said, the release of the driver – a piece of software that enables computers to communicate with hardware components – signals that AMD is looking to keep miners around, at least in the near-term. AMD published the driver as a beta release, noting that it ""will not be supported with further updates, upgrades or bug fixes.""

42379778,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KexV,1502889027,Swiss Bank to Sell Ether and Bitcoin Cash to Customers,"A private Swiss bank is expanding a digital asset management service it launched earlier this summer to include new cryptocurrencies.  Falcon Private Bank, as previously reported by CoinDesk, revealed that it would allow its customers to buy and hold bitcoin within their accounts through a partnership with brokerage service Bitcoin Suisse. The launch was said to come after consultations with Swiss regulators, including the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).  Now, that product line is expanding to include ether, litecoin and bitcoin cash. Customers of the bank will be able to start buying and holding those cryptocurrencies from August 22, according to today's announcement.  It’s a notable development, given that the initial service was brought online just over a month ago, marking the first time a traditional bank has moved to offer cryptocurrency services to its clients. As of last year, Falcon Private Bank had more than $14 billion in assets under its control.  ""Falcon Private Bank was the first bank to offer bitcoin directly to its clients, and thus created history,"" Bitcoin Suisse CEO Niklas Nikolajsen said in a statement. ""Their decision to follow up by adding ether as well as other crypto-assets has made them the go-to private bank for crypto-asset holders and investors.""  At the time of its bitcoin service launch, Falcon also moved to install a bitcoin ATM in its Zurich headquarters.

42379777,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KewF,1502885731,"Bitcoin Down $100 as Price Seeks Support Above $4,000","After its worst-performing day in weeks, the price of bitcoin was again down to start the day on Wednesday.  At press time, average bitcoin prices were down just over $120 across major exchanges, declining from an opening value of $4,204 at 0:00 UTC to $4,080. The drop comes a day after the bitcoin price shed $178 in value on Tuesday, declining from $4,382 to $4,204, and in between, setting a new all-time high.  CoinDesk data reveals Tuesday was the worst day for the bitcoin price in over 20 days, as the near-$200 decline was the most observed since July 25, a time when the network was facing uncertainty over a coming software change.  The finding suggests that, despite heading over $4,000 amidst a wave of press mentions and new interest, volatility could be ahead as the price tries to maintain support at its new levels. The day has already seen sub-$4,000 levels, with the price hitting a low of $3,985 today.  Over the last 10-days, the price of bitcoin has seen three days of declines, but also five days in which it rose by more than $200, according to BPI data. Such volatility, however, is common amongst the nascent asset class.  Bitcoin's dip, for instance, also coincides with a drop in the value of all public cryptocurrencies, with the total asset class now worth $136 billion, down from $141 billion earlier this week, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

42379782,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Kf2X,1502884750,ICO Meets VC: Blockstack Raises $25 Million for Decentralized Internet Fund,"While initial coin offerings (ICOs) have fast become the breakout method for blockchain fundraising, at least one industry startup thinks there's still a place for traditional venture capital in this new economic movement.  Today, New York-based Blockstack is launching a $25 million venture capital fund aimed at jumpstarting a new, decentralized version of the internet. But more notable than the money, is who's allocating it. Unlike the many ICOs that are raising funds through retail investors, the Blockstack Signature Fund will only distribute money from active venture capitalists.  As such, Blockstack co-founder Muneeb Ali positioned the fund as a way to bring together decentralized app builders and the venture capital community.  Ali told CoinDesk:  ""What we are doing is opening up this channel between app developers on Blockstack and venture capital, so that [developers] can actually go and talk to these investors, get feedback from them and then potentially get some money to build out their apps.""  The fund is backed by venture capital firms Lux Capital, OpenOcean, RisingTide Capital, Compound and VersionOne.  Each firm has committed resources to the fund, and will evaluate investment opportunities in exchange for a stake in the innovator's company on a case-by-case basis. Currently, Blockstack isn't releasing the fund's expected average investment size, but those involved predict it will be equivalent to a traditional Series A funding round.  ""We think that traditional venture capital has its place, and a very important place in this ecosystem, along with these new ways of raising money,"" Ali said.  ICO in the works  That's not to say the company is eschewing the ICO strategy for itself, however.  Founded in 2013, Blockstack has so far raised $5.45 million in venture capital to build a decentralized protocol layer that sits on top of a number of blockchains, including bitcoin, ethereum and zcash.  With an entire stack of tools similar to those provided by Apple to its app developers, and a recently released decentralized internet browser the founders compare to Netscape, Blockstack hopes to integrate any number of distributed ledgers into a single layer that's easily browsable from any device.  But to get to that next step, Blockstack plans to raise additional funding via an ICO, in which it will sell its own cryptocurrency to set a precedent for other apps that will use its platform.  According to Ali:  ""When we feel that the platform is ready and we can actually enable it for some of our developers, then you will see something [on Blockstack's platform] very similar to ERC-20 [an ethereum token standard], but we believe it will be much-better fleshed out and easier to use in production.""  Blockchain 'x-prize'  Blockstack also revealed that it's in the early stages of launching an award, modeled after the renowned XPRIZE established by entrepreneur Peter Diamandis and Google director Ray Kurzweil to incentivize radical technological development that benefits humanity.  While original XPRIZE participants have created everything from space travel solutions to Star Trek-inspired medical devices, Blockstack's ""x-prize"" will be focused on motivating developers to build solutions to some of blockchain’s oldest unfulfilled promises, ranging from a decentralized Twitter to a decentralized publishing platform like Medium.  Details about which investors will back the awards are forthcoming, but Ali hinted that two of Blockstack's most well-known investors might be keen, saying:  ""Some high-profile investors are willing to put up these prizes for specific apps. We’re pretty excited about that, but we’re ironing out the details.""

In an August 11 news post, the City of London Police said that they had detained a man they believed was part of a group that was cold-calling people in the U.K. and offering them cryptocurrency investments. The ""boiler room"" operation was run out of an office in the City of London, the capital's financial center, the report said.  But despite persuading some individuals to invest in the scheme, the cryptocurrency apparently never existed. The police said those involved were able to make £160,000 (roughly $205,000) through the scheme.
