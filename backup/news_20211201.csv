13221862,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=477926,1638403141,How Thai Crypto Unicorn Bitkub Plans to Become the Coinbase of Asia,"Thailand startup Bitkub Capital Group Holdings, founded in 2018, hit unicorn status last month notching up a valuation of over $1 billion. Now the crypto exchange intends to expand over Malaysia, the Philippines, and Laos, aiming to become &apos;the Coinbase of Southeast Asia&apos;, said the chief executive officer Jirayut Srupsrisopa. The Bangkok-based crypto exchange is aiming for huge growth during 2022 as it looks for the possibilities for partnership in Southeast Asia and setting up its own units, Bloomberg reported. Part of the strategy focuses on monopolizing in countries that lack bigger players, which opens the doors to dominate the field. Our strategy is to expand in countries that have no clear winners yet and are under-banked, with high social media usage and the potential to use cryptocurrency for remittances, … The expansion will be achieved either through new ventures or acquisitions. The goal is to become the Coinbase of Southeast Asia. The American company Coinbase Global Inc. is a crypto assets marketplace, and its technology provides a way to build crypto-based applications, among other services. It says on the Coinbase website that they roughly have &apos;73 million verified users, 10,000 institutions, and 185,000 ecosystem partners in over 100 countries trust Coinbase to easily and securely invest, spend, save, earn, and use crypto.&apos; Related Reading | Coinbase Will Invest 10% Of Its Profits I...",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/how-thai-crypto-unicorn-bitkup-plans-to-become-the-coinbase-of-asia/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42396425,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT3Fos,1638401450,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Drops Following First US Omicron Case,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Crypto markets opened December with mixed performances as traders remain in a wait-and-see mode.  Technician’s take: BTC’s uptrend is intact with improving price momentum. Downside appears to be limited around the $53K-$55K support zone.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $57,095 -0.2%  Ether (ETH): $4,593 -1%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,513 -1.1%  Dow Jones Industrial Average: $34,022 -1.3%  Nasdaq: $15,254 -1.8%  Gold: $1,782 +.53%  Market moves  Bitcoin briefly dropped below $57,000 during U.S. trading hours on Wednesday after news broke that health officials in the country confirmed the first case of the new coronavirus variant, Omicron, in California. At the time of publication, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading just above $57,000 but still down for the day.  The drop wiped out bitcoin’s earlier gains when it increased above $59,000 from a low at roughly $55,920 a day ago. Stocks also fell, with the S&P 500 dropping by 0.49% on Wednesday.  One analyst remains positive about the potential Omicron’s long-term impact on crypto.  “While the new coronavirus variant has raised concerns over potentially tumbling down crypto prices, it is also essential to note that crypto markets had observed strong growth throughout [the pandemic],” Danny Chong, co-founder of Tranchess, a Binance Smart Chain-based, yield-enhancing, asset-tracking protocol, said via a representative.  Ether also retreated, down to about $4,575 from as high as $4,782.40, according to CoinDesk’s data, ending its four-day winning streak. As an investment asset, ether posted a strong monthly return in November, beating bitcoin and macro assets, including the S&P 500, gold and bonds.  But a few other layer 1 blockchain tokens remained in the green on Wednesday, including polygon (MATIC), terra (LUNA) and solana (SOL).  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Rangebound Between $55K Support and $60K Resistance  Bitcoin’s (BTC) price momentum is improving, which could limit further downside between the $53,000-$55,000 support range.  Buyers will need to make a decisive move above $60,000 resistance to yield an upside target toward the all-time price high of nearly $69,000.  For now, BTC is trading in a tight range and has been roughly flat over the past week. The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is rising from oversold levels of last week, which typically precedes a price bounce.  Support remains intact given the upward-sloping, 100-day moving average. This indicates a positive intermediate-term trend, which could encourage additional buying on pullbacks.

42420837,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYlPZ,1638401395,Can Stablecoin Supply Measure Ethereum Adoption?,"Interest in the cryptocurrency markets came roaring back this fall, with bitcoin and ether both breaking their previous all-time highs just weeks ago. However, shortly after the breakout things turned south, and the market took nearly a 25% dip.  While many investors and traders were calling for an end to the bull market, the stablecoin printer continued to pump new capital into every corner of crypto. Several billion-dollar funds were announced and institutional investors were taking part, arguably for the first time in the short history of the asset class.  The growth of stablecoin supply is likely correlated to decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL) for two reasons:  New capital is adding buy pressure to crypto assets, artificially boosting the dollar measure of TVL;  New capital is looking to be deployed throughout DeFi to earn yield on trading fees, lending yield and on-chain derivatives.  While it could be argued that new market entrants are coming to extract value from the market and leave, it appears that this must be a fringe case. Since the beginning of 2020, stablecoin supply has been almost “up only,” hinting that users may sell into stablecoins, but they are not leaving the industry.  The largest bear-case scenario boils down to the fact that most successful DeFi applications are currently used for further speculating on the future of crypto and not solving any real-world problems. However, promising use cases continue to arise, with prediction markets, gaming, 24/7 forex trading and undercollateralized loans all coming to fruition.  Regardless of short-term price action, the adoption of stablecoins and DeFi applications by funds, institutions and individuals is a positive for the industry. Innovation on top of Ethereum will continue to connect DeFi with the outside world, and stablecoin growth should continue to be a strong measure of adoption.  Welcome to another edition of Valid Points.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.  Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  Rari Capital and Fei Protocol are looking to undergo a token merger if the respective DAOs can agree. BACKGROUND: The founders of both protocols believe they can create a DeFi powerhouse by combining money markets and a decentralized stablecoin. The integration of the FEI stablecoin into Rari Capital could allow for readily available borrowing liquidity that will help stabilize periods of high demand.  DyDx plans to offer gas-free deposits from Ethereum to users of its platform. BACKGROUND: The cost of even a single transaction on Ethereum’s base layer is prohibitively high for many potential DeFi users, and DyDx is attempting at creating an easier path to onboarding new users. The news comes days after Binance decided to add support for withdrawals to Arbitrum.  Ethereum privacy application and mixer, Tornado Cash, looks ready to deploy on Arbitrum. BACKGROUND: Tornado Cash allows users to deposit ETH from one address and withdraw from another account, in order to maintain further on-chain privacy. The application is often used by DeFi exploiters or hackers to hide any trail of evidence. The Arbitrum integration will allow further use of the Ethereum roll-up, so users can stay on layer 2 and avoid high transaction costs.  Twitter’s CEO and bitcoin enthusiast Jack Dorsey stepped down and was replaced by Parag Agrawal. BACKGROUND: While Dorsey is interested in cryptocurrency, he was mainly interested in integrating bitcoin with one of the largest social media networks. Agrawal was part of the crypto team at Twitter and could provide a link between Ethereum and social media.

42396424,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT3Fpr,1638401174,Market Wrap: Analysts Expect Positive Bitcoin Returns in December,"Bitcoin was stuck in a tight trading range between $55,000 and $58,000 on Wednesday as some analysts expect bullish sentiment to return this month given positive seasonal trends.  The bitcoin Fear & Greed Index entered “extreme fear” territory during last week’s sell-off. The index is at the lowest level since late-September, which preceded a BTC price bounce. Additionally, technical indicators are starting to rise from oversold levels as price pullbacks remain limited.  “Here we see a classic market pattern: consolidation at an important level in September, a breakout and subsequent steady and methodical buying throughout October and the first half of November, and finally a period of correction and cooling off in November while maintaining significant levels,” Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  “Now, the correction and consolidation look complete, and the ether looks set to rewrite historical highs,” Kuptsikevich wrote.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $56,799, -1.0%  Ether (ETH): $4,568.9, -1.5%  S&P 500: -1.2%  Gold: $1,779, +0.2%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.421%  November pullbacks  Litecoin (LTC) and ether (ETH) outperformed the CoinDesk 20, which includes some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Bitcoin was down roughly 9% last month, while Cardano’s ADA token and dogecoin (DOGE) were down about 20% during the same period.  Outside of the CoinDesk 20, metaverse tokens generated significant returns in November. Arcane Research noted that Decentraland’s MANA token was up about 70% over the past month, which contributed to the overall price rise in tokens with smaller market capitalizations.  “We see that seven of the top 10 coins by market capitalization [generated] a negative weekly change in market share, meaning that the smaller coins are catching up [to large-cap coins],” Arcane Research wrote.  Additionally, layer one (L1) tokens are on the rise following the Ethereum blockchain network upgrade in early August. “High gas fees on the ETH chain have become a norm now,” Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  “This has forced participants to move to other L1 chains that provide cheaper & faster transactions over CeFi (centralized finance) and DeFi (decentralized finance) platforms. We expect this trend to continue going forward into the next quarter as well,” Balani wrote.  Strong December for bitcoin?  The chart below shows average returns for bitcoin by month. Typically, BTC has positive returns in the fourth quarter, which is why some traders remain poised for a year-end rally across cryptocurrencies. Based on seasonal data, however, BTC’s upside could be limited as January tends to produce negative returns.  Altcoin roundup  DEX aggregator 1inch raises $175 million Series B funding round: 1inch Network’s latest fundraising round was led by Amber Group, with more than 50 additional investors participating, CoinDesk’s Andrew Thurman reported. 1inch co-founder Sergej Kunz noted that 1inch, which previously closed funding rounds of $12 million and $2.8 million, is aiming to use the new money to bring in investment partners with institutional experience. The list of notable investors included Alameda Research, Celsius, Jane Street and VanEck.  Digital asset manager 21Shares announces Polygon exchange-traded product: The news sent the Ethereum sidechain’s MATIC token up 16% as of Wednesday afternoon, CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma reported. The new listing for the 21Shares’ ETP, which the company says is Europe’s first product linked to MATIC’s performance, comes after it was unveiled on the SIX Swiss Exchange last month. Polygon’s MATIC was recently trading at around $2.05, still well off its all-time high of $3 reached in May.  Metaverse tokens SAND and MANA big winners in November: Hype over the untapped value of the “metaverse” sent tokens such as Sandbox’s SAND, Decentraland’s MANA and others to all-time highs in November, amid surging interest from cryptocurrency traders and Wall Street alike. The price rallies followed Facebook’s announcement in October that it would rebrand as Meta, with a new mission that aims to “bring the metaverse to life.”  Relevant News  Jury in Kleiman v.

42396426,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT3Frp,1638398648,Hologram NFTs at Art Basel Miami Are Trying to Save the Oceans,"Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) masquerading as holograms, raising funds to save the oceans: It’s happening at this year’s Art Basel Miami Beach.  That’s where the Open Earth Foundation, a tech platform for climate action, is holding its OceanDrop NFT sale, following its CarbonDrop NFT sale earlier this year, which raised some $6.6 million.  (This year’s Art Basel event in Miami is a de facto crypto conference in light of 2021′s frantic enthusiasm for NFTs.)  Open Earth Foundation Executive Director Martin Wainstein says the goal is to use blockchain tech to accurately account for carbon in the atmosphere, as well as realize global agreements to preserve 30% of the ocean and 30% of the land.  The money raised from auctioning OceanDrop NFTs will be used for a new program called OpenOcean, said Wainstein. The effort will fund a project on Cocos Island off the coast of Costa Rica, supporting local nongovernmental organizations (NGO) and park ranger operations.  Read more: Artists Back ‘Green’ NFT Sale Citing Concerns Over Crypto’s Environmental Impact  OceanDrop, which is supported by the likes of SuperRare, DoinGud and RNDR, is attempting to push the envelope on NFT innovation. All the digital artworks and animations in the sale will feature holograms using holographic technologies such as Portl.  “We think this is going to be a very important role for museums that want to display digital sculptures and things like that,” Wainstein said.  The artists  The OceanDrop NFT auction includes contributions from 21 artists, a mix of established and up-and-coming names.  Included in that mix is Nicole Buffett, the estranged granddaughter of investing guru Warren Buffett. She had previously been working with Open Earth and also explored hologram versions of a dolphin-themed piece leading to the OceanDrop NFT.  Buffett has been working with NFTs for a little over a year now and has four collections on OpenSea, all of which have sold out.  “With all my NFT sales I like to support charitable causes with a portion of the proceeds going to different funds and different causes,” Buffett said in an interview. “I think there’s a lot of capacity, given the abundance of money generated in the space, to really be bringing in that culture of charity.”  Something Nicole Buffett gets asked about often is how her enthusiasm for crypto technology contrasts sharply with the views of her grandfather, who famously called bitcoin “rat poison squared.”  “I just think [crypto] is another language, it’s another financial language, and he’s not interested in learning it,” Buffet said. “But I love it. I’m not really that into traditional Wall Street portfolio, stock market stuff. So probably the way he feels about crypto is probably the way I feel about traditional finance.”  ‘Polarizing’  Academy Award–winning digital artist Kevin Mack is making his first foray into NFTs with OceanDrop. His piece is called “Nammu: Ancient Elder From The Distant Future.”  Mack says that while his work is fundamentally abstract, it’s heavily influenced by undersea life and reflects his growing up scuba diving in Santa Catalina, an island off the coast of Southern California.  The 30-year veteran of immersive art and computer graphics says he’s been “skirting around” NFTs for a long time now because the concept is “so polarizing for a lot of people.”  “There’s really a lot of strong advocates of the NFT thing and decentralized currency in general. And then there are people who think it’s actually not a good thing,” Mack told CoinDesk. “I think the biggest argument against it is this notion of imposing artificial scarcity on a thing that is infinitely reproducible without loss. So, I think there’s still a little ambivalence about it. But if they can raise money to help the ocean, then yeah, I was willing to participate.”  Ocean to ocean  Canada-based digital artist Will Selviz was born in Venezuela, grew up in Kuwait, and now faces the Pacific Ocean in Vancouver. The piece Selviz has donated is an animation called “Sin Agua No Hay Tiempo” (“Without Water There Is No Time”).  “I feel like my whole life I’ve moved from one sea to another, from one ocean to another,” Selviz told CoinDesk. “I don’t want to call it a duty or a job, but I’ve tried to help take care of those places wherever I’ve lived, and have taken part in beach cleanups and whatnot.”  Selviz, who did his first NFT drop about a month ago at NYC.NFT, is also the founder of the RENDRD Foundation (not to be confused with RNDR, the token), whose main goal is to provide access to underrepresented communities, such as Black youth, within the digital animation industry.  “All these things got me down this rabbit hole of figuring out how to fundraise and build a community through NFTs and crypto,” Selviz said.  Humbled  For the Open Earth Foundation’s Wainstein, the CarbonDrop NFT sale back in March was life-changing. As a result, Open Earth established both crypto and traditional endowments to maintain climate accounting research for the next nine years, said Wainstein.  “At the beginning of the year, I wouldn’t have been comfortable launching parallel programs,” Wainstein said. “But because of the CarbonDrop, we’ve established a structure as an NGO that enables us to scale.”  Asked if he expects to raise as much as the CarbonDrop sale, Wainstein says he likes to be humble when it comes to fundraising targets.  “Our target for success is $250,000,” Wainstein said. “It’s about what’s the minimum amount that we need to launch a program that will make a dent in the sector. And that’s roughly what we think is the minimum to launch a program, to hire a team of oceanographers and blockchain experts to work together.”",POSITIVE,RNDR,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | RNDR,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/01/hologram-nfts-at-art-basel-miami-are-trying-to-save-the-oceans,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/59439e8328bea572dc6131f951fafcd083e1d317-5760x3840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375616,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9I2v,1638392529,Facebook Owner Meta Relaxes Crypto Ad Policies,"Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has updated its criteria for running cryptocurrency ads on its platform by expanding the number of accepted regulatory licenses from three to 27. The company is also making that list public for the first time, with the accepted licenses appearing on the policy page.  The tech giant splits crypto companies into two categories depending on whether prior written approval is needed to list ads. Tax services, news outlets and education sources related to crypto don’t need prior approval, nor do crypto wallets that only allow users to store assets without buying and selling. Crypto exchanges and trading platforms, full-service crypto wallets and mining-related hardware and software companies all require approval.  Advertisers needing approval previously had to submit several pieces of information to determine their eligibility, including whether they were publicly traded, any licenses obtained and other background information. Going forward, Meta will simply require one of the 27 licenses issued from regions around the world. The list includes Financial Conduct Authority Authorisation in the United Kingdom and the BitLicense issued by New York State.  “We’re doing this because the cryptocurrency landscape has continued to mature and stabilize in recent years and has seen more government regulations that are setting clearer rules for their industry,” said the Meta for Business team in the announcement post.  Advertisers who were already approved won’t be impacted by the change. Certain crypto products and services will continue to require written pre-approval. The list includes cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms, crypto wallets and mining-related hardware and software.  Facebook has warmed to the crypto industry since the 2018 ad ban. The company started lifting those restrictions the following year, which is also when Facebook first announced its stablecoin project (now called Libra) that has yet to fully launch.

Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) has expressed significant concerns about the crypto track records of President Joe Biden’s nominees to head the Federal Reserve for its next term, current Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Fed Governor Lael Brainard.  As a result, Lummis is likely to oppose the nominations and rally other senators against them unless the Fed addresses her concerns, an aide to Lummis told CoinDesk.  The Republican senator wrote in an op-ed in Tuesday’s Wall Street Journal that “over the past year my faith in the Fed has been deeply shaken by its political approach to digital assets in my home state.”  She explained that Wyoming created a heavily regulated bank structure called a special purpose depository institution, or SPDI, in 2019, and began discussing with the Fed whether these vehicles could be considered banks and gain access the federal payment system.  But the two Wyoming-based institutions that received SPDI charters in 2020 – crypto exchange Kraken and bank and stablecoin issuer Avanti – have not yet been approved by the Fed, which says it’s still determining whether they qualify as banks.  Lummis says the delay amounts to a legal violation because in 1994 the Congress required the Fed to act on all bank applications within a year.  The senator wrote that, as a result, she’s “deeply concerned” about Powell and Brainard’s nominations, though she called them both “smart and qualified.”  She continued, “But while Mr. Powell and Ms. Brainard have said they want to promote responsible financial innovation, when Wyoming provided a perfect opportunity the Fed instead inexplicably chose to ignore its legal obligations. I want to know why but haven’t received an answer.”  Read more: Sen.

42421203,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgrW9,1638388593,Tim Draper on Bitcoin and the Collapse of Fiat,"Timothy Draper, the billionaire venture capitalist and early advocate for bitcoin, thinks crypto is ushering in a new age of peace. And the future of the world economy is irrefutably linked to blockchain-based technology, he said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Tuesday.  “I actually believe that we are moving toward a decentralized world. We’re moving toward a world that is more open and global,” the founder and managing director of Draper Associates said in a live interview. “It’s going to be awesome.”  This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.  The rise of borderless currencies like bitcoin, which are open technological standards that anyone can use, will create jobs and improve living standards for a great number of people, Draper said. It also sets the stage for a world where centralized governments are irrelevant.  “The fact that [bitcoin] is so frictionless means that the entire world will become wealthier because, as we all know, the more friction in our currency, the less wealth in a society,” he said.  What Draper calls “frictionless” sounds a lot like an accelerant to the neoliberal reforms of the past 50-odd years. Neoliberalism is a political philosophy born out of the ideas of economists including Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek, who advocated for the deregulation and globalization of markets.  Discussing trade wars and stringent immigration policies, Draper said the U.S. empire was voicing the “last roar of the dying lion,” and was making a final claim to “relevance” on the world stage. “The rest of the world is saying, ‘Hey, look, we got global trade. We’re gonna go wherever we feel that there’s enough freedom and trust.’”  Crypto may be inevitable, but the innovation doesn’t necessarily have to occur within U.S. borders. To that end, the billionaire scion advocates for a light-touch regulatory approach to the industry. He draws a comparison to the early internet: If the web was regulated at its start, “we would have lost all that economic value [and] all those jobs.”  “All these governments ... want to keep everything under control, then they regulate, but then they lose all their entrepreneurs,” he said. “They do it at their own peril.”  Also part of Future of Money Week:  The Transhumanist Case for Crypto – Daniel Kuhn  Shiba Inu: Memes Are the Future of Money- David Z.

He also twice won U.S. Marshals auctions of confiscated bitcoin, which he used in part to invest in the industry. His for-profit college for entrepreneurs, the Draper University of Heroes, has long accepted bitcoin payments.  Draper says he first intuited the geopolitical significance of bitcoin after the collapse of Mt. Gox in 2013, the largest cryptocurrency exchange at the time. He lost money but gained respect in the market failure. Now, he expects all other currencies but bitcoin to collapse.  “These governments are trained to print more money to be more relevant. Well we all know that as soon as I can buy my food, clothing and shelter in bitcoin, I’m not going to want to hold – and neither will anyone else – any cryptocurrency or currency that’s tied to any fiat political force,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | SHIB,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/01/tim-draper-on-bitcoin-and-the-collapse-of-fiat,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/40ab2163aa5190dc164fff84f07e51103abe503a-1944x1228.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396414,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT3Fe3,1638386262,"SAND, MANA Tokens Surged in November as Crypto Traders Bet on ‘Metaverse’ Potential","Virtual worlds are invading the world of virtual currencies.  Hype over the untapped value of the “metaverse” sent tokens such as Sandbox’s SAND, Decentraland’s MANA and others to all-time highs in November amid surging interest from cryptocurrency traders and Wall Street alike.  The metaverse is a digital world combining elements of augmented and virtual reality, the internet, gaming, art, culture and social networking. Participating in these worlds usually requires a user to use cryptocurrency tokens or purchase objects in the virtual world, which are typically sold as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  The price rallies followed Facebook’s announcement in October that it would rebrand as Meta, with a new mission that aims to “bring the metaverse to life.”  Facebook’s announcement spawned interest from corporations, real estate investors, venture capitalists and even nations as they raced to claim their stake in crypto’s hottest new frontier.  The Sandbox, an Ethereum-based virtual gaming platform, saw its SAND token jump from $1.55 to $6.79 in November, an increase of about 350%.  SAND spiked after sportswear retailer Adidas tweeted about building an “adiVerse” in The Sandbox’s virtual world.  Competing metaverse project Decentraland’s MANA token rose from $2.81 to $4.67 during the month, a gain of 66%, according to data provider Messari.  Decentraland made headlines in November when the nation of Barbados said it was preparing to establish a virtual embassy in Decentraland’s metaverse, bridging the worlds of international diplomacy and digital real estate.  As of Wednesday morning, Decentraland’s MANA and The Sandbox’s SAND tokens ranked as the 40th and 41st largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, respectively, according to data from CoinGecko.  Crypto traders and even Wall Street analysts are speculating on the metaverse’s untapped commercial value, with some industry officials touting its potential to revolutionize both digital and in-person experiences.  Metaverse a $1 trillion opportunity?  The metaverse “can fundamentally change the medium through which we socialize with others, watch music performances, engage with fashion brands, learn and/or speculate on digital assets such as NFTs or in-game skins,” Morgan Stanley wrote in a Nov. 11 report.  Digital-asset manager Grayscale said the metaverse economy could rake in over $1 trillion in annual revenue. (Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.)  Another report by Bank of America quoting Bloomberg Intelligence said the metaverse could be a $800 billion market opportunity by 2024.  Uncertainty over which tokens will eventually win out has some investors hedging their bets by buying a handful of metaverse projects.  Somnium Space, another Ethereum-based virtual reality world, saw its CUBE token rise 66% during the month.  Loopring price  Loopring’s LRC token increased 189% after rumors swirled over a metaverse-related partnership with video game retailer GameStop.  Additionally, role-playing adventure game Illuvium’s ILV token and art-focused virtual reality project Wilder World’s WILD token jumped 84% and 67%, respectively.  “There are several popular metaverses that stand out and Metaverse Group owns NFT-based land parcels in several of them,” Token.com co-founder and CEO Andrew Kiguel told CoinDesk. Metaverse Group, a subsidiary of Tokens.com, is a real estate investment firm that focuses exclusively on metaverse properties and boasts the first-ever metaverse real estate investment trust.  The group paid 618,000 MANA tokens (about $2.4 million) for a plot of land in Decentraland last week, setting the record for the largest ever land acquisition in any metaverse.  “Our investment returns will be based on the appreciation of the land we hold and also our ability to develop our land and rent it out to interested groups that want to establish a presence in the metaverse,” Kiguel said.  Despite the fragmented metaverse landscape in its nascent stages, investors are betting that more institutional players will follow Adidas and Barbados.  “Investors should not mistake the lack of one cohesive metaverse with the absence of any metaverses,” Morgan Stanley warned.",POSITIVE,MANA | SAND,BUSINESS | FIAT | MANA | MARKET | SAND,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/01/sand-mana-tokens-surged-in-november-as-crypto-traders-bet-on-metaverse-potential,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4dcbd5fc34fded91e9c59476a4ea8c803f90a4e0-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This is despite the recent sell-off triggered by fresh fud from the new Omicron COVID variant. The &apos;open interest&apos; is an indicator that measures the amount of Bitcoin derivative contracts open at the end of a trading day. High values of the metric can mean there is excessive leverage in the market. This could lead to higher volatility in the price of the cryptocurrency. On the other hand, low values of the open interest may lead to lesser volatility as there isn&apos;t much leverage in the market.

42417099,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS4oQf,1638382889,Money for Everything: A Future Where Every Inch of Culture Is Monetized,"One of the things cryptocurrencies do extremely well – for better or worse – is ascribe monetary value to things we didn’t previously understand as being “worth money.”  NFTs (non-fungible tokens), it’s often said, are a way of assigning property rights to media files. Before NFTs, if you downloaded an album as a set of MP3s and sent them to a friend, your friend would have the exact same copy of the album. Not so in the NFT era, where there’s only one real copy of the album: the token, verified on a blockchain. The music would still be available to share (at least in theory), but only a lucky few will actually hold the token.  It’s a new paradigm for ownership on the internet – one that’s already generated a huge amount of money for crypto companies and early adopters. But it also only works if people start to accept that provenance on the blockchain (i.e., the transparent chain of ownership you can scroll through on “block explorer” websites) actually amounts to property rights. That’s not exactly clear-cut because tokens aren’t legal contracts. They offer no intellectual property (IP) ownership or rights.  This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.  In the crypto community, it’s a no-brainer that this digital paper trail amounts to a new form of “real” ownership. But if we accept that idea, we accept that the logic of digital markets will come to infiltrate the way we already live our lives online. Using the so-called “platform internet” isn’t always an investment, in an explicit monetary sense. Crypto can turn some of those passive efforts – scrolling, exploring, socializing – into financial transactions. What would it mean to live in a world where every single image, song, health record, Twitter “like” and blog post has a discrete token attached?  “Everyone’s already a creator,” said Li Jin, a general partner at Variant Fund and an ex-partner at Andreessen Horowitz. “We’re all creating content on the internet. I think this binary divide between who’s a creator versus who’s a consumer – it doesn’t really exist. Everyone is creating something of value on the internet.”  For Jin, that includes the users who write comments and share posts, along with the people who actually make content. Everyone interacting with this online social mesh is already playing a role in creating value, whether they realize it or not; crypto just affixes a dollar sign to existing behaviors. Things don’t “go viral” without a massive network of individual interactions. In a tokenized future, an early “like” on a post that eventually becomes popular could be a kind of historical artifact; trading it on the secondary market might prove lucrative. Same goes for a highly rated comment, in a comment section.  “I think crypto has this ability to blur the lines between who’s a creator versus who’s not a creator because it enables all that value to be rewarded and measured,” Jin explained.  Right now, the expectation is that consumers will put time and energy into social media platforms for free, simply because it’s fun. Influencers can leverage followers for corporate sponsorships, and celebrities can use social media as ad space (people are definitely making money on platforms like Instagram) but the fundamental experience of scrolling and interacting isn’t always “rewarded” in the same way. Ironically, there’s an almost Marxist twist to Jin’s thinking: consumers create value for platforms, but don’t always get something in return.  Read more: The Future of Money: 20 Predictions  The other side of that idea – that everyone’s a creator – is that everyone’s also an investor. Time and energy are investments, even if they’re not always monetized. With an explicit financial layer in the form of tokens, users get a material stake in the platforms they use the most.  The recent ENS airdrop is a good example of how this could work, if more companies come to adopt these ideas. ENS is the Ethereum Name Service, a company that offers customizable replacements for unwieldy crypto addresses. Rather than typing out all 64 characters every time you want to interact with someone’s wallet, you can just use something like “vitalik.eth.” They cost about $150, including gas fees. But anyone who bought one before Oct. 31 of this year was also entitled to claim a certain number of $ENS tokens, which have proven valuable on the secondary market. Even buying a single domain could have netted you tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of $ENS tokens when the airdrop hit in early November.  To some users, it felt like getting free money. But it could also be thought of as a form of compensation for believing in a project early on – an investment of time and energy that was eventually sublimated into tokens. Everything you do “on chain” can be framed as an investment with the possibility of direct monetary rewards down the line. In a fully tokenized future, everyone is a venture capitalist.  “We’re all people who exist in a capitalist society,” said Jin. “On the internet, all the actions that we’re taking on all these platforms are already financialized – our likes have value, our retweets have value, the content that we put out there has value. But today, that value does not accrue to the individual user. Tokenizing our work and our actions allows that value to accrue back to the individual creators.”  Axie Infinity, a program that bills itself as a kind of crypto-backed video game, has pushed this idea to an extreme. To start playing, you first need to buy three Axie NFTs on the secondary market; right now, the cheapest ones are going for about $100, not including fees. Players can then farm and sell in-game items to make real-world money. In its current form, it more closely resembles a gamified investment platform or slot machine than a traditional online game.  “Traditionally, gamers are used to dealing with systems where people are chasing power, respect and a sense of belonging,” said Jeff Zirlin, a co-founder of Axie Infinity. “These are forms of currencies and value, too. All we’ve done is we’ve added real value into the mix.”  The problem is that when everything becomes money, it can be hard to think about anything else. Across the world, but especially in the Philippines, people have turned Axie Infinity into a full-time job. Getting paid to play video games isn’t exactly a novelty; streamers and Gen Z media collectives have already found ways to monetize gaming through Twitch, YouTube and other platforms. But what happens to the experience of playing the game, when there’s a real ante up front? At what point does fun become work?  “Just where people could not have imagined, like, driving Uber or being an Airbnb host, this is the creation of a new type of work,” said Zirlin.  Also part of Future of Money Week:  The Future of Money: A History - Dan Jeffries  Who Sets the Rules of Bitcoin as Nation-States and Corps Roll In - David Z. Morris  The World Bitcoin Will Build - Cory Klippsten  With investment from Andreessen Horowitz and Mark Cuban, Axie Infinity is the most successful example of a “play-to-earn” model that’s become increasingly popular over the past few years. And while blue-chip VC backing is far from a surefire path to world domination, the success of play-to-earn portends a future where fun and finance are increasingly intermingled.  “All we’ve done is we’ve added a system of property rights into games,” Zirlin explained. “So, in some ways, we’ve freed people. We’ve given them something that they should have had all along.”  Of course, Zirlin and his team didn’t just build Axie for fun; the house can still win when players lose. Axie Infinity doesn’t guarantee anyone money. And it’s not as if Uber drivers – to borrow Zirlin’s analog – are any more economically liberated than other gig workers.  In Venezuela, players who can’t afford the buy-in turn to community-driven Axie “scholarships,” which are really more like unbacked NFT loans. There’s a nascent cottage industry of Axie loan operations looking for “scholars” on Discord and Telegram. Axie Revolution, a “scholarship” program with around 40,000 Twitter followers, says it fronts the buy-in in exchange for 35% of future earnings, but most popular programs take much more. According to the data aggregator CoinGecko, some ask for as much as 50%.  And per a recent report from the research firm Naavik, the majority of Fillipino Axie players are still making under the country’s average daily wage.  “It’ll be interesting to consider what happens to all of these activities that we used to do for free, that we thought we were doing just for fun but now we realize we can make money from them,” said Jin, whose firm Atelier Ventures has invested in other play-to-earn platforms.  Gray-market systems like Axie “scholarships” are inevitable in the realm of financialized gaming. And some creators and artists remain vehemently opposed to participating in crypto at all, for exactly this reason – the idea that crypto only replicates existing systems.  “I think that the financialization around the NFT space needs some heavy auditing before it’s an actually fair market for the artists themselves, and that the art is being purchased for the merit of what it expresses rather than what profit it could yield in the future,” the musician Zola Jesus told Pitchfork. “I don’t want people to bet on me like a racehorse.”  To that, crypto believers would probably say that capitalism’s relentless churn is already betting on us all.  “Individual creators have the option of either tokenizing their work or not – if people feel uncomfortable with that, they can continue carrying on with their current behaviors,” Jin said. “But even though it’s not explicit today, there is already this implicit financialization of your work.”  Also part of Future of Money Week  Money at the Speed of Thought: How ‘Fast Money’ Will Shape the Future - David Z.

42396427,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT3Fqq,1638381613,Polygon’s MATIC Token Jumps After 21Shares ETP Listing,"“Layer 2″ blockchain project Polygon’s MATIC token is up 16% in the last 24 hours after crypto exchange-traded product (ETP) issuer 21Shares announced it’s listing a product linked to the cryptocurrency’s performance on Euronext exchanges in Paris and Amsterdam.  Layer 2 products work on top of primary blockchains to speed up transactions. Polygon aims to solve the scalability issues on the Ethereum network, which has suffered from congestion and high fees.  The new listings for the 21Shares ETP, which the company says is Europe’s first product linked to MATIC’s performance, comes after it was unveiled on the SIX Swiss Exchange last month.  At press time, Polygon’s native token, MATIC, was trading at around $2.05. It’s still well off its all-time high of $3 reached in May, based on prices reported by the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.  Ethereum Gas Fees  More than 3,000 apps are now on Polygon, according to a report from blockchain development platform Alchemy.  “I’m very bullish because of the sheer number of NFT (non-fungible token) and gaming projects built on Polygon,” said Alexandre Lores, an analyst at Quantum Economics.  In July, Polygon launched a $100 million fund for projects aimed at combining blockchain technology with gaming.  “This made Polygon a step ahead of the rest of crypto in gaming,” Lores said.  Because of the high fees on Ethereum – also known as gas – it doesn’t make sense to build a video game on the blockchain, Lores said.  Lucas Outumuro, head of research at blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, said that the 21Shares ETP listing might bring more inflows to Polygon. However, he noted, “It’s more likely that the market is repricing layer 2s as we saw with Immutable X (IMX) in the past few weeks.”  Dennis Hui, a DeFi (decentralized finance) portfolio manager at DAO Ventures, said that the price pop for MATIC might just reflect a bull market in cryptocurrencies.  “This is a bull market, a bull market that is looking for an excuse to rally, and that’s all there is to it,” Hui said. ”A week ago, we were in love with metaverses. A quarter ago, it was layer 1s.” Layer 1 refers to primary blockchains, including Avalanche, Cardano, Ethereum, Polkadot and Solana.  Also up on the day are Terra’s LUNA, which rose 10% to $63.50 at press time. Solana (SOL) is up 7% in the last 24 hours, and Crypto.com (CRO) is up 8%.",POSITIVE,MATIC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MATIC | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/01/polygons-matic-token-jumps-after-21shares-etp-listing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e19162629a78dafaf0633e5d63830bd74859f70-8164x6123.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Wright Civil Suit Says It ‘Cannot Come to a Decision’,"MIAMI — During its fourth week in the courtroom and fourth day of deliberations, a federal jury in the case of Kleiman v. Wright today said jurors could not agree on a verdict.  “Unfortunately, we cannot come to a conclusion and we cannot all agree on a verdict on any of the questions,” they wrote in a note passed to Judge Beth Bloom at 10:47 a.m. ET.  After some discussions between the judge and opposing attorneys, Bloom decided the situation merited a reading of Florida’s “Allen Charge” for a deadlocked jury.  Bloom called the jurors into the courtroom and read them specific language explaining that “the trial has been expensive in time, effort, money and emotional strain for both plaintiff and defendant. If you fail to agree on a verdict, the case remains open and may have to be tried again … There is no reason to believe either side could try it better or more exhaustively.”  She told jurors they could take all the time they need. She then sent them back to continue deliberating. A mistrial could be declared if they continue to insist they cannot agree on a verdict.  In the hallway of the courthouse, defense attorney Andres Rivero said, “It isn’t over ‘til it’s over.”  Defense attorney Jorge A. Mestre added, “They’re seeing the merit in our case.”  Read more: Kleiman v.

The funding will help AAGV launch its P2E platform supporting external gaming guilds, as well as a new learn-to-earn platform that AAGV says is the first of its kind.  HashKey Capital, Republic Realm and Sancor Capital were among the other backers in the crowded round. Participating angel investors included Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal and David Wang of SoftBank’s Latin America fund. Backers from the gaming industry included Vulcan Forged and Sipher.  Founded four months ago in Singapore, AAGV launched the P2E gaming guild Achip & Achair Guild (AAG) that the company says has attracted 2,000 players, or “scholars,” in the Philippines and six other developing countries.  AAGV now plans to launch a platform that helps other P2E guilds engage players at scale, and a learn-to-earn platform where players earn crypto while learning transferable skills such as math or programming. The company plans to launch beta versions of both platforms during the first half of 2022. AAGV aims to onboard 100 million people onto the metaverse economy by 2030.  “We think the best chance for us to get to 100 million scholars is by cooperating and enabling other guilds rather than competing with them,” said AAGV co-founder and CEO Jack Vinijtrongjit. “We imagine that in five to 10 years that there are 10,000 guilds with at least 10,000 players each and a software platform will be foundational to that happening.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MATIC | TECHNOLOGY,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/01/aag-ventures-raises-125m-to-launch-new-learn-to-earn-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e84cc99312b138fe7835259601aa33459f79ee8-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The funding included a seed round led by Polychain Capital and proceeds from a sale of Structure’s STXR token.  The funds will help Structure develop a mobile app as it looks to become a mainstream gateway to the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Observers have placed 2022 as a potential banner year for fintech–DeFi mashups as crypto familiarity ticks upward in the general population.  Launched earlier this year, Structure plans to let users make zero-commission investments in tokenized stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), options and cryptocurrencies, the company said in a statement. Clients will also be able to trade between assets within a single transaction and receive payments in their choice of tokens. The platform will eventually allow clients to earn, borrow and lend.  “We believe strongly that the promise of DeFi is not reserved for the few and we look forward to helping the team at Structure to bridge that gap,” Polychain CEO Olaf Carlson-Wee said in a statement.  “The history of financial innovation has been a history of a few very savvy, usually well-educated and wealthy people taking advantage of new developments that make them fantastically rich. DeFi has been no exception to this. Structure’s mission is to make all of this new financial growth as inclusive as possible by developing a platform that anybody can use, that doesn’t require any kind of special education in the industry,” Structure co-founder said Bryan Hernandez told CoinDesk.  Structure plans to offer the Structure app on an invitation-only basis in early 2022 with a broader introduction to follow within a few months. Hernandez says the app will initially be available to global investors outside the U.S. to comply with applicable regulations.

Between late October and Nov. 28, the “Dogecoin Killer” meme token lost about half of its value in dollar terms. Then it surged more than 30% as the Kraken exchange announced it would list the token. Then, starting early this morning, it crashed again by about 20%.  Volatility has been a notorious feature of most cryptocurrencies, of course – they’re speculative investments so they swing on sentiment, much like Tesla and GameStop and Rivian stock. SHIB is distinct in that it’s explicitly a “meme token”: It declares pretty much up front that it has no unique utility and depends on attracting a “community” of holders for its value. I don’t think it would be unfair to describe SHIB as a “decentralized Ponzi scheme.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. See CoinDesk’s other “Future of Money Week” coverage here.  Parts of that also applies to the likes of bitcoin or ether but meme tokens lack the underlying technological advantages of top cryptos – bitcoin’s hardness, ether’s use in smart contracts run on the Ethereum blockchain – or even the innovation in so-called altcoins like Decred’s governance experiments over the years. Shiba inu’s spiritual forebear, dogecoin, was in fact created to more or less make fun of the idea that crypto was actually an “innovation.” One of its co-creators has become an extremely salty crypto critic.  But instead of standing as a performance-art critique, DOGE ended up presaging a wild new species of free-market speculation. It was the first meme token, and during its early days circa 2013-2015 it test-drove the lighthearted community shenanigans that have become an inescapable bizarro element of 21st century capital markets. Just like the GameStop crowd nearly a decade later, DOGE holders organized through message boards like Reddit and engaged in eye-catching stunts such as sponsoring a NASCAR team and the Jamaican bobsledders.  The DOGE community is not as prominent these days, but those early memes have helped the currency stay in or near the top ten of all cryptos. As developers put their blood, sweat and tears into technological innovators like Ethereum, and more recently Solana and Avalanche, DOGE just kept derping along, changing barely at all, coasting on Good Vibes.  And it worked! Which makes it all the more emotionally complicated to watch something like shiba inu skyrocket in value over the past few months. It is arguably an even purer distillation of the memecoin ethos of uselessness than dogecoin. DOGE at least has its own blockchain, while shiba inu is just an ERC-20 token on Ethereum. It offers no defensible market or technology “moat.” It seems to have benefited substantially from unit bias as new entrants came to crypto and bought the token just because it was “cheap.” Its presence among the most valuable cryptos on some indexes is thanks to a perhaps misleading “market cap” metric. And its supply cap of 4 trillion coins, even if it were reliably enforceable, means there’s very little long-term scarcity.  And yet there it is, trading with the big boys. The one thing you can’t do in response is become a meme yourself, gritting your teeth and growling about how “SHIB offers no technological innovation and should be worth zero aaaargh!”  By getting mad at SHIB, you’re implicitly buying into the Efficient Markets Theory, or EMT. EMT is (loosely) the “invisible hand” you learned about in your high school economics class, the idea that supply and demand magically converge on a “correct” price. When it comes to assets, EMT assumes that investors, collectively, have access to all relevant information about an asset and reach a price based strictly on that information.  But boy oh boy, is that idea deader than a doornail.  I’ve recently been digging into a true investing classic, “The Money Game.” Published in 1968, it was in retrospect one of the earliest rebuttals of EMT, après la lettre. It was considered so scandalous, both for its gossip and its principles, that author George Goodman, a working Wall Streeter, felt compelled to publish under the pen name “Adam Smith.” It was a snarky choice, because Goodman set out to undermine, or at least dramatically question, the mechanistic and mathematical worldview that the original Adam Smith developed. And Goodman had some profoundly sage advice that applies to those questioning the rise of SHIB today:  “Successful investors I know do not hold to the way it ought to be, they simply go with what is.”  Or, translated to modern terms: lol, u mad bro?  Now don’t get me wrong here – if an economic slowdown hits at the wrong time, the SHIB Army is going to get routed like Napoleon invading Russia in winter. Even in a minor crypto-market downturn, we saw it sink dramatically. So if the real economy tanks and people decide they need to cash in their SHIB to pay the bills, it’s bye-bye. There is no “buy the dip” or long-term growth flywheel for meme tokens. They’re very much a game of musical chairs; if you’re standing when the music stops, ouch.  However, if excitement and community around SHIB remain high long enough, all that logic and reason is out the window. For one thing, in the 21st century, memes have a habit of reshaping reality. Take GameStop, a failing mall retailer that is in the process of leveraging its Reddit popularity to substantially restructure its business. SHIB already has at least a few interesting projects and expansions, such as the Shibaswap “Decentralized Exchange” (I’m using scare quotes because I frankly have no idea if it’s a real DEX).  And here’s where we circle back around to the volatility of crypto as a whole. Bitcoin was itself for a long time just as volatile as SHIB. It still is sometimes! Good, solid ideas are memes too, after all, and they take time to spread and suffer setbacks. Volatility in speculative assets is one index of how a new idea spreads through markets. Or, in the case of SHIB, a new joke. In the medium term, there’s maybe not much difference.  This dynamic isn’t particularly a good thing, but its root cause isn’t meme tokens, it’s the broader overheated asset market, which is a function, at least in part, of the slam-bang U.S. economic recovery. The implicit long leverage in the valuations of companies like Tesla – which is in the S&P 500! – would melt under the hot lights of a genuine downturn, probably not much more slowly than SHIB. There is still a serious difference between speculative bets like GameStop and SHIB and more established assets with clear theses, like Ethereum or Pfizer.  But we live in a world where that line is more permeable than ever. Dreams and memes can evaporate in a light breeze, but given enough time and enthusiasm they can also become reality. And if it’s a crypto, the Real Thing that a meme becomes is simple: It becomes money.

The fund is a sequel to the company’s $120 million fund announced last December.  While the South Korea-based company did not disclose investors, it said the raise included investment from “the largest Korean IT companies, multi-discipline conglomerates and globally renowned investment firms,” according to a press release.  Hashed has been an active investor in the Web 3 gaming space dating back to 2016, hitting big on projects like Axie Infinity and The Sandbox. The firm was also an early investor in the Terra blockchain, whose native LUNA token has surged to all-time highs in recent weeks.  Hashed’s Baek Kim told CoinDesk in an interview that he believes the speculatory phase of investment for projects like The Sandbox is now over, and what institutional firms are now backing is longer-term, more consistent growth in the Web 3 sector.  Investors have been quick to pour money into metaverse development, particularly for gaming-related ventures. FTX, Lightspeed and Solana Ventures announced a $100 million fund to grow Web 3 gaming on Solana in November.  “Just a few years ago, people doubted whether we would be able to transition our offline experience to online, but now people no longer question the value of digital assets such as NFTs and related products to be used in the metaverse,” Hashed managing partner and CEO Simon Kim said in a press release. “This change in our perception indicates that we have been right.”  With news of the new fund, Kim and fellow longtime Hashed member Sean Hong have been promoted to partners of the firm.

42417105,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS4pGH,1638373838,Stablecoins’ Tenuous Relationships With Banks,"As regulators increase their attention on stablecoins, the stage is set for traditional banks to become all the more central to stablecoins’ adoption.  Stablecoins have thus far served as an elegant solution for the cryptosphere. They provide a checking account-like asset enabling traders to get in and out of positions without having to go off chain. Bank deposits don’t live on a blockchain – for now – and are thus an ineffective payment medium for this purpose.  This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.  Yet, no matter the level of financial innovation and all the cryptosphere’s talk of disrupting the traditional financial system, all roads always lead back to the banking system. In stablecoins’ case, it’s with their reserves and their attempts to establish a reputation.  As stablecoins’ reserves come under increasing scrutiny, stablecoin issuers have emphasized their deposits in banks. Many – such as Pax dollar and Binance USD – describe how their coins are backed by fiat deposits in “FDIC-insured banks.” Never mind that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. doesn’t insure banks; it insures some deposits, and only up to $250,000 – well below the billions of dollars’ worth of issued USDP and BUSD. Gemini Dollar goes as far as to suggest its holders can get “pass-through” FDIC insurance – that is, per-user FDIC insurance up to $250,000. They can’t. When news broke that Circle’s USD coin had strayed from its claim of being fully backed by dollars “in a bank account,” it quickly announced a shift back to safe assets.  Moreover, these banks aren’t typically household names like Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan, but rather are small banks that have taken on a crypto-friendly identity. Several stablecoins bank with Signature Bank, while the Facebook-turned-Meta’s libra-turned-diem has partnered with Silvergate Bank ahead of its rollout.  Stablecoins aren’t money market funds  The biggest stablecoins’ banking relationships seem to be the most tenuous. Tether, the stablecoin industry leader, holds about 10% of its reserves in “cash and bank deposits” as of its last reviewed attestation. We know little about these banking relationships other than that they include a large deposit at a shrinking Bahamian bank. We know even less about the industry’s silver standard – USD coin. USDC holds 100% of its reserves in what it calls “cash and cash equivalents.” But that is a black box of bank deposits and “highly liquid” investments that mature in 90 days or less. Regardless, it’s clear these holdings are satisfactory for crypto traders’ use cases.  Yet, despite the resemblance of stablecoins’ portfolios to the assets held in the $5 trillion U.S. money market fund (MMF) industry, we shouldn’t necessarily expect stablecoins to perform the same when a crisis comes. MMFs have one thing stablecoins don’t: strong banking relationships.  When the Federal Reserve rescued MMFs in 2008 and 2020, it used U.S. banks and their dealers as intermediaries. As it stands, however, no one on Wall Street has really seen these larger stablecoin players. Tether holds upward of $30 billion of commercial paper in its portfolio, but none of the small group of Street commercial paper dealers has seen it (it’s had to source these assets abroad), and it’s struggled to form any meaningful domestic banking relationship.  And it’s not clear these banking relationships can be quickly formed, even just for assisting in a crisis. An intermediary bank would typically have to attest that the end borrower met the Fed’s terms for lending – which typically include being solvent, being U.S. domiciled, having pledge-able and eligible collateral and more.  Even in the cases of stablecoins that do have U.S. banking relationships, it’s not clear these small banks can quickly perform these functions typically performed by big Street banks. To wit, the Fed’s rescue of MMFs in 2008, in its role as “lender of last resort,” occurred after banks already stepped in on their own.

Moreover, banks could use the Fed’s rescue programs to support their own sponsored MMFs – which makes for a quick hurdling of the operational obstacles to a rescue. Stablecoins don’t have recourse to a large bank’s balance sheet or access to large bank’s services and on-lending of Fed assistance in crisis.  For as much as stablecoins market themselves as a nonbank solution, and for as much as they’ve pushed back on the suggestion of bank-like regulation, they still need banks. Their narrative that innovation can occur only outside of the regulated banking sector lacks explanation or historical support.  It therefore stands to reason that stablecoins will likely be subsumed by banks – if not by regulation, then sooner or later by market forces.

The staggered rollout comes more than a month after FTX.US’s largely underwhelming Solana-based NFT debut. Company officials who bet that the speed and low cost of the Solana blockchain could best Ethereum, where most blue-chip NFT projects live, were “disappointed” by low user uptake, a source at FTX.US told CoinDesk.  Exchanges race to NFTs  By adding Ethereum NFTs, FTX.US is looking to make up for lost time. It’s undercutting rival NFT exchanges on fee structure (2% compared with OpenSea’s 2.5%) and subsidizing withdrawal fees in a bid to woo users who may be spooked by sky-high Ethereum gas fees.  Another big difference is on the custodial front. Harrison said FTX.US will take custody of listed Ethereum NFTs, which he said will save users money. OpenSea leaves owners in control of their assets until sale.  “By not requiring gas for doing things like bids, we’re going to see a lot more price action and price discovery on the platform, and we hope that in general attracts liquidity,” he said.  Read more: Coinbase Follows FTX.US Into NFT Trading  Users might eventually use non-custodial wallets like MetaMask for Ethereum and Phantom for Solana to interact with FTX.US NFTs, Harrison said. He said there’s more value in embracing accessibility first.  OpenSea, where anyone with a wallet can list any NFT they like, will retain an advantage on breadth.

This follows a joint statement from the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on Nov. 23 that outlined a “policy-sprint” to develop rules for firms offering services in the crypto space.  It was already known that regulators were working on this framework, the report says, but their “sense of urgency” on the matter is a positive for getting new rules in place “sooner rather than later.”  “Well-crafted regulation will help to promote the adoption of crypto assets and their related services,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. That is positive for crypto banks such as Silvergate and Signature.  The biggest risk the bank sees is that policymakers move too fast and “implement measures that inadvertently inhibit adoption of cryptocurrencies,” and whilst not its base case, “regulators could still in theory adopt a highly restrictive stance on crypto-related services (or prohibit them altogether) that severely inhibit their growth.”  Services to fall under the scope of this new framework will include “custody; facilitation of customer purchase/sales of crypto assets; loans collateralized by crypto assets; issuance and distribution of stablecoins; and activities involving the holding of crypto assets on banks’ balance sheets,” the note says.  Regulators will also “assess potential capital and liquidity standards for banks to adhere to when providing crypto-related services,” the bank said.

Holders of $WAG tokens will earn different types of rewards through &apos;The Great Steak&apos; - an industry first. High Staking APYs Remain Appealing When users seek to stake their favorite crypt assets, they want to maximize their yield as quickly as possible. At the current industry average of 10.44%, there is a solid reason to explore currencies supporting proof-of-stake. Another option is using staking platforms that provide similar functionality to more currencies, even though that might yield lower earnings. When opting for external providers, those with the highest APY will often win out. Users are compelled to use exchanges, as they can also store their crypto there.

The development of the Play-2-Earn sector has expanded the scope of tokens, which can now be used as avatars or attributes in computer games. In addition, some NFTs can generate good returns through secondary sales. How non-fungible tokens are used today and whether collectible pictures have a future, we will consider the example of Cypherpunks. NFT with history is always more valuable The first NFTs were created back in 2017. It was at this moment that crypto-kitties and crypto-sharks appeared on the market, which was too primitive in their execution and game mechanics. In 2018, the idea of ​​creating Cypherpunks came up. The creators wanted to tell users about crypto encryption in an accessible form. But at that time it was something unusual and difficult for the average man in the street. Now it is a whole industry of cryptocurrency and blockchain with its own history. Today, the original Cypherpunk collection has 30 unique NFTs traded on the OpenSea marketplace.

Binance data tracked by TradingView shows STX has increased over 50% to $3.30 this week, with the price surging 25% in the past 24 hours.  While the reason for the spike is not apparent, some in the investor community cite bitcoin evangelist Jack Dorsey’s decision to step down as the CEO of Twitter as the catalyst for the move. Dorsey remains the CEO of the payments company Square.  The consensus is that the move away from Twitter will allow Dorsey to focus more on his passion for bitcoin and decentralization.  “If I were not at Square or Twitter, I’d be working on bitcoin,” Dorsey said at Bitcoin 2021, a conference held in Miami in June, according to media reports.  In July, Dorsey said Square would launch a platform for developers to create “decentralized finance” projects built on bitcoin. At Twitter, Dorsey spearheaded Bluesky – a project aimed at turning the social media company into a decentralized protocol. According to Platformer’s Casey Newton, Twitter’s new CEO, Parag Agarwal, has been among the executives most focused on cryptocurrencies and central to chasing Dorsey’s dreams.  Co-founded in Princeton University’s computer science department by Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea in 2013, Stacks Network is a layer 1 network that facilitate smart contracts that settle on the Bitcoin blockchain. The STX token acts as a fuel powering smart contracts on the network.  While bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, its blockchain wasn’t developed to enable smart contracts, unlike Ethereum. Thus, Stacks Network brings added value by allowing smart contracts on Bitcoin’s blockchain with the programming language Clarity.  The impending Stacks improvement proposal SIP-012 upgrade to boost scalability and the planned release of the CrashPunks non-fungible tokens collection on Stacks on Dec. 12 may also be powering the STX token higher.  According to the official blog, the SIP-012 upgrade could boost the network capacity by as much as tenfold.  “Given the number of launches and the ongoing growth of the network, this would be a significant win for many Stacks builders,” Stacks Foundation’s Mitchell Cuevas noted. “Stacks core developers have bundled these possible adjustments into SIP-012.”  While STX has decoupled from bitcoin, its bullish momentum may slow if the larger cryptocurrency faces selling pressure. Bitcoin was recently trading unchanged on the week near $57,000.  Bitcoin’s immediate prospects depend on investors’ expectations for the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy tightening. According to Bloomberg, money markets are back to pricing faster unwinding of stimulus in 2022 in the wake of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s hawkish comments during his appearance before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday.  Markets had pushed back Fed rate hike expectations on Monday, pricing a 25 basis point hike in September 2022 versus July 2022 last month.  A faster unwinding of stimulus, if any, may weigh over asset prices, including bitcoin, which is still seen as a risk asset.  “Bitcoin’s correlation with S&P 500 increased amid the general market sell-off, strengthening our hypothesis that more sophisticated investors are currently not looking at bitcoin as a safe-haven asset, but as a risk-on asset,” Arcane Research said in a weekly note published Tuesday.",POSITIVE,STX,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | STX,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/01/stacks-networks-stx-token-jumps-50-while-bitcoin-struggles-amid-seesawing-fed-rate-hike-bets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aff9b9ad69a4f001e26243a6746a01c13c6a3214-2476x1376.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The monitoring system is aimed at government agencies and companies that want to comply with China’s latest crackdown on crypto mining. The software can provide miners’ internet protocol (IP) address, geographical location, network type and connection frequency, and suggest methods of how to dispose of them, Qihoo 360 said.  Last week, Chinese users couldn’t connect to some of the world’s largest mining pools because of “DNS (domain name system) poisoning.” That type of attack means that the pool’s domain names – for example, CoinDesk.com –were directed away from their actual IP addresses, where their servers are.  Qihoo 360 found that 109,000 mining IP addresses were active daily on average in November, mostly in the provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong, the company said. Miners mainly use home broadband, enterprise-dedicated internet connections and data centers, Qihoo 360 said.

The ability to buy Supreme&apos;s digital content through NFTs would be a surefire way to get everyone to know, talk about and want NFTs even more than they do now. But for Supreme, the stakes are higher. NFTs can be a multi-million dollar opportunity for Supreme, creating a secondary market for the company. Sounds far-fetched? Well, it doesn&apos;t have to be. First, a quick briefing on NFTs. NFTs are non-fungible tokens that are pieces of digital content linked to the blockchain. This digital content isn&apos;t limited to digital art and can extend to images of physical objects, video game skins, GIFs, Tweets, virtual real estate and more. NFTs are non-fungible, so unlike fungible assets, like Bitcoin, they are unique and not mutually exchangeable. No two NFTs are the same. Once you own an NFT you are the sole owner. One of the appeals of Supreme has been exclusivity and unparalleled creativity. Everybody wants Supreme&apos;s latest drops, but there are only limited numbers of certain Supreme products. People have waited in line for days to get their hands on Supreme merch.

What was already happening accelerated even further. Per a report from the National Council on Compensation Insurance, before the pandemic, 6% of Americans worked from home.
