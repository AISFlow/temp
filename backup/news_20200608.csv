The company’s subsidiary, eToroX operates a crypto exchange and has eight of its own stablecoins. eToro has offices in the UK, Cyprus, Australia, Israel and the USA.  When eToro first launched in 2007, the mission of the company was to make trading and investing accessible to anyone. The first platform that was created was a Forex trading platform that was easy to navigate, intuitive and visually appealing. The website added stock trading in 2013 to help investors diversify their portfolios.  In 2010, eToro released its OpenBook platform which features their trademarked CopyTraders and, later on, CopyPortfolios. This technology enables new users and beginner investors to copy other successful investors without having to do much research.  In 2014, eToro introduced bitcoin trading through contracts for difference (CFD) for some of its users, and classified it as a stock to help users familiarize themselves with the asset. This meant that users did not actually purchase bitcoin, but were instead betting on its price. More specifically, with these contracts, the seller pays the buyer the difference between the current value of an asset and its value at the time of the contract.  In 2019, eToro expanded its crypto operations to the US and launched a crypto trading platform and wallet in 32 U.S. states. The same year, eToro announced the purchase of smart contract startup Firmo in order to accelerate their tokenized asset offerings, and launched eToroX.  In 2019, eToro reported that they had raised $162 million since their launch, and that it had more 10 million users across 140 countries.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,John Metais,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/etoro,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3386f2d8914ef4b3ab6d0a8146dda00dc1398367-1500x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394577,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwCveb,1591659742,ConsenSys,"Founded in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, ConsenSys is a blockchain company based in Brooklyn, New York, that develops infrastructure and decentralized applications (dapps) for the Ethereum blockchain.  ConsenSys has incubated some of the most-used Ethereum apps, including the popular Chrome extension wallet Metamask, next-generation identity tool uPort, prediction market Gnosis, and Infura, used by hundreds of Ethereum apps for faster infrastructure.  There are five major branches of ConsenSys, each aimed at building the infrastructure of dapps. ConsenSys Labs is an accelerator and venture arm of the company aimed at supporting entrepreneurs and developers in early-stage blockchain projects. ConsenSys Academy is an online end-to-end developer course that helps people get started coding on the blockchain. The job kit provides a variety of resources about the skills needed to become a developer as well as where to get started.  ConsenSys Solutions works with businesses around the world to build, test, and launch blockchain-based solutions for their companies. ConsenSys Diligence is designed to protect the Ethereum ecosystem through security, legal and technical guidance. Finally, ConsenSys organizes a global conference series, Ethereal Summit.  ConsenSys Labs, a $50 million blockchain venture fund, was launched in 2017. Its aim is to help founders in the space by giving them capital and networking opportunities through an accelerator program – all with the goal of creating web3, a decentralized web built on the Ethereum network. At the end of 2018, ConsenSys had more than 50 ventures under its umbrella.  In 2016, ConsenSys partnered with Microsoft in order to build dapps in Microsoft’s Visual Studio programming platform. Together, they created an extension for the platform to allow smart-contract development in the Solidity programming language (which Ethereum is written in) in Microsoft’s Visual Studio programming platform.In December 2018, ConsenSys laid off 13 percent of its staff. At the company’s height that year, ConsenSys employed over 1,000 people. In 2019, it formed a partnership with Hyperledger and launched Codefi, a suite for decentralized finance solutions, but was forced to cut back 90 more staff in April 2020. ConsenSys is reportedly working with Hong Kong Monetary Authority on a cross-border central bank digital currency (CBDC).

42432025,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN95xh,1591657279,ConsenSys Muscles Into Compliance With New Regulatory Product for DeFi,"ConsenSys' new regulatory compliance product will be at hand to analyze transactions in the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) space.      The Ethereum venture studio said the newly launched Codefi Compliance software suite would provide compliance and analytics for exchanges and DeFi projects across a range of different regulatory buckets, such as counter-terrorism financing (CTF) and anti-money laundering (AML).      Focused on the Ethereum ecosystem, the tool can track up to 280,000 different tokens that are based on the protocol – such as those built on the ERC-20 or ERC-721 standard. The idea, according to a press release, is to replace the varied compliance in crypto at the moment, with the more consistent sort found in the traditional payments sector.      Codefi Compliance allows clients to track digital assets, monitor user behaviors as well as watch fund flows, and compile full data analysis. It can also work across multiple jurisdictions, with settings adjustable to take local regulations into consideration.      According to Lex Sokolin, a ConsenSys executive, this is increasingly important as Ethereum becomes the hub for the emerging DeFi space. The number of unique daily wallets on DeFi – a proxy for user numbers – rose nearly 530% in 2019, according to a DappRadar report.      “Providing robust AML/CFT compliance for Ethereum-based digital assets is a keystone step in bringing the institutional financial industry to decentralized finance,"" Sokolin said. ""Codefi Compliance is the next module in our product suite to eliminate complexity and risk in using DeFi, and help any business benefit from using digital assets.”      Codefi Compliance has already been made compatible with ETH 2.0, the upcoming network upgrade that allows Ethereum to scale.      See also: New Layoffs Hit Ethereum Incubator ConsenSys      Of course, this also means ConsenSys is also putting itself in direct competition with the likes of Chainalysis and Elliptic, two data analytics firms that have turned blockchain traceability and analytics into a fast-expanding and lucrative side industry that has attracted multi-million dollar contracts from the U.S. government.

42394581,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwCvtz,1591656500,Cosmos,"Cosmos aims to create what they describe as the “‘Internet of Blockchains”, a network of blockchains able to communicate with each other in a decentralized way.  Cosmos is a network comprised of many independent blockchains, all of which use byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms. Cosmos enables developers to build both permissionless and permissioned blockchains. The network launched with the release of its first blockchain, the Cosmos Hub, in 2019.  In 2017, the Interchain Foundation, a Swiss non-profit that funds open source blockchain projects, contracted for-profit Tendermint, Inc. (which also utilizes the name All Bits, Inc.) to develop and launch the Cosmos software. Tendermint was founded in 2014 by Jae Kwon, who developed his own byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism earlier that year and started the company to develop business opportunities related to the algorithm.  Kwon also co-authored the Cosmos whitepaper, and Tendermint raised $9 million to continue the development of the project through a Series A funding round in March 2019.  Vision  Cosmos is a network made up of many independent blockchains which utilize byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanisms, including Tendermint BFT. Each individual blockchain maintains control of its own governance, but is interoperable with other blockchains in the network. Blockchains that do not utilize BFT algorithms can be connected to the Cosmos network via “adaptor” blockchains. Cosmos was not designed for one particular use case, but to be adaptable to suit many different use cases.  Cosmos has two types of blockchains: Zones and hubs. Zones are regular blockchains, while hubs are blockchains that connect zones with one another. The Cosmos Hub was the first blockchain (and hub) to be launched in the Cosmos ecosystem. It is a public, proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain whose native asset is the atom (ATOM).  Launch and Issuance  Though atom is the native staking token of the Cosmos Hub, it is not the sole asset of the Hub or the entire network. The Cosmos Hub is a “multi-asset” blockchain and other blockchains in the network can have their own native assets.  Atoms enable network users to vote, pay for transaction fees, validate transactions or delegate transaction validation to other users. Atoms are also distributed to transaction validators and delegates as rewards. There is no cap on the total supply of atoms.  The Interchain Foundation conducted a two week initial coin offering (ICO) of the atom token in 2017 and raised more than $16 million. Prior to the sale, the foundation received commitments for individual contributions from “initial donors” that amounted to 5% of its funding goal. It also received “pre-funding” commitments from individuals and commitments from strategic partnerships that amounted to $1,329,472.  After the ICO, one-third of the total number of atoms distributed through the sale was inflated and distributed to the Interchain Foundation, All in Bits, Inc. (also known as Tendermint), initial donors, pre-ICO donors and ICO donors. The Interchain Foundation and All in Bits both received 10% of tokens upon the mining of the genesis block. Initial donors received 5% and pre-ICO donors and ICO donors received 75% collectively.  Network Design and Security  Cosmos emphasizes the importance of interoperability, the ability for blockchains to transact data between each other. The design of the system incorporates three layers, Tendermint: A byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm compatible with any programming language, Cosmos SDK: A tool to simplify building applications, and IBC: The inter-blockchain communication protocol as a basis for exchange between each zone. An SDK is a software development kit; the structure of the kit is divided into fixed standardized modules, or packages.  The Cosmos Hub was the “first” zone to launch, and hosts a native staking token, atom. Atoms enable network users to vote, pay for transaction fees, validate transactions or delegate transaction validation to other users. Atoms are also distributed to transaction validators and delegates as rewards. The Cosmos Hub also incorporates other digital assets and connects zones within the network.  Tokens can be exchanged between zones without the need for liquidity between them because all token transfers are routed through the Cosmos Hub. The Cosmos Hub tracks the amount of tokens held on each zone, and is also intended to insulate zones from other failing zones.  Monetary Policy  There is no cap on the total supply of atoms. Block rewards are issued to validators and delegators for staking atoms, validating transactions or for delegating transaction validation to other users.  The amount of tokens created with each block is dynamic depending on the staking rate in the Cosmos network. The target stake rate is 66% of all tokens. The inflation will fluctuate between an upper bound of 20% and a lower bound of 7%.  If the stake rate is below the target, inflation will increase toward the upper limit of 20%, and more tokens will be distributed as reward. The target inflation rate began at 7% and recalculates each block. There is no limit to the amount of atoms.  Transaction Processing  The first blockchain, or zone, the Cosmos Hub, is powered by the Tendermint BFT consensus algorithm, which is also a proof-of-stake algorithm. Tendermint requires validators to use cryptographic signatures to commit blocks, thereby taking ownership of their validation. Non-validators delegate their staking tokens to any validator to earn a portion of the block rewards and fees.  Within the Cosmos Hub, anyone can stake their atoms and delegate their stake to a validator, but a validator must have hardware that runs specific software to validate blocks. Outside of the Cosmos Hub, the other individual blockchains may have their own governance models.  To move a transaction from one blockchain to another, a proof is posted on the receiving chain. The IBC protocol defines this as an IBCBlockCommitTx. The proof, observable by anyone, states that the sending chain published a packet for the alleged destination. Then the IBCPacketTx allows the blockchain to verifiably prove to anyone the data packet (transaction) has been published by the sender via the proof. These IBC transactions, transactions between “zones,” are carried out through the Cosmos Hub and must be validated on both chains.",NEUTRAL,ATOM,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Annaliese Milano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/cosmos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ad25cf025d14ed288c609b6d6f0628076c96b85b-2451x1631.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432035,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN96Jh,1591652423,"Brave Browser's Affiliate Link Controversy, Explained","No one is easier to criticize than a Boy Scout.      The browser maker Brave, which launched around protecting online privacy, was called out this weekend when users noticed that typing in the name of the leading cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, resulted in an auto-complete that ended in a referral link.      This replicates on an instance of Brave used here at CoinDesk. Automatically adding the tag to the URL creates the appearance that Brave is adding tracking to visits to the exchange's website that were direct, rather than mediated through some kind of referral (such as Brave's in-browser ads).      Monero developer Riccardo Spagni, also known as Fluffypony, captured some of this unease when he tweeted, ""Bro. I don't want my browser touching the URL I type in the address bar.""      First noticed by Yannick Eckl on June 6 and first reported by Decrypt, the browser was sending signals to Binance that a user had been referred by Brave when they had not been. Brave founder Brendan Eich has since acknowledged the mistake and told users the referral language should stop appearing soon.      He wrote on Twitter on June 6:    ""We made a mistake, we're correcting: Brave default autocompletes verbatim 'http://binance.us' in address bar to add an affiliate code. We are a Binance affiliate, we refer users via the opt-in trading widget on the new tab page, but autocomplete should not add any code.""    A Brave spokesperson told CoinDesk the issue is being addressed.      ""We already updated the default for the 'Show Brave suggested sites in autocomplete suggestions' setting to 'off' in Brave's Nightly release channel,"" Brave's Catherine Corre said via email. ""We will uplift this change to our Dev/Beta and Stable channels (version 1.9.80 in Stable) today.""      Eich's tweet thread goes on to explain the mistake reflects the need for the company to run a profitable business. Brave recently reported it has reached 15 million monthly active users, which represents solid growth and one of the most popular pieces of technology in the cryptocurrency space, but it's still minuscule compared to the overall browser market.      Still, Brave's growing share of online attention has enabled the company to negotiate more and more deals as a referral partner. Brave's opening page has frequently been turned over to advertisements recently and it now has a Binance trading widget there. Use of that widget does count as a referral by Brave.      Brave never intended to eliminate advertising completely, but rather to provide a model of advertising where users would receive ads without being followed around the web. In April 2019 it debuted Brave ads, which offered more of a pop-up ad experience where users receive most the Basic Attention Token (BAT) paid to publish ads. (To withdraw the BAT earned, however, a users has to go through an anti-money laundering identity check.)      It would be good to get more clarity on the kind of mistake that was made, though this tweet from Eich seems to suggest Brave knew what it was doing at the time it added the referral code:    ""I never said it was accidental. We were treating it like a search query (which all big browsers do tag with an affiliate id to get paid from by the search provider). But a valid domain name is not a search query. Fixing.""    When asked for comment on the controversy, Binance's communications team redirected CoinDesk to Brave.    Open to scrutiny    Brave does all of its development as open source and posts it on GitHub to be inspected, just like most projects in the crypto space.      This enabled another person on Twitter, Harry Denley to find the autocomplete language in the codebase. What's also noteworthy about Brave's openness, though, is that it also permits others to fork their code. In fact, Brave now runs on a fork of Chromium (the software underlying Google's Chrome, the most widely used browser in the world).      A group going by the name of @BraverBrowser on Twitter is saying that it will release a fork of Brave that strips out BAT functionality and also strips out any advertising.      The new project appears to be lead by Dean van Dugteren, the founder of a project called nOS, which sounds very similar to Brave. Its design includes a browser designed around the usage of crypto apps, with an app store, an exchange and even its own token, NOS.      In the Braver Browser Discord channel, Dugteren says he is only able to work on it in some of his spare time, and he's looking for more contributors.

The Bail Bloc hashrate is currently 94.5 KH/s, according to Earle.      Funds are used to pay bail for those in pre-trial detention, which can last for weeks or even months otherwise. Since 1970 pretrial detentions have increased by 433%, according to research by the Center for American Progress. In 2015, more than 60 percent of the total jail population in the U.S. was made up of people held for pretrial detention, according to a study from the Vera Institute, a nonprofit that campaigns for justice system reform. In the wake of protests against police brutality more than 10,000 protestors have been arrested in the U.S.      See also: Monero Hacker Group 'Outlaw' Is Back and Targeting American Business: Report      Earle originally conceived of Bail Bloc following President Trump’s 2016 election as a way to address clicktivism (where people signal their fidelity to cause without doing anything about it). Monero is a leading privacy-focused coin that hides the identity of miners and Earle said Monero’s mining algorithm has helped Bail Bloc.      “The Random-X mining algorithm helped our project because most of the people running Bail Bloc on their computers are using mid-level consumer laptops without dedicated graphics cards (GPUs),” said Earle. “Now that GPUs and CPUs are on even grounds in terms of hashrate, we are collecting Monero at a much higher rate than before.”      Thus far Bail Bloc has raised over $8,000, or enough to bail out 13 people. Its next check will be going to the Immigrant Bail Fund in Connecticut.      Several bail funds are accepting direct donations in cryptocurrency.      The Bail Project is a national nonprofit that provides free bail assistance to thousands of low-income Americans every year, and accepts donations in bitcoin. Thus far it has secured freedom for over 10,000 people in over 20 cities across the country, working with community partners to advance systemic change.      See also: Minnesota Official Alarms Privacy Advocates With Contact Tracing Comments      “We use the National Revolving Bail Fund to support bailouts in over 20 jurisdictions, and assistance is provided by our teams of full-time Bail Disruptors and Client Advocates, who are community based,” said Bail Project CEO Robin Steinberg. “We started accepting crypto from the beginning, in no small part because [billionaire investor] Mike Novogratz, chairman of our board, is a firm believer in cryptocurrency and encouraged us.”      Pilar Maria Weiss, Director of the Community Justice Exchange, a non-profit, said some bail funds that have more infrastructure accept bitcoin but many protest bail funds are very informal and therefore only use Cash App for Go Fund Me pages. The Cash App does let users pay or donate using bitcoin, however.      All three bail projects recommend taking direct action as well as just donating.      “Get proximate to the problem,” said Steinberg. “Don’t turn a blind eye on injustice. Speak up. Make sure your elected officials know that you will not allow these injustices to continue. Listen to the Black community.

Following an initial round of layoffs in March, all remaining members of the 35-person Tel Aviv-based firm have been laid off.      “The COVID-19 crisis affected us strongly and we had to close down BLOCKTV,” BlockTV COO Noa Tamir told CoinDesk in a LinkedIn message. “We’re very proud with the brand we built and with all the fresh content and news we brought to the Blockchain and Crypto community. Hopefully we'll be able to bring BLOCKTV back to life in the future.”      The news organization was launched in 2019 with backing from controversial crypto entrepreneur Moshe Hogeg. Last November, BlockTV tried to raise $2 million via the sale of its BLTV token on crypto exchange Bittrex, according to The Block. Similar to Brave’s Basic Attention Token (BAT), the token incentivized readers, publishers and journalists to collaborate in revenue sharing, the startup detailed in a blog post.      The token sale did not help the startup during the crisis, however.      “Unfortunately, they were forced to effectively close shop with the coronavirus lockdowns,” said former BlockTV senior analyst and anchor Asher Westropp-Evans. “As with so many, it was hard to keep operations running smoothly under such strenuous conditions.”      See also: $103M Bailout Denied for Coronavirus-Hit Firms in Switzerland’s ‘Crypto Valley’      Having a “skeleton crew” following the March layoffs ultimately did not work out, Westropp-Evans added.      BlockTV initially listed its token for a pre-sale price of $0.01. At press time, data provider CoinGecko listed BLTV at $0.003, down some 70% since November.      It’s not the only crypto media startup to have dabbled in tokenization. Decrypt announced the launch of its own token at EthCC in Paris in early March 2020.      “In the environment of the early COVID-19 days when everything seemed to be in freefall, people weren’t eager to take on additional [investment] into tokens. So that wasn’t going to help a short-term squeeze,” Westropp-Evans said.      Prior to the pandemic, BlockTV had planned on launching a studio in New York City in Q1 2020 to complement its lineup of broadcast-news-style reports. The startup continued to issue content intermittently through the spring months, as seen on its Twitter feed.

Bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $9,706 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), slipping by less than a percent over the previous 24 hours.      At 00:00 UTC on Monday (8:00 p.m. Sunday ET), bitcoin was changing hands ataround $9,760 on spot exchanges including Coinbase. The price has stayed more or less in a range between $9,600 and 9,700, keeping bitcoin above its 50-day and 10-day moving averages, a bullish technical indicator. This sentiment was helped by large volumes of trading Sunday, when prices rallied from below $9,400 to as high as $9,800.      Read More: Returns for Bitcoin’s Forks Have Trounced Bitcoin This Year      On a relatively quiet Monday, many traders continue to view a break above $10,000 as the make-or-break signal on bitcoin's continued strength.      “The market looks calm and the volume in the top-tier spot exchange volume is pretty low,” said Sasha Goldberg, a senior trading specialist for crypto firm Efficient Frontier. “We are close to the $10,000 limit,” he added. “If bitcoin is not able to go above that level and stay there, it’s possible that we’ll see a pullback to the $8,000 level.”      Read More: Bitcoin Remains on Hunt for $10K as Holding Sentiment Gains Strength      Despite the lack of action, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has made very positive gains overall in 2020, said Josh Rager, a cryptocurrency trader and founder of educational platform BlockRoots. “Bitcoin is still near $10,000. Just because it's not pumping, it's still performing well,” he said.      Since the start of 2020, bitcoin has appreciated over 35%, while gold is up 11% and the S&P 500 index of U.S. stocks is flat, back to where it was at the start of the year.      “Friday's incredibly positive U.S. nonfarm payrolls number has led to the largest divergence between Gold and S&P 500 prices since the March lows,” said Singapore-based QCP Capital in an investor note.

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is trading around $242 and is flat, up less than a percent in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

Measured by the ratio of aggregate open interest in the bitcoin options market to open interest for bitcoin futures and swaps, a clear upward trend is observable from January 2020 to date.      A historical trend of a higher ratio signals a rate of growth in options open interest that exceeds growth in that of bitcoin futures and swaps. Open interest is defined as the outstanding contracts, measured here in dollars.      Although the open interest in bitcoin options is growing and is now roughly 35% that of futures and swaps, it still has a long way to go compared to traditional financial markets where options open interest and trading volumes are “generally a multiple of futures,” said Su Zhu, co-founder of cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.      “It makes sense for bitcoin to go a similar route as liquidity improves and institutional players come in,” he added.      Likewise, the dollar value of options trading volume is a tiny fraction of futures even as March saw volumes for bitcoin options and futures hit yearly highs, according to Skew. Aggregate options volume reached $294 million, while futures volume passed $45.5 billion. Options volume was about $220 million in May.      Growth in options trading has been helped by OKEx and CME Group launching bitcoin options in December 2019 and January 2020, respectively. Still, Panama-based exchange Deribit still supports roughly 85% of daily volume, according to Skew.

42432042,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN96Vh,1591644144,What Fintech Can Learn From Elon Musk and SpaceX,"Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.      Elon Musk is complicated. His life is one of extremes – swinging from bankruptcy to massive success, family to playboy, compliance to law breaker, trolling to leadership. Let's pause to admire that and learn. A lesson in human nature, ingenuity and vision. Let's talk about SpaceX.      Musk founded SpaceX in 2002, and it has always been connected to his personal ambition for interplanetary space travel and to put a human settlement on Mars. Imagine the ego and hubris to hold this goal! Imagine the willpower and strength to get it done! The key insight that many others have shared about Musk's personality is he is able to break down any problem to ""first principles"" and reconstruct a modern, unusual answer. From PayPal to Tesla to SpaceX to the Boring Company, each is a new answer to a large fundamental societal need. [Check out this great interview series from Wait But Why on the subject.]      See also: Lex Sokolin - Software Ate the World, Here’s How It Eats Finance      If you haven't been watching, SpaceX just delivered a rocket with astronauts to the International Space Station. This is notable for a number of reasons. First, the public U.S. space program has slowed since the Space Shuttle was decommissioned in 2011, with the Russian Soyuz spacecraft serving as the go-to-vehicle since. Second, SpaceX has already set a number of private company records, including being the first 20 year-old business supplying NASA with its primary space faring capability for the foreseeable future.      As competition with China over global technology heats up, it is also the West's most likely bet for commercial research and development. Space is not a pointless adventure. It is our GPS system (without which there would be no Uber, Lyft or Deliveroo), satellite mapping (without which there would be no Google Maps), and if Musk has his way with Starlink, a space-bound, high-speed internet system. And while China commits billions upon billions of national budget to artificial intelligence, blockchain and other frontier tech infrastructure, the U.S. relies primarily on the capital markets for solutions. Few people in global history have Musk's ability to use capital markets to address issues on the scale of humanity.    Illusion of digital transformation    I want to give you a sense of the meme that has been floating around social media associated with the launch of the rocket. Let's call it – ""Digital Transformation.""      In pictures of the Apollo rocket you see physical buttons and dials. Its 1960s aesthetic is both endearing and overwhelming. There is a crude physicality of piloting this craft, a turning of the gears in a gigantic industrial machine. The Space Shuttle incorporates screens and displays, but the immense manual complexity remains. Finally, we have the SpaceX Dragon. Its controls are distilled into a single, sleek visual display running on a Linux operating system. The computer has three backups, a fourth system running on another OS and a manual override. But here it just looks like a luxury car.      I have seen many people compare this to how neobanks or roboadvisors have re-imagined the financial industry. Instead of some large arcane manual process, there is a slick touch-screen interface that is designed for simplicity and user experience. Instead of using ink and faxes and phones, you just scan your face and connect to the hivemind. Let's put a pin in this comment and move onto the next exhibit.      Compare conceptions of what a space crew should look like. The entirely utilitarian, baggy orange suits of old create a stark contrast to the minimalist, uniform treatment of ""Star Trek."" The SpaceX astronauts above look like race car drivers or science fiction characters, communicating power, speed and futurism. That should come as no surprise, given the concept for the suits was created by a Hollywood costumer designer for the movies ""The Avengers,"" ""X-men II"" and ""Fantastic Four.""      The suits are no less functional than their historic predecessors. But unlike them, they communicate an accessibility to space – and a coolness factor – that was missing in the past. Instead of being foreign and suffocating, space becomes just another road along which the human race will travel.    Or are you involved in hyping up the same old thing with a new interface?    What Musk knows, and what many fintechs naturally understand, is brand and story matters. This is why he shot a Tesla into the sun. To be a troll, to have a sense of humor, to laugh at the absurd tragedy of human nature – these are all a single strand of DNA. How can a person like this not bristle at the Securities and Exchange Commission regulating him on Twitter?      Before moving on, let's appreciate that Musk delivers on his marketing. Unlike most fintech founders, who are still talking about building some Amazon supermarket of finance while Amazon actually builds that supermarket, Musk builds proof that sears his stories and humor into our minds. Who has ever touched Finance with this approach other than perhaps Richard Branson's Virgin Money or Capital One? Who has done the impossible as a contrived joke, only to top that joke year after year? Not Wells Fargo. Not Bank of America. Not Morgan Stanley.      If you can laugh about the existential danger to the human race (i.e., we must move to Mars before we blow up the planet), why can't you laugh about our naive resource allocation mechanisms? Are our financial lives any less absurd?    Escaping innovation theater    Look. Marketing and design are great. But they are not digital transformation. They are the noise attracting monkeys to the banana tree. They are what faceless corporations have to do to empathize with and relate to human customers. They should be symptoms for something much deeper, not just innovation theater of workshops and social media influencer articles (I'm guilty!). Show the underlying change. Show a different way to make the thing. Burn down what you have to make it anew.      This image above is the one that actually matters. This right here is actual digital transformation.      See also: Lex Sokolin - The American Empire Is in Decline. Time for a New Economic System      The cost of delivering payloads has fallen from $20,000 per kilogram with the Space Shuttle program to $2,000 with SpaceX. One of the core innovations is the design of a reusable rocket, which can land on a platform without exploding after its trip into orbit. As a result, the variable cost of each launch has fallen from $500 million to $50 million while delivering the same payload. On the fixed cost side of the equation, SpaceX also outperforms – developing the Falcon rocket for $400 million, with NASA estimating that a similar program funded by the government would have cost $4 billion.      Musk is able to deliver the same result for 90% less upfront cost, and 90% less ongoing cost.      That 90% is deadweight loss. It is a bureaucratic waste of resources that comes with supporting only existing vendors, believing the way things are done is how they should be done and that institutional relationships are more important than innovative solutions. It is the inability to swallow the sunk costs of a 40-year-old core banking system and replace it from scratch. It is the disconnect between a mobile first generation that wants all financial services in simple packaging in real time, and an investment management industry built on complexity to service primarily high-net-worth clients. It is the gap between a government body that protects consumers by creating principle-based rules asking brokers to be fiduciaries, and a quilt of regulators captured by their various sectors focused on enforcing the status quo.    Takeaways for fintech    If you are reading this, chances are you are an entrepreneur, investor or operator in the fintech space. Like all of us, you want to make money from some creative angle or approach to the age old problems of paying, saving, and investing. Maybe you are watching Tink expand its open banking APIs, or Revolut bundle together new features into an app with 12 million users.      My advice is to ask the following question: Is what you are doing able to deliver the same result as our prior system for 90% less upfront cost, and 90% less ongoing cost?      Or are you involved in hyping up the same old thing with a new interface?      I am not throwing shade on Tink and Revolut. Both companies have accomplished a meaningful customer impact, and re-positioned the perception of banking. Yet if we ever want to get out of incrementalist thinking, delivering 20% improvements to financial middleware, we need to think bigger. We need to start with some massive existential human need, and design a solution for the next century with tools made in 2020.      If dozens of other companies are tackling the same problem as you after their $5 million pre-seed round, it's probably not a problem worth your time. Pick something bigger. Do something harder. Breathe in more deeply. For example, it may not be easy to rebuild a global financial system from scratch out of Ethereum, but it’s worth a try.      Not all of us have the experience of Musk's multi-million exits: $20 million from Zip2 in his 20s, $180 million from PayPal in his 30s and billions since. Not all of us have his Icarus-like confidence and self-control. But we can all aim a little bit higher.      Choose to build a functional business instead of making a short-term trade on hot venture trends. Market timing is harder than you think. And just because you work in finance doesn't mean you need to work on financialization. Owning an asset for yield or editing the work of others by trading in the capital markets can be well-compensated activity. It accounts for the wealth of a meaningful percentage of self-made billionaires.      But even more valuable is to be the artist, the builder, the visionary.

42432041,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN96Rh,1591639381,Bitcoin's Forks Have Trounced Bitcoin This Year,"While bitcoin has outperformed gold and the S&P 500 index in 2020, data shows even better returns among leading bitcoin ""fork"" cryptocurrencies.      These cryptocurrencies are created by copying the Bitcoin source code repository through a process called “forking.” Developers then adjust certain parameters and features in the copied code to create a similar but distinct protocol. According to data from Messari, the three largest bitcoin (BTC) forks by market capitalization are bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoin sv (BSV), and bitcoin gold (BTG).      Using an equal-weighted index of the four cryptocurrencies the returns are almost 3.5 times greater than bitcoin alone for the year to date, based on TradingView data. Since the beginning of 2019, moreover, this index outperformed bitcoin by a total of 435 percentage points. An equal-weighted index of just the top three bitcoin forks returned gains 3.1 times greater than bitcoin, year to date.      Individually, bitcoin sv and bitcoin gold have outperformed bitcoin by 61 and 37 percentage points, respectively, since the start of 2020. Bitcoin cash outperformed bitcoin until May. Year to date, the largest bitcoin fork has underperformed bitcoin by 11 percentage points, according to TradingView data.      Some analysts aren’t surprised by these returns. Cryptocurrencies with low and middle market capitalizations like these bitcoin forks “tend to outperform bitcoin during marketwide bull runs,” said Aditya Das, market analyst at research firm Brave New Coin. Similar trends were observed during the 2017 bullish market cycle, he explained. The miner subsidy for bitcoin and its forks also halved this year, an event that occurs once every four years and is a bullish catalyst for some investors.      These returns are mostly attributable to a strong positive correlation with bitcoin’s price inflation combined with higher volatility, according to Louis Liu, founder and CIO at Mimesis Capital. Nonetheless, there is “definitely alpha” in bitcoin forks, he said, referring to the excess returns. However, he says they were not the result of fundamental value added by improving on bitcoin.      As is usually the case, greater returns come with increased risk. Liquidity is one such concern, Das explained.      See also: Bitcoin Remains on Hunt for $10K as Holding Sentiment Gains Strength      Only two of the industry’s largest exchanges by traded volume, Binance and Bitfinex, support markets for all three top bitcoin forks, according to Nomics. Moreover, the largest bitcoin cash spot market, supported by Binance, is only one-tenth the size of the largest bitcoin market, also on Binance.      Forks such as bitcoin cash and bitcoin sv are “likely being used purely as speculative instruments,” said Kevin Kelly, former equity analyst at Bloomberg and co-founder of digital asset research firm Delphi Digital.      What’s more, he added, “the liquidity profile and long-term value proposition” of bitcoin forks is “drastically different, if even existent, when compared to bitcoin.”      UPDATE (June 9, 2020 14:46 UTC): This piece has been updated to reflect the returns of an equal-weighted index of bitcoin and its top three forks as 3.5 times greater than bitcoin returns, not 14 times greater as originally stated.

That's one question U.S. investors should be considering now that China-based bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer Ebang has filed its $100 million initial public offering (IPO) in the U.S.      It's not the first time the company has filed an IPO, according to CoinDesk Research's in-depth look at the manufacturer. That first attempt, on Hong Kong's exchange, failed. And Ebang isn't even the first Chinese bitcoin mining hardware company to file a U.S. IPO. That honor goes to Canaan, which filed a $400 million IPO on Nasdaq but only raised $90 million.      Ebang could certainly use a financial boost. Gyrations in bitcoin's price affect mining profitability. A sustained price drop often crowds out small and inefficient miners from the market, and that has a direct effect on the companies making the mining hardware.

Some takeaways:    On the surface, Ebang’s U.S. IPO prospectus describes a company facing hardships caused by industry volatility. However, upon further inspection, Ebang’s problems appear to run deeper.  In its prospectus, Ebang notes its revenue write-offs were “significant” in 2018. Nonetheless, the company fails to disclose the extent of the write-offs, which were only partly discoverable after using back-end calculations in combination with its redacted Hong Kong IPO application. This omission of detail coupled with past allegations of sales fraud and a list of disputes from its largest customers gives significant reason for concern.  Ebang’s public accounting firm has identified material weaknesses in the company’s financial reporting. In response, Ebang made additions to its management team including a new CFO, albeit one with a controversial past, and a new financial controller who just completed her undergrad a few years ago.  Ebang’s current product offering of ASIC miners is quickly becoming outdated leading to the company having to sell its equipment at prices far below its cost to produce. Given the lack of detail within the prospectus, it’s uncertain when the company will be able to produce new models that are competitive to those produced by Bitmain and MicroBT.

42432040,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN96Th,1591634148,"Blockchain Bites: Coinbase Surveillance, Bitcoin Wargames, CoinMarketCap Drama","The global COVID-19 crunch appears to be driving interest in cryptocurrencies in developing nations.      Meanwhile, Coinbase has initiated federal-level procurement deals for an analytics tool and Chinese police have frozen potentially thousands of crypto accounts. Here's the story:      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Emerging Markets Lebanon’s financial crisis has banks looking for alternative monetary policy and citizens scrambling for alternative banking services. Approximately $54,916 worth of bitcoins have traded in the country over the past year on Paxful and LocalBitcoins, a small sum compared to the monthly upwards estimate of $5 million transacted through informal networks. Many see bitcoin and other cryptos as playing an increasingly important role in the nation's financial ecosystem. This is part of a greater trend, driven by a U.S. dollar shortage worldwide, of developing nations turning to bitcoin, stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies. The latest Money Reimagined newsletter examines the dynamics causing people across Latin America, the Middle East and Africa to experiment with novel payment and value preserving technologies.      National Security?    Coinbase has initiated procurement deals with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for a cryptocurrency investigations tool called “Coinbase Analytics,” after buying blockchain intelligence firm Neutrino last year.  The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) reportedly used blockchain to distribute an unknown proportion of the 50 billion Saudi riyals, approximately $13.35 billion, in stimulus funding given to banks. (The Block)  A state-owned power grid company in Russia claims crypto miners have stolen almost $6.6 million in energy from local providers over the past three years, by building underground mining farms and tampering with electrical systems.  Thousands of cryptocurrency users and over-the-counter merchants may have had their accounts frozen last week. A police probe in China’s Guangdong province appears to be targeting transactions that may be linked to telecommunication frauds, Ponzi schemes and casino businesses.    Gamifying Crypto The U.S. military has created a war game to think through a response to a “Zbellion,” or a cyberattack led by Generation Z who steal money from “the establishment” and funnel it through bitcoin. Meanwhile, AstroCanvas, a game built by two developers at the Cross-Chain Hackathon, is a demonstration meant to increase network participation in proof-of-stake blockchains and reduce the control that massive players like Coinbase exert on a network.      Development? Coinbase said it’s working on technical changes to prevent exchange outages during periods of increased usage. Last week a traffic spike caused severe disruption of services. Separately, the Algorand Foundation launched an accelerator program offering up to $265,000 in support for Asia-focused projects building on its network. (The Block) Finally, CoinMarketCap has rolled out a new way of ranking exchanges that keeps owner Binance at the top of the exchange table. The data aggregator received criticism last month when its new corporate owner received a perfect score in a new ranking metric.      Crypto Long & Short CoinDesk Head of Research Noelle Acheson looks at the role technologies play in creating and mending economic inequality in the latest Crypto Long & Short newsletter. “[Technology] has widened the chasm between those that can harness it and those that as yet cannot. It has enthralled populations, who are now captive to its influence. It has sped up flows of capital, while further concentrating its distribution,” she said. With the growing adoption of crypto and blockchain technology, the process looks set to reverse, albeit slowly, through practical application.    Market intel    Price Consolidation Investors remain confident in bitcoin’s long-term prospects despite the cryptocurrency’s struggle to pass $10,000, according to the amount of bitcoin moved out of exchanges. Historically, investors have moved cryptocurrency from their wallets to exchanges to be able to more quickly liquidate holdings during a price crash. Over the last four months, however, exchange balances have declined by nearly 13%, signaling that investors expect the ongoing price consolidation to pave the way for a stronger bull run.      First Mover Many crypto investors believe trillions of dollars of money injections by global central banks will usher in an era of inflation, helping to send prices for bitcoin, seen as a hedge against inflation, to the moon. This thesis is at ends with Wall Street investors, who are pumping capital into bond markets at a rate that signals consumer-price increases over the next five years will average levels below the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation target. The First Mover team digs into the dichotomy.      Post-Halving Fees Bitcoin’s average transaction fees have fallen by 83% to $1.083, the lowest level since the network’s post-halving high. (Decrypt)    CoinDesk Podcast Network    Let's Talk Bitcoin! Crypto luminaries Andreas M. Antonopoulos, Jonathan Mohan and Stephanie Murphy join the latest episode of Let’s Talk Bitcoin to discuss prospects of being your own bank. “The powerful idea and meme at the core of Bitcoin self-sovereignty is incredibly empowering but has an unspoken element that requires persistent competence and at least for some makes it more trouble than it’s worth,” CoinDesk's Adam B.

42432032,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN96Bh,1591632912,Lithuania Is Trialing a CBDC No One Can Use – And That’s by Design,"Lithuania's central bank is one month away from minting money too advanced for nearly anyone to use.      That's because Lietuvos Bankas' upcoming coinage is no pocket change or banknote – it's a digital currency on the NEM blockchain. The Bank of Lithuania is issuing ""LBCoin"" tokens – a commemorative digital token exchangeable for physical legal tender – with technology its own officials say no shopkeeper has the e-wallet necessary to accept.      LBCoin's planned July launch follows more than two years of blockchain experiments by the Bank of Lithuania, at a time when interest is mounting in central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).      However, Lithuania's plans for distributed ledger technologies stretch far beyond numismatic novelties. Since March 2018, the central bank has been teaching itself all about blockchain, said Head of Innovation Andrius Adamonis, who is also the bank's blockchain project manager.      ""[LBCoin] will be a very interesting project because some people say it's like a small-scale experimentation about CBDC,"" Adamonis told CoinDesk.      In addition to these collectible cryptos, blockchain sandbox LBChain demonstrated how Lithuania can foster and grow fintech startups. The Bank of Lithuania is now even more ambitious about blockchain, Adamonis said. He wants to pitch Lithuania's ministries of energy and health on a cross-agency, multi-blockchain platform called LTChain that the whole government could use.    Fintech sandbox    That two-year LBChain project brought fintech companies onto closed blockchain testing environments by IBM Poland, which used Hyperledger Fabric, and Nordic IT firm Tieto, which trialed Corda.      Read more: Lithuania’s Central Bank Unveils Blockchain Startup Sandbox      LBChain's 11 participating fintechs built blockchain-based applications for the financial sector. For example, Ledgity, a French project, ginned up a ""Digital Private Bank"" in IBM's sandbox that streamlined enforcement of investing in tokens.      Other fintechs developed Credit Default Swaps (CDS) insurance smart contracts, blockchain-based RegTech programs and digital bond-buying platforms for their respective LBChain projects, to name a few. The project was implemented by pre-commercial procurement.      Some projects simultaneously demonstrated the value and market pitfalls of widely deploying blockchain tech. Adamonis noted that a shared know-your-customer (KYC) platform promised to let clients ""move from one bank to another bank very easily"" – a win for customers. But not the commercial banks who feared losing accounts to competitors.      ""For us it was very good to experiment as a market regulator because we were using test money, dummy data,"" Adamonis said.    Lithuania's blockchain future    LBChain's three-phase research stage is now complete, meaning the stakes are about to get real. Adamonis said the bank is now preparing to take LBChain live with the public.      The sandbox will feature two cohorts of five fintechs building out applications in either Corda or Fabric over extendable six-month stints. Adamonis is open to adding more blockchain platforms to LBChain over time.      LBChain taught the bank to work with blockchains and showed it where they might prove useful – in financial services and beyond, Adamonis said. The bank is now looking into expanding the trial for wider use across Lithuania's IT infrastructure.      ""We don't need to limit ourselves to one market, to one sector, to finance,"" Adamonis said. He pointed to interconnected systems, like a tax authority collecting fees, or an energy provider collecting payments, or a health ministry provider seeking to build networks between providers.      All of them could benefit from an interoperable blockchain system of their own. Adamonis called it LTChain. He said the central bank will begin discussions with government ministries soon.    Commemorative coins    In the short term, LBCoin is hurtling toward debut. Last week, the Bank of Lithuania commenced final security tests on what may well be the world's least usable central bank issuance.      Commemorative coins seldom circulate. Made of metals more precious than their face value, these coins tend to land in safes and display cases, not cash registers, Adamonis said. But LBCoin, as a blockchain-based token, will never land in a cash register.      Adamonis said Lithuanian merchants ""do not have e-wallets on their machines"" to accept LBcoin tokens, which are not legal tender while on the blockchain (The physical LBCoins the tokens represent are legal tender, however).      ""We thought that we would limit daily usage of this coin [by issuing its token] in a way that no shop in Lithuania could accept,"" he explained.      Nabbing one of the bank's 4,000 LBCoins will be an admittedly obtuse ordeal. Prospectors must first amass six distinct digital tokens by trading for them with fellow owners of a bank-issued, randomized six-pack token stack.      Adamonis compared LBCoin trading to the NBA player sticker books that he said were once popular in Lithuania. Then, as now, ""you will need to trade with colleagues or people from around the world"" to finish the collection.      Traders can keep their digital tokens in the bank's e-wallet, transfer them to a public NEM wallet, exchange or regift them, said Pavel Lipnevič, LBCoin project manager. Eventually, savvy collectors can trade in their blockchain mintage for a physical silver coin.      Read more: Central Banks Mull Creating a CBDC, but Not on a Blockchain: Survey      Lipnevič said the physical coin could ""theoretically could be used as a legal tender."" But he advised against it, and stressed that LBcoin has no such status while on the blockchain.      The bank claims LBCoin, which commemorates Lithuania's independence from Russia 102 years ago, is the central banking world's first blockchain-based collector's item. (Coincidentally, Russia's central bank issued a silver coin commemorating blockchain earlier this year.)      If LBCoin sounds like a grand marketing gimmick on a blockchain, that may be because the project is, sort of.      ""We want to cheer up numismatics, which is a dying area,"" Marius Jurgilas, a central bank board member, told The Baltic Course last year. ""Probably, a very small number of young people are now interested in collecting [coins], but this is what central banks do, and we think of ways to remain in this changing environment.""      But appeasing a new age of money lovers is only the public-facing angle in LBCoin's dual mandate. The other, deeper purpose was to train the bank on yet one more application of blockchain tech.      ""We seek to gain experience and knowledge in the field of creation of the virtual currency,"" said Lipnevič. ""This topic is gaining particular importance in light of discussions on CBDC.""

42432030,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN967h,1591628533,Coinbase Outlines Tech Plan to Help Avert Future Outages,"After a traffic spike again caused severe disruption of its exchange service – and angered users – Coinbase said it's working on technical changes aimed to provide more stability in the future.      In a blog post published late on Friday, Coinbase said it is ready to implement ""a number of improvements,"" which would allow the exchange's servers to handle a sudden surge in usage – as was experienced last Monday.      ""Around 16:05 PDT [23:05 UTC], the price of BTC reached USD $10,000. In connection with the rising price, we experienced a 5x traffic spike over 4 minutes. Our autoscaling was unable to keep pace with this dramatic increase in traffic,"" reads the blog.      This traffic spike led to increased latency, Coinbase said, which had a domino effect on other services. With its servers becoming saturated with users trying to access and use the platform, and error reports also spiked by around 50% as visitors experienced timeouts and other server errors.      Within 20 or so minutes the firm had redeployed its API to increase the number of servers dealing with the traffic, as per the post.      See also: Coinbase Suffers Brief Outage as Bitcoin Tumbles 10% in 30 Minutes      After a review of the issues, Coinbase went on to list some of the changes that are currently being implemented to prevent similar traffic-spike outages from happening again:      The server ""health check"" system, which caused erroneous automated responses that worsened the June 1 issue, has already been updated to ensure that overloaded processes don't get taken out of service.      Coinbase is also adjusting its systems to lower the impact of traffic spikes though ""pre-scaling"" – creating more server instances under heavy load. It will also rely more on caching, which has users load a stored version of pages in the browser, rather than reload full pages every time the website is visited.      “I personally think that autoscaling is great for the e-commerce industry"" commented Paolo Ardoino, CTO at rival exchange Bitfinex. ""Spikes in website traffic at exchanges can take place within milliseconds and place significant demands on an exchange’s capacity to maintain high availability at all times.""      Longer term, there are other changes planned too. Coinbase was light on the detail, however, saying it aims to improve its ""deployment process to mitigate some of the autoscaling issues we experienced.""

42432031,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN969h,1591621241,Pentagon War Game Envisioned a Generation-Z Rebellion Funded by Bitcoin,"The world has been hit by cyberattacks from a shadowy organization, ""Zbellion,"" that funds itself through stealing fiat currencies from ""the establishment"" and converting it into bitcoin.      Don't panic, though. That scenario is the premise for a war game from the U.S. military, designed in 2018 to prepare troops for future conflicts fought on computers rather than on the field.      Reported by The Intercept, following a Freedom of Information request to the Pentagon, the headquarters of the Department of Defense, the 200-page document shows what the higher echelons of the U.S. military seem to be primarily concerned about with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.      The war game is set in 2025, when an organization based on the dark web, known as ""Zbellion"" exploits dissatisfaction in Generation Z – ""Gen Z"" – who, with poorer life chances than their predecessors, are increasingly disillusioned with American and Western society.      The group encourages Gen Z members to participate in a global cyberattack that steals money from organizations deemed to support ""the establishment.""      The Pentagon document says stolen funds are funneled into bitcoin: ""Zbellion uses software programs to route any proceeds [from the hacks] into laundering programs that ultimately convert national currencies into Bitcoin and make ""small, below the threshold donations"" to ""worthy recipients"" and, if Zbellion members claim financial need, to the member who conducted the attack.""      How exactly the Pentagon imagines Zbellion would convert fiat into bitcoin, whether through an exchange or using a peer-to-peer marketplace, isn't elaborated in the document. It's also possible war game designers used the term ""Bitcoin"" as shorthand for cryptocurrencies in general.      See also: Biden May Not Be Savvy About Big Tech, but He Understands Cybersecurity      Of course, an international cyber conspiracy worth its salt wouldn't pick bitcoin, or any other digital asset on a public blockchain, to funnel illegal funds. Being public means third parties, including the U.S military, can easily monitor transaction flows; being immutable means there's little a hacking group, such as Zbellion, could do to retroactively obfuscate historical transactions.      Furthermore, cyber-surveillance companies, such as Chainalysis, have created increasingly sophisticated tools for identifying and tracking blockchain users.      Unsurprisingly, some of Chainalysis's biggest clients come from the U.S. government: the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to name a few.      Back in August, the DEA prosecuted five dealers who used bitcoin, believing it to be anonymous. “This investigation clearly demonstrates [cryptocurrencies] aren’t safe, they aren’t anonymous, and they can’t evade justice,"" said DEA special agent Doug Coleman at the time.      See also: Fed Paper: Central Bank Digital Currencies Could Replace Commercial Banks – But at a Cost      The Pentagon's ""Zbellion"" war game was designed in 2018, back when initial coin offerings (ICOs) were flourishing, and when there wasn't much serious suggestion that mainstream society, let alone governments, would actually implement the tech.      But a lot has happened since. Facebook has designed its own digital asset; China seems to be motoring ahead with the implementation of a digital yuan; even the Federal Reserve, highly skeptical about cryptocurrencies in 2018, is researching a DLT-based dollar.

42432038,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN96Ph,1591619009,Bitcoin Remains on Hunt for $10K as Holding Sentiment Gains Strength,"Investors remain confident in bitcoin’s long-term prospects despite the cryptocurrency’s struggle to pass $10,000, according to a key on-chain metric.      The seven-day moving average of the total amount of bitcoin held in exchange addresses declined to 2,313,749 on Sunday – the lowest level since December 2018, according to data from blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.      Exchange balances have declined by nearly 13% over the last four months – a change indicative of a shift to a long-term holding strategy. “This could be related to more investors HODLing [holding], moving their funds to cold storage and/or keys they control themselves,” cryptocurrency exchange Luno noted in a weekly email update.      Investors tend to move cryptocurrency from their wallets to exchanges to be able to more quickly liquidate holdings during a price crash or when they expect a price rally to be short-lived.      However, bitcoin's price rise from the March low of $3,867 has been accompanied by a decline in exchange balances.      Further, the metric has been dropping over the last four weeks despite the cryptocurrency’s repeated failure to establish a strong foothold above $10,000 and lackluster, range-bound trading.      As such, it seems likely investors expect the ongoing price consolidation to pave the way for a stronger bull run and are holding on to their investments in the hope of bigger gains to come.      The prospects of a continued upward move look strong, as the diverging trends in bitcoin’s price and exchange balances seen this year are the opposite of what we saw in the second quarter of 2019. At that time, exchange balances rose along with prices, suggesting a lack of confidence in a longer rally.      As the cryptocurrency rallied from $7,900 to $13,800 in the five weeks to June 26, 2019, the seven-day moving average of exchange balances increased by nearly 6%. But bitcoin’s uptrend ran out of steam in the following two weeks, and prices had dropped to $8,000 by the end of September. The slide continued in the fourth quarter with prices hitting lows below $6,500.      This time round, it seems, investors are more confident.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $9,750, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      The cryptocurrency has defended sub-$9,400 levels multiple times in the last four days. The repeated dip demand, coupled with bullish developments on the longer duration technical charts suggest the path of least resistance is to the higher side.      ""Long-term momentum analysis is definitely upside-oriented in my opinion.

42432044,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN96Zh,1591616592,"First Mover: As Bitcoiners Eye Inflation Boost, Wall Street Sees Barely Any for Five Years","There’s a disconnect between crypto markets and Wall Street.      Among bitcoin bulls, a key investment thesis is the trillions of dollars of money injections by global central banks will usher in an era of inflation, helping to send prices for bitcoin, seen as a hedge against inflation, to the moon.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      But trading in global bond markets shows traditional investors expect nothing like the hyperinflation episodes witnessed in places like Zimbabwe and Venezuela.  Just look at breakeven inflation rates – calculated by assessing the difference between yields on inflation-linked notes and regular bonds. It’s a way of gauging traders’ expectations for future inflation, and the current view is that consumer-price increases over the next five years in the U.S. will average levels well below the Federal Reserve's 2% target.      As of Wednesday, the five-year breakeven rate was 1.5%, according to data provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.      That’s down from 1.8% in September – even after the Fed injected more than $3 trillion of new money into the financial system just this year.      The analysis offers a reminder of just how deflationary recessions can be, with rising unemployment that often puts downward pressure on wages and consumers’ demand for goods and services. A report Friday from the U.S. Labor Department put the May unemployment rate at 13%, up from 3.5% in December. Millions of people lost their jobs as businesses slashed their workforces during this year’s coronavirus-induced lockdowns.      “Typically, inflation is going to be linked with employment levels,” Rich Rosenblum, a former Goldman Sachs managing director who’s now co-head of trading at the cryptocurrency-focused firm GSR, wrote in an email. “If the U.S. inflation was below target (sub 2%) when the country was at full employment, then it's even less likely that inflation will arrive when unemployment is sky high.”      Europe and other parts of the world are facing similar situations. While the European Central Bank (ECB) has amassed assets worth over 5 trillion euros, five-year inflation expectations remain at a meager 1.02%, as noted by macro analyst Holger Zschaepitz. The ECB also targets 2% inflation.      Traditional investors may be keying off recent experience showing that large-scale central bank money injections over the past decade have not touched off anything resembling hyperinflation.  The Fed conducted multiple rounds of asset purchases in the six years that followed the 2008 crash, more than quintupling its balance sheet to about $4.5 trillion from $800 billion. Throughout that period, the core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy items whose prices can be volatile, remained well below the central bank’s 2% target.  Could this time be different?      According to Mark Thornton, a senior fellow with the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Alabama, the direct cash handouts to ailing businesses and households might start the new money sloshing around the economy sooner than in 2008, when the Fed mostly relied on banks to lend out the funds.      And GSR’s Rosenblum says unforeseen events, such as heightened geopolitical conflict, could push prices higher. Tensions between the U.S. and China escalated in May, with Washington criticizing Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak as well as its move to curb Hong Kong’s autonomy via a national security bill.      An unexpected choke on “supplies of certain goods (e.g. oil, semiconductors) could cause a surprise rise in inflation,” he wrote. “Even if this rise is temporary and merely a scare, it can be quite damaging.”      One possibility is the Fed’s new money injections haven't really found their way into Main Street commerce as much as onto Wall Street – propping up prices for financial assets like stocks and bonds.      The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks has rallied more than 40% from March lows and is about 8% short of challenging record highs seen in February. Other major equity indices, too, have witnessed stellar rallies.      With few signs of rising inflation, then, and traditional financial markets rallying, big investors might have fewer reasons to pour money into a perceived inflation hedge like bitcoin.      GSR’s Rosenblum noted that bitcoin’s value is in hedging against the risk that inflation might eventually pop up: There’s little to worry about right now, but the deep economic dislocations from the coronavirus and ever-shifting geopolitical winds have created ripe conditions for price spikes to emerge.  “It is more about picking the right instrument that would build in a risk premium if inflation expectations rapidly shifted in the future,” Rosenblum said.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,737 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,804| 24-Hr Low: $9,392      Trend: A bitcoin price indicator is about to turn bullish for the first time in 12 months.      The 50-candle moving average (MA) on the three-day chart is on track to cross above the 100-candle MA in the next 24 hours. The resulting bullish crossover would be the first since mid-June 2019 and the third since October 2015.      Last year, bitcoin's upward move from $4,000 to $9,000, seen in the 2.5-months to mid June, accelerated following the same bull cross. Prices rose as high as $13,800 by the end of the month. Meanwhile, the crossover seen in October 2015 marked the beginning of the mega bull run from $250 to $20,000.      As such, traders may take heart from the impending bull cross, even though it is based on moving averages and is a lagging indicator. Other long-term MA-based indicators like the weekly MACD histogram and the daily chart golden crossover are also painting a bullish picture.      However, the cryptocurrency's recent failures around the $10,000 mark are indicative of buyer exhaustion.      ""Technical analysis comments that until the buyers reclaim $10,500 (February high) resistance as a new support, we would not only not see $11,600-$12,000 supply area tested, but also bitcoin remains at risk of validating bearish rising wedge pattern with target around the $7,600s,"" said Adrian Zdunczyk, a chartered market technician and CEO of trading community The BIRB Nest.      While $10,500 is the level to beat for the bulls, last Tuesday's low of $9,135 is the key support to defend. If breached, bitcoin may see a deeper decline toward $8,600.

42432037,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN96Nh,1591611638,CoinMarketCap Metric Overhaul Keeps Owner Binance at the Top,"The most popular cryptocurrency price aggregator site has rolled out a new way of ranking exchanges that keeps owner Binance at the top of the exchange table.      CoinMarketCap came under fire last month after its new web traffic-based ranking system gave Binance – which acquired the aggregator for a rumored $400 million in April – a perfect score. ""Six weeks in and Binance's acquisition of CoinMarketCap [is] already being abused to manipulate the rankings,"" tweeted an irate Mati Greenspan at the time.      Well, the price site has some good news: ""We have just implemented a new algorithm to replace the previous default ranking of exchanges by Web Traffic Factor,"" reads an upbeat blog post from Thursday.      CoinMarketCap's new ranking system basically amalgamates all the metrics used to rate an exchange's individual markets – its bitcoin or ether market, say – into one easy-to-read score.      There are two components: The market pair is an exchange's reported trading volume, liquidity and web traffic factor, combined to create a single score. This is evaluated by a ""Confidence"" indicator where CoinMarketCap's own algorithm passes judgment on if the score is accurate, or if it looks like it's been fudged.      Carylyne Chan, CoinMarketCap's acting CEO, said in a statement the new rankings ""will provide our users with an accurate reflection of the trading venues, as they are scored on a triage of factors that provide a complete picture."" The ""machine learning algorithm,"" she added, would dynamically adjust to improve accuracy as it receives more data over time.      New metrics, including new ""quantitative factors,"" were currently undergoing tests and could be incorporated into the new ranking system at a later date.      See also: Binance Doesn’t Have a Headquarters Because Bitcoin Doesn’t, Says CEO      Like other price aggregators, CoinMarketCap has been trying to find a solution for dodgy data. As it says on its methodology page, inflating volumes ""to give the impression of legitimacy and a false sense of liquidity in markets ... has, in the past, contributed to eroding confidence in the cryptocurrency industry and has, at times, misled both investors and traders.""      Although CoinMarketCap previously used an adjusted volume metric, which excluded skewed or suspicious data, it was replaced last month with a web traffic factor, the first phase of a new ranking system to improve identifying inflated volumes.      But, as CoinDesk reported last month, eyebrows were raised when Binance, which had been ranked 15 under the old system, moved to the top with a web traffic score of 1,000, the best possible.      CoinMarketCap has denied it favored its owner. Arguing the company was at the beginning of a major overhaul in its ranking system, the company said a balanced and accurate picture would emerge as more metrics came online.      Chan told CoinDesk at the time the ""Web Traffic Factor is one of many factors that will be in the final iteration of the new ranking."" This position was reiterated on Thursday when CoinMarketCap said the ""Web Traffic Factor was only an intermediate step in the development of this comprehensive solution.""      See also: Binance to Announce White-Label Exchange Infrastructure for Local Markets      So, now that it's live, how does CoinMarketCap's fully-iterated rankings treat Binance?      Well, don't expect too many changes. The exchange page, which use the new algorithm, keeps Binance at the top of the table.      In terms of rankings for the largest markets: bitcoin, ether, tether, and litecoin – which comprise around 80% of total activity – Binance consistently takes the top spot.      Along with the high liquidity and volumes as well as a perfect web traffic score, CoinMarketCap has awarded, along with similar pairs for Coinbase and Kraken, a 100% confidence score: it has complete trust in Binance's data.      Speaking to CoinDesk, Chan reiterated that CoinMarketCap only provided neutral data and rankings and did not ""update algorithms to suit anyone's agenda.""

42432034,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN96Hh,1591606839,"Illegal Miners in Russia Stole $6.6M Worth of Electricity, Power Grid Firm Says","Illegally built power stations, tampered power meters and underground mining farms helped “black” miners steal almost $6.6 million (450 million Russian rubles) from local energy providers over the past three years, state-owned power grid company Rosseti said.      The company initially reported the figure in its official Telegram channel (in Russian) and later confirmed the number to CoinDesk. According to Rosseti, it has been looking for mining farms that don’t have any contracts with local power generating firms, but still plug into the electric grids and use generated electricity without paying for it.      It would usually happen on the premises of an already existing business, such as a factory, where the owners want to earn “additional income,” a Rossetti spokesperson told CoinDesk. Other mining farm locations included garages, rented offices, a house in the woods and a former actual farm (for producing food, not bitcoin), where the ASICs were placed.      To steal electricity, the owners would pull an electric cord right to the nearest power line and build their own power transforming stations. In one such case, the owner hid the station literally underground, burying it in the soil in a public forest, according to Rosseti.      People would also tamper with the power meters to make it look like they consume less energy than a mining farm would need – which, in the case of the bitcoin mining, would be more than a kilowatt per hour for a single mining machine, multiplied by thousands of machines per farm.      Since 2017, Rossetti found 35 cases of illegal power consumption in 20 regions of Russia (Russia consists of 85 regions of various size and population density). Each of these cases has been reported to law enforcement officials, Rossetti said.      “We closely analyze the consumption patterns looking for anomalies, inspect the power lines and measure the workload of the stations. Sometimes it’s easy to notice a mining farm by visual signs, like when a building has powerful air conditioning devices and fans installed,” the company said.      Over the last year, people have been illegally mining crypto using computers in a nuclear research institute and through the website of a local utility provider. Rosseti, in turn, has been exploring the other side of the technology, looking for ways to use the distributed ledger to gather the power consumption data more effectively.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/08/illegal-miners-in-russia-stole-66m-worth-of-electricity-power-grid-firm-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1a8fcde68f22c07cc95b12f405837cd5ae421e23-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432027,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN961h,1591605258,Chinese Police Freezing OTC Traders' Bank Accounts Over 'Tainted' Crypto Transactions,"Thousands of cryptocurrency over-the-counter merchants and their clients may have been affected as police in China freeze bank accounts over crypto and fiat assets tainted by illicit activity.      Caught up in a police probe since Thursday, some Chinese crypto buyers and sellers and OTC market makers have already had accounts frozen because their transactions may have been contaminated by money-laundering activities involving cryptocurrencies.      Sun Xiaoxiao, a former staffer at Chinese crypto wallet startup Bixin who now runs an OTC desk, wrote in a Weibo post on Friday his bank accounts had been frozen and it was not an individual case. The action, taken by the police in China's Guangdong province, potentially impacts ""several thousand people,"" he said.      The affected crypto users aren't necessarily accused of any wrongdoing, and the incident raises the wider question of the quantity of cash and crypto assets that has been contaminated by illicit activity. It's a concern because OTC desks are the only fiat currency on- and off-ramps for China-based crypto users who do not have overseas bank accounts.      It's unclear at this stage which precise case the Chinese police are investigating that's prompting the widespread freezes. But Sun detailed in a longer follow-up post on Friday that the usual causes include telecommunication frauds, Ponzi schemes and casino businesses.      It's unusual for individuals to have their bank accounts frozen over tainted cryptocurrency, according to Sun.      In the past, account freezes have been seen when someone tries to convert cryptocurrencies into Chinese yuan without knowing for sure that the fiat money received is ""clean."" There's a chance the funds can later be identified by a police investigation as being linked to money-laundering activities.      ""Now there are also OTC merchants who had their bank accounts frozen because of questions over the source of the coins they bought. That means, besides 'dirty money,' there are also 'dirty coins‘ circulating,"" Sun wrote.      There's a growing trend of using blockchain networks to transfer high-risk capital in China, he added. While previously bitcoin was the first choice for such transactions, the U.S dollar-linked stablecoin tether (USDT) has now become the most popular choice.      As a result of this trend, ""police are also catching up on their knowledge of blockchain. More and more criminal cases have started using on-chain analysis to trace blockchain assets,"" Sun said.      Since September 2017, when China's central bank issued an ban on initial coin offerings and cut off Chinese exchanges' direct channels for fiat currency deposits and withdrawals, peer-to-peer transactions through OTC market makers remain the only way for people in China to buy crypto assets with yuan or exchange crypto coins into cash.      For those whose accounts have been frozen, Sun said they would need to reach out to the relevant law enforcement agency to provide evidence they are an innocent victim. The time it would take to unfreeze the accounts would also depend on the severity of the case, he said.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/08/chinese-police-freezing-otc-traders-bank-accounts-over-tainted-crypto-transactions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/05f726b95568449a4092beba37b6bb1b0cb6f2de-1000x650.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Distributing a “royalty payment” to holders of Lottery.com security tokens Friday, Securitize claims it has become the first registered securities record keeper, a transfer agent that also disburses token-holder payments entirely on a blockchain. Securitize declined to disclose how much in royalty payments it had distributed.      Transfer agents maintain and update securities ownership records as well as distribute payments, like shareholder dividends or interest (in Lottery.com’s case, a portion of raffle revenue) to owners. But transfer agents aren’t always “paying agents,” the ones actually delivering those payments to shareholders, as Securitize essentially says it has become.      Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, told CoinDesk his smart contract-based payout system is the “future” of shareholder payout disbursements. “With this we can basically do instant payouts,” he said, because the token ownership records update in real time and can integrate right with the means to deliver the payouts.      “It's a combination of the two advantages of security tokens that make these processes much more efficient than the traditional way of doing it,” he said.      Domingo pointed to the stock market’s costly-on-the-margins disbursement schemes that he claimed allow transfer agents like Computershare to profit off the dividends they’re meant to deliver. Such inefficiencies are impossible in Securitize’s model, he said.      Read More: Securitize Users Can Now Directly Trade Security Tokens With Just a Web Link      In disbursing the Lottery.com payout, Securitize found more than half of the tokenholders elected to receive their payouts in the stablecoin USDC. This made “the whole process much more efficient and streamlined than sending an ACH, a wire or a bank transfer,” Domingo said.      Securitize is looking to bring its royalty disbursement service to the company's real estate partners next, Domingo said.

42394570,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwCupJ,1591580196,Zcash,"Zcash is a fork of bitcoin and is similar to it in that transaction data is recorded on a public blockchain. However, Zcash offers users the choice of utilizing transparent transactions or private transactions.  Vision  Zcash obscures personal and transaction data through zero-knowledge proofs called zk-SNARKS. Zero-knowledge proofs make it possible for one party to prove that they know the value of something to another party, without revealing any information beyond that they know that value.  Launch and Issuance  After the team released two audits conducted by NCG Group and Coinspect, the Zcash network launched in October of 2016. The network’s maximum supply, like bitcoin, is 21 million coins. For the first four years of Zcash’s existence, 50 ZEC will be mined every ten minutes.  Zcash also has a ‘founder’s reward’, which means that over time, 10% of the total zcash supply will be distributed to investors, founders, employees and advisors. The reward is taken from each block reward for the first four years of the project: 80% of the block reward goes to miners and the remaining 20% goes to the founders. After the project’s first four years, 100% of the block reward will be given to miners. Some founders have committed to donating a portion of their rewards to the Zcash Foundation, the sum of which amounts to more than 10% of the founders’ reward and 1% of zcash’s monetary base.  Network Design and Security  Zcash is a fork of bitcoin, but its developers have modified the code in several ways. Features of Zcash different from bitcoin include its proof-of-work algorithm, its block time (2.5 minutes) and its block size.  Perhaps most notably, Zcash aims to offer more privacy than bitcoin and provides users with the option to use private transactions, keeping transaction information private. It does so by utilizing zero knowledge proofs, also called zk-SNARKS, which obfuscate the addresses of transacting parties as well as the amounts transferred. Zero-knowledge proofs make it possible for one party to prove that they know the value of something to another party, without revealing any information beyond that they know that value.  Monetary Policy  The total possible supply of zcash is 21 million coins. Eventually, 10% of total zcash supply will be allocated to the founders’ reward. Of that allotment, 1.44% will be distributed to the non-profit Zcash Foundation and 1.19% will be distributed to the Electric Coin Company strategic reserve. In addition, 5.72% of the allotment will go to the founders, employees and advisors. The final 1.65% of the allotment will be distributed to investors.  Transaction Processing  Users must choose between two types of transactions when utilizing Zcash: Transparent transactions or private transactions. Transparent transactions make data publicly visible on the blockchain. In contrast, private transactions do not reveal data. It is possible to send funds between transparent and private addresses.  Transactions between two transparent addresses work the same way as transactions in bitcoin, and the transaction data is visible on the public blockchain. Transactions between private addresses are recorded on the blockchain so that it is verifiable that they existed and that associated transaction fees were paid, however the rest of the transaction data is encrypted and not visible on the blockchain.  Coding  Zcash is mostly coded in C++, Rust, Python, TeX and Kotlin.",NEUTRAL,ZEC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | ZEC,Matthew Kimmell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/zcash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c6397e93206bdda9217632ca34accef61cafead-1500x847.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
