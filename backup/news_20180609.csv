42401611,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd0Fev,1528543815,How Blockchain Can Finally Fulfill Its Promise in Global Payments,"Julio Faura is the head of blockchain R&D at Santander.      There has been much debate about the potential benefits of blockchain technology to improve the world of payments -- particularly international payments.  This is a business where many different parties need to reach consensus to route the payments, perform currency conversions, and deploy and manage liquidity in different jurisdictions, all subject to heterogeneous regulatory constraints.  One of the main issues blockchain can tackle is the high complexity of payments networks, due to the fragmentation of the financial industry itself, which makes it impractical for individual banks to deal directly with all other banks on the planet.  For example, when a bank gets a payment instruction from a client, it needs to find a correspondent bank that is willing to take the client's funds and terminate the payment locally at the receiving bank. And in order to do so, the correspondent bank needs to have a nostro or vostro account with the receiving bank (or with another correspondent bank that has access to the receiving bank, thus adding an extra hoop), ideally with enough pre-funded liquidity to complete the payment on the client's behalf.  But when this happens, the receiving bank has no way to verify that the incoming transfer from the (last) correspondent bank, in fact, corresponds to the original client sending the money. That is why a SWIFT message from the sender is needed, so the receiving bank can understand the purpose of the incoming funds, do proper due diligence or anti-money laundering checks on the payment, and inform the receiver of the funds.  All the parties involved have different ledgers, i.e. they do not share a single version of the truth, and the coordination between all these parties is slow and error-prone, many times relying on manual interventions by back-office teams. Furthermore, someone needs to perform currency conversion at either end, and different parties need to manage liquidity levels at nostro/vostro accounts, which involves settling against central bank accounts as well.  Blockchain's promise  Blockchain's big promise is precisely providing that single version of the truth that is missing in the picture above.  Indeed, a true, smart contract-enabled blockchain provides a single ledger and transactional engine where balances can be maintained and transacted upon and where payments can live as single, common digital objects that make messaging and reconciliation unnecessary.  By using smart contracts, different parties can not only register tokenized funds and payments, but they can also set in stone the rules applying to all aspects of the end-to-end payments processes, eliminating errors and misunderstandings, increasing transparency and auditability, and reducing fraud and cyber risk. The result: Everything on the same ledger, with the same smart contracts for all, and with the same computational engine, with no possibility of errors or tampering.  Now, most of the (so-called) decentralised solutions being proposed these days often focus on improving payments processes either by digitizing the messaging layer described above or, even better, eliminating it by creating single, digital representations of payments that can enforce transactions on proprietary ledgers, connected to one another with some sort of inter-ledger protocol. This is indeed a significant improvement on today's message-driven payments processes.  But a key issue arises when one tries to scale such systems, particularly when large payments issued by corporate clients are at stake: management of liquidity.  Indeed, fast (overnight) payments rely on pre-funded nostro accounts, so the correspondent bank has the cash at hand to terminate the payment, thus eliminating any settlement risk. And when these nostro accounts need to be rebalanced over the course of the business day, large sums of money need to be moved through central banks. Again, this is a slow and error-prone process -- at least compared to the real-time transactions, with finality within seconds, promised by permissioned blockchains.  A low velocity of liquidity internationally ends up tying up liquidity at nostros at levels that are higher than really necessary. This is a big problem due to the significant opportunity costs of these funds -- mounting from tens or hundreds of basis points to tens of percentage points in emerging economies.  Enter tokens  The possibility of having digitally native tokens that act as a store of value within the same ledger where payments, commercial bank balances and nostro balances are stored represents a fundamental, revolutionary solution to improve this situation. These tokens can be used to exchange liquidity between liquidity providers and market makers globally in real time.  Through this, it is possible to implement token-based secondary markets for liquidity exchange, which enable liquidity providers to trade with one another with much less friction and improved transparency and reduce the levels of liquidity deployed in nostro accounts in different places due to much higher capital velocity.  With these tokens and the use of smart contracts, participants can even post unused liquidity in certain geographies as collateral to borrow liquidity in places where it is more urgently needed, in real time.  The key here is making these tokens as universal as possible, and capable of supporting all the liquidity needed today in the currency markets – which amount to more than $7 trillion per day, according to the Bank for International Settlements. A significant part of this market is deliverable and therefore liquidity-related.  There are proposals to use cryptocurrencies or unbacked crypto-assets to play this role, but this approach suffers from a number of limitations.  The market risk of such assets is quite difficult to hedge, due to significant volatility, and the total liquidity in circulation is tiny in comparison with what is needed in the market -- a market which works quite well with a rather universal and hyper-liquid asset available today, the U.S. dollar.  As a pragmatic alternative, several leading institutions are working towards producing tokenized, digital central bank money.  Some, like the Utility Settlement Coin project (which my bank, Santander, is part of, alongside with UBS, Deutsche Bank, Bank of New York Mellon and many others), do this through intermediate vehicles that hold the backing funds on a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) account. Others, like project UBIN in Singapore or project Khokha in South Africa, recently implemented and demonstrated by ConsenSys, directly implement RTGS accounts on smart contracts.  Either way, these initiatives show a viable approach to improving liquidity management for commercial banks and market makers, with the promise of providing much greater liquidity velocity and transparency, with the potential result of enabling a significant reduction in liquidity levels within the whole financial system.  As these initiatives mature and flourish, we believe they will become a key enabler of the decentralized, tokenized economy the world is so intrigued about.

42401616,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd0Flo,1528539305,4 Projects Seeking to Solve Ethereum's Privacy Paradox,"Ethereum is transparent to the core.  Much like bitcoin, the platform uses this transparency as part of its security – with it in some ways ensuring that users cannot fake transactions. However, new anxieties are emerging regarding this transparency and the potential problems that such data exposure might have for businesses.  In the past, these privacy concerns have gotten sidelined for other pressing issues, such as scaling, but signs are emerging that the subject is now receiving a fair amount of developer attention.  Indeed, last month, ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin came forward to state his newly evolved perspective on the topic.  ""I'm considerably more pro-privacy than I was a few years ago,"" Buterin wrote.  And it's not just Buterin; several other developers and the businesses they work for have been building technology that could obfuscate some of the information that currently gets blasted over the network that some users might want to conceal.  ""From a blockchain perspective we always say privacy but it's more like data security,"" said Can Kisagun, co-founder of Enigma, a startup building privacy-enhancing technology for the ethereum network.  In fact, it's perhaps become an even more pressing issue since the European data protection law, GDRP, took effect in May. And while it's still unclear how GDPR will impact companies operating on ethereum, beyond that certain applications are simply non-feasible if all information is exposed.  According to Kisagun, countless ethereum projects, such as those dealing with voting, location data, social media and identity, will likely be restricted by the radical transparency of the blockchain.  Jutta Steiner, the CEO of Parity Technologies, ethereum's second-largest software provider, echoed that, stating that without a privacy layer ethereum will not achieve its goal of becoming a decentralized world computer.  Steiner told CoinDesk:  ""I believe blockchain is in itself powerful, but it becomes even more interesting when you combine it with other cryptographic technologies that allow you to build this eventually perfect anonymous computer, global computer, that you can rely on, that's fast.""  The secret store  Parity is one of the company's at the forefront of developing privacy-enhancing tech for ethereum.  Just last month, Parity released ""Secret Store,"" a software that encrypts information while distributing keys to selected authorities who can access it. In this way, the software allows permissioned clients to create and manage cryptographic secrets on ethereum.  ""It encrypts both the storage and the actual code of the smart contract, so in that way, under the assumption that you trust the authorizers not to collude, it provides privacy of any transaction that the contract models and implements,"" Steiner explained.  While Steiner emphasized Secret Store is still in its early phase and has yet to be scrutinized by third-party auditors, the software is already being tested as part of the company's partnership with a global pharmaceutical company.  ""They use it in order to enable the sharing of data between parties that don't trust each other in the supply chain,"" Steiner said.  And while Steiner said using the software on Parity's permissioned clients is a perfect fit, in the future, Parity hopes to release the tech to run on the ethereum mainnet as well. Because in the case of proper data protection, Steiner said, there's been a lot of innovation that remains to be released –decentralized technologies that have been prohibited due to the risks that ethereum's transparency might pose to sensitive data.  Secret Store and other privacy tools ""would lead to a lot of innovation in the space that we haven't seen because of strict privacy limitations,"" Steiner said. ""Medical data, for example, should not sit on a centralized server, I should be in charge of it, I should be an authority that is required to retrieve the data.""  And as it relates to GDPR compliance, there might be even more complications ahead.  Indeed, Parity has already shut down an identity tool – the Parity ICO Passport Service that registered identities with ethereum addresses to allow companies to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements – due to the legislation.  Still, Steiner said that in some ways, the GDPR is aligned with Parity's privacy vision. She told CoinDesk:  ""As a tool, [the Secret Store] implements similar goals to the GDPR. In our perspective we share the same goals, but in principle blockchain is fundamentally not complicit.""  Secret contracts  Another privacy project, Enigma's ""secret contracts,"" looks to provide decentralized application (dapp) developers with some flexibility in concealing some data.  In an upcoming release, secret contracts will provide a trusted execution environment for dapp developers to spin up ethereum smart contracts without publishing that information on-chain. That trusted execution environment will be private storage facilities that Enigma secures the data in.  As such, even the nodes that have performed the computation are blind to its contents.  The verification of that computation, though, is fed back to the ethereum blockchain, so there is some kind of immutable, transparent record of the transaction.  ""We're starting with trusted execution environments, simply because it gives a much better developer experience for our customers, which are developers building applications on ethereum,"" said Kisagun, one of several MIT graduates that founded Enigma.  Going forward, the startup intends to implement a more decentralized approach, using multi-party computation as a way of securing complex data sets. And while this approach may have performance tradeoffs, Kisagun said, it's more reliable when it comes to highly sensitive data.  While Enigma plans on taking its technology to other smart contract platforms in the future, the team is currently focused on solving ethereum privacy problems first.  ""Ethereum obviously has the most vibrant community right now, it has the most mindshare synced into it, and we want to tap into this vibrant developer ecosystem,"" Kisagun told CoinDesk, adding:  ""I think in crypto it's fair to say you're as strong as your ecosystem and that's why we've chosen this initial trajectory.""  Time-locked secrets  Built at a 36-hour ethereum hackathon in Argentina last month, Kimono is a privacy project that seeks to combine encryption with game theory.  Conceived by four developers from San Francisco-based software startup Hill Street Labs – Paul Fletcher-Hill, Feridun Mert Celebi, Graham Kaemmer, and Daniel Que – the project aims to solve a problem long discussed within blockchains, that of the time-locked secret.  Kimono works by combining a type of algorithm called Shamir's Secret Sharing, that splits up data into parts, and uses an incentive scheme to ensure participants reveal the data at the agreed time. If users try to game the system, by falsifying data or publishing it too early, they'll be penalized as a result.  While other similar methods, like commit and reveal schemes, already exist, Kimono seeks to improve the user experience of time-locking by outsourcing the effort to a network of incentivized participants.  ""We see the concept of time locking as an important primitive and we would like to improve it and get it to a level where it's actually truly decentralized and trustless,"" Celebi said.  Going forward, Celebi theorized the incentive scheme could be extended, so that time is not the only variable that releases a secret.  ""We could have a way to structure that, that it's revealed after a certain event happens – not only relying on the function of time as a variable but maybe other conditions being met on the blockchain,"" he told CoinDesk.  Currently, the software is live on ethereum's Rinkeby testnet, and will eventually be integrated with an upcoming project by Hill Street Labs.  Speaking about the benefit of the technology, Celebi told CoinDesk:  ""Time locking is a pretty useful primitive for decentralized networks because as more and more more people move onto ethereum there will be more use for privacy and anonymity.""  More secrets  Finally, while still in the proposal phase, a code change called EIP 1024 designed by developer Tope Alabi seeks to introduce a simple encrypt-decrypt function on the ethereum blockchain.  Explaining the proposal, Alabi told CoinDesk, ""EIP 1024 allows you to generate an encryption key pair using your ethereum private key. This new encryption key pair can then be used to securely send data to any other ethereum address.""  Again, while similar technologies exist already, such as those advanced by Parity and communication protocol Whisper, EIP 1024 dictates a standard that would work across the entirety of ethereum.  ""This means app developers don't have to worry about building for multiple encryption implementations and can just focus on building their app,"" Alabi told CoinDesk.  According to him, the standard, which would work to secure messaging and data transfer, will become increasingly important as newcomers join blockchain technology.  ""Privacy may very well be the catalyst that onboards the next billion users onto the blockchain,"" Alabi said, adding:  ""In a blockchain world where your public and private keys are basically your digital identity, we need a way to pass around sensitive private information in a way that cannot be censored by any central body.""

42380814,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zUPL,1528509591,The Yes Votes Are In: EOS Blockchain to Launch Imminently,"The launch of the EOS blockchain has been a giant experiment in remote self-organization.  Tonight, it took a big leap forward. As anticipated, candidates for the role of validators or ""block producers"" (EOS's equivalent of bitcoin miners) located all over the world voted ""Go"" to take the mainnet live.  EOS is a distributed proof-of-stake blockchain created by Block.One, whose co-founder, Dan Larimer, has pioneered similar systems with BitShares and Steem. The company raised $4 billion to develop the open source software over a year-long initial coin offering.  No one really knew what would happen when the company turned its code over to the world, but with this vote it's coming more clear.  As the software approached release, a group of organizations vying to serve as block producers found each other and formed the EOS Mainnet Launch Group (EMLG). They have so far managed to agree on a number of things, most importantly that they would launch one mainnet for EOS.  Well over 100 candidate organizations participated in a call that started gathering at 1:00 UTC Saturday and the vote occurred roughly 45 minutes later, as over 1800 people watched. The vote to ""Go / No Go"" was unanimous or very nearly so; the moderators did not report out a final count. The meeting was streamed on YouTube by EOS GO.  With this vote, a set of appointed block producers will move to take the network live. These groups have already been designated. This initial network should be stood up at 13:00 UTC, according to a plan presented during the stream. From there, additional validation will be necessary before it takes the final steps to launch.  According to the EOS Mainnet Launch order of events, initiation of the network by appointed block producers will be followed by at least 48 hours of additional testing. Barring major bugs, EOS holders will then be invited to vote for a set of block producers.  EOS goes live once 15 percent of tokens outstanding have been staked to votes and the first set of elected block producers have been established.  As we previously reported, there's still a lot of issues to watch once that happens.  Many of these block producer candidates have put in a lot of time, money and work up to now.
