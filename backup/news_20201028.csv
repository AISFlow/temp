42433009,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2Zvh,1603923067,Two Indicted in Latest Federal Prosecution of SIM-Swapping Crypto Theft,"Federal prosecutors on Wednesday said two men have been indicted for stealing cryptocurrency from victims through a SIM-swapping and phishing fraud scheme.    Twenty-one-year old Jordan K. Milleson of Maryland and 19-year-old Kyell A. Bryan of Pennsylvania allegedly collaborated in the theft of $16,847 in cryptocurrency from one victim (the owner of a ""digital currency investment"" company, says one filing) during the summer of 2019.  Milleson allegedly staged bogus websites and emails through which he ""phished"" login credentials from victims. He, Bryan and others then compromised the victim's mobile phone through SIM swapping, the Department of Justice alleged in a press statement.  Prosecutors additionally claim Bryan tried to ""SWAT"" Milleson's residence in ""retaliation for Milleson failing to share the proceeds of the digital currency theft.""  The pair face allegations of wire fraud, unauthorized access to protected computers in furtherance of fraud, intentional damage to protected computers, aggravated identity theft and wire fraud conspiracy in Maryland's federal district court.    The case should remind members of the cryptocurrency community of the dangers of storing crypto on hot wallets, especially those secured via two-factor authentication methods such as text confirmation. Weakly secured cellular accounts are often an inadequate defense against hackers bent on compromising known crypto holders' wallets.

The foundation building out the decentralized data protocol announced the close of its sale Wednesday in a blog post.      The token sale reached 4,500 individuals, the foundation said, with the team excluding U.S. investors from participating due to compliance reasons. The Graph joins NEAR, Avalanche and Dapper Labs in a stream of high-value public token sales to close in the early days of 2020’s bull market. Some 400 million GRT tokens were sold in an offering that eschewed CoinList in favor of in-house technology. (Know-your-customer checks, however, were conducted by TokenSoft.)      “What we’re excited about with the sale is getting GRT tokens in the hands of indexers, curators and delegators that are going to be participating in the decentralized network,” The Graph co-founder Yaniv Tal told CoinDesk in a Zoom call.      The Graph seeks to be the decentralized infrastructure of Web3, the crypto shorthand for an internet free of rent-seeking intermediaries. Currently in testnet, the data-indexing protocol helps power popular decentralized finance (DeFi) applications such as Uniswap, Balancer and Synthetix, Tal said. Pulling searchable (and usable) data from hard-to-scrape blockchains makes it a decentralized Google of sorts.      The Graph’s token sale announcement also teased a mainnet launch in the next 30–60 days. “Wide distribution of the GRT token was a primary goal of the sale,” The Graph wrote. “The GRT sale accomplished this goal with significant representation from Russia, Vietnam, China, India and Great Britain, with participation from 99 countries in total.”      The firm previously raised $5 million in a private token sale involving Coinbase Ventures and a $2.5 million seed round led by Multicoin Capital.      “We were fortunate to be the first investor in The Graph,” Multicoin Managing Partner Kyle Samani told CoinDesk via Telegram. “Over the last two and a half years, The Graph has matured to become the gold standard for indexing and querying data out of Ethereum and IFPS. It’s incredible to see The Graph cross 300 million queries process per day as they march toward mainnet.”",POSITIVE,GRT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | GRT | TOKEN SALE,Zack Seward,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/28/the-graph-raises-12m-in-grt-token-sale-teases-mainnet-launch-in-30-60-days,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfa508bdb03394fc6930c68c02d67a153568f840-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ether options traders have favored calls over the past month.    Bitcoin trading around $13,184 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 3.6% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $12,894-$13,831  BTC below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bearish signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin slipped Wednesday, going as low as $12,894 around 14:00 UTC (10 a.m. ET), according to CoinDesk 20 data. Prices have picked up a bit since then, at $13,184 as of press time.      Read More: Bitcoin Price Slips Below $13K as Stocks Slide      Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for research firm Fairlead Strategies, said Wednesday was a “risk-off” day where investors were shedding what they consider higher-risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. “Bitcoin is seeing a retracement of its strong up move as risk assets trade off sharply,” Stockton told CoinDesk. Risk assets, which include global equities, slipped Wednesday.    The Nikkei 225 in Asia closed in the red 0.30% as surging coronavirus infections and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election weighed on the index.  The FTSE 100 ended the day down 2.5% as new lockdown restrictions in Europe caused investors to punch the sell button.  In the United States the S&P 500 fell 2.9% as increasing coronavirus cases around the world caused concerns about the global economy's overall health.    Bitcoin’s strong move up Tuesday approached 2019’s high before losing steam. Stockton said that despite Wednesday’s respite, bitcoin still has a strong chance to pass 2019’s price zenith. “The recent breakout above the August high lends a bullish intermediate-term bias,” she added. “Uncertainty is taking its toll on the markets, but we think it will be short-lived.”      Neil Van Huis, director of institutional trading at liquidity provider Blockfills, noted bitcoin’s mining hashrate has dropped to levels not seen since June. Older, inefficient machines are being turned off, which he sees as a huge opportunity to invest in newer mining rigs at these price levels.      “This is good for mining companies,” Van Huis said. “It also comes at a time when prices are rising. With that comes more investment into the space like JPMorgan and PayPal. That should, in my opinion, keep prices bullish, especially now that we cleared that $12,000-$12,500 hurdle for a bit.”      Read More: JPMorgan’s ‘JPM Coin’ Is Live, Execs Say      In the futures market, Denis Vinokourov, head of research at digital asset prime broker Bequant, noted the rise of institutional interest on CME, which surpassed $800 million in open interest Tuesday. “Futures contracts trading at a premium to spot prices even as the October CME expiry is fast approaching this Friday,” he said.      Guy Hirsch, U.S. managing director at multi-asset brokerage eToro, said unpredictable global market fundamentals are actually a good thing for bitcoin. “The election outcome might produce a shift from a pro-business administration into an administration that is much more skeptical about free markets” just as COVID-19 cases hit record levels, he added. ""[W]e could be in for a long winter that may see bitcoin potentially challenge its previous record high set back in 2017,” Hirsch told CoinDesk.    Ether options skew towards calls    Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up in Wednesday trading around $384 and slipping 5.6% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The ether options market has been more favorable towards calls than puts recently. Derivatives exchange Deribit, which is by far the largest ether options venue, has seen 55% calls versus 44% puts the past month, according to data aggregator Genesis Volatility.      Calls are bullish bets in the direction of the underlying assets (in this case, ether) while puts are bearish bets.      Greg Magadini, Genesis Volatility’s CEO, doesn’t see this data as necessarily providing clear direction on ether’s price, but does indicate where liquidity is pooling.      “Seeing more activity on the call side indicates that the call legs have the most liquidity and active participation,” Magadini said. “This is useful for traders to know when structuring less liquid multi-legged trades.""

Avanti Financial’s banking charter was approved unanimously by the Wyoming State Banking Board on Wednesday, becoming the second newly chartered bank in the state in 2020 after Kraken Financial earned approval last month.      Avanti, like Kraken, now has to jump through a few hoops – like raising more capital – before it can be granted a certificate of authority to operate.      “Kraken definitely captured attention, but now that there’s a second one chartered it’s no longer a one-off situation and a trend is in motion,” Long told CoinDesk in an email.      Along with the charter approval, the banking board approved Avanti’s future issuance of Avit, a programmable electronic currency that’s redeemable at par with a U.S. dollar. The Avit is not a security token, meaning it is not a digital representation of an investment that’s expected to generate returns.      The Avit will be issued initially on Bitcoin sidechain Liquid and then on Ethereum, Long said.

The goal: to build an index for hedging the risks associated with different types of stablecoins.      DefiDollar believes users need to diversify risks through a stablecoin aggregator. Take, for example, the censorship risks associated with stablecoins like USDC and USDT that are fiat-backed and issued by known entities. Conversely, crypto-collateralized stablecoins like dai may face smart-contract risks and tend to see slight fluctuations in price that make them less stable than they may sound.      That’s where DefiDollar and its “metastable” DUSD token comes in.      “It’s an insurance layer over existing avenues in DeFi,” co-founder Siddhartha Jain told CoinDesk. “There are a lot of different risks that are present in the ecosystem, the same sort of risks which banks pose because the issuing entity is centralized or probably has blacklisting mechanisms.”      Born of the ETHGlobal HackMoney hackathon in May 2020, DefiDollar launched into a live product on the Ethereum mainnet in six months and currently handles $3 million in volume, Jain said. DUSD is collateralized by Curve Finance LP tokens, according to the project’s documentation.      The company recently announced a governance token, DFD, that will be distributed through a liquidity mining scheme referred to as Initial Liquidity Mining Offering (ILMO). The DFD ILMO is set to go live this week.      Read more: Origin Debuts OUSD, a Stablecoin That Works Like a Savings Account      “Other projects usually do their liquidity mining based on ETH or another stablecoin,” said co-founder Arpit Agarwal. DefiDollar users can use the project’s native stablecoin, DUSD, to generate DFD rewards.      Unlike other token launches, users can claim this initial supply by depositing DUSD and then play a three-day waiting game for the token to launch in full.      DefiDollar co-founders told CoinDesk that after this timeframe, they expect there to be a significant amount of liquidity on the staked tokens when DFD officially launches next week.",POSITIVE,ETH | USDC,ETH | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | USDC,Doreen Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/28/defidollar-raises-12m-to-be-the-risk-insured-stablecoin-layer-for-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b1864a20e2a4dbf6d51e3f710746783959b60e2-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The National Bank of Cambodia hosts Bakong atop the Hyperledger Iroha blockchain designed by Japanese technology company Soramitsu.

42432982,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2a7h,1603904089,"Ethereum, Dark Forests and the Limits of Transparency","“The mempool is a dark forest,” proclaims Ryan Sean Adams, author of the ""Bankless"" newsletter. And he goes on to paint a picture of a dangerous place full of predators – arbitrage bots, front-runners and the like:      “They hide in the mempool waiting to attack. They monitor any and all transactions with the intention to exploit them. If any profitable opportunities arise? They pounce.”    Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.    Scary stuff. There’s only one problem. What Adams describes is not a dark forest. It’s a floodlit plain.      Crypto markets are lit markets, by definition. So predators can see the prey coming. The prey can see them, too – but the prey cannot escape. When you submit an Ethereum transaction, it must wait in that mempool until a miner picks it up. It has nowhere else to go. So it is, to coin a phrase, a “sitting duck.” Every predator in the pool can see it. It inevitably gets replicated, front-run or otherwise stolen. The wonder is that any legitimate transactions ever get verified at all.      Perhaps, instead of a dark forest, we should think of the mempool as like a desert. The sun shines down on it relentlessly and there is nowhere to hide. And it is infested with snakes. A recent BBC documentary filmed baby iguanas emerging from their eggs into the blinding light of the desert floor, then running the gauntlet of a myriad snakes.      Even though they could outrun the snakes, few of them made it: they were continually ambushed, and one false or faltering step was fatal. Few made it to the high ground that the snakes couldn’t reach. The wonder is that any did at all.      See also: Frances Coppola - Banks Are Toast but Crypto Has Lost Its Soul      This, to my mind, is more like the mempool. A desert, blindingly lit and infested with predators. But unlike baby iguanas, Ethereum transactions can’t outrun the snakes.      You might think that if baby iguanas – or Ethereum transactions – can’t outrun the snakes, they don’t deserve to survive. After all, it’s survival of the fittest, isn’t it? No doubt the snakes see it this way. After all, they are only interested in a free lunch. They would happily kill and eat all the iguanas.      But this isn’t intelligent. Intelligent snakes would understand that some of the iguanas must survive, not because iguanas matter but because snakes do. When the surviving iguanas become adults, they will come back to that place to lay their eggs, thus ensuring a future supply of free lunches for snakes and their offspring.    The crypto world eschewed trust in favor of transparency. But transparency doesn’t solve the problem of untrustworthiness in financial markets.    Similarly, if some Ethereum transactions get through without being front-run, copied or stolen, people will continue to issue Ethereum transactions. But if the snakes kill and eat all the baby iguanas, there will be no adults to lay eggs. And if the mempool predators gobble up all, or almost all, Ethereum transactions, people will stop using Ethereum. There will be no more free lunches. All the snakes will have left to eat is each other.      Every human system replicates the natural world in some way, and crypto is no exception. Unrelenting transparency makes markets inefficient and socially unproductive, because legitimate investors are crowded out by speculators. Legitimate investors must find ways of hiding from the speculators, or outrunning them. If they don’t, then eventually there will be no legitimate investors, only arbitrageurs trying to outrun each other. The ecosystem will feed on itself.      So there is a need for “safe spaces.” Dark places, protected from the eyes of predators. Small creatures hide in the safety of their dark burrows when the hawk is flying. Mammals and marsupials create internal safe spaces for their young. Birds create safe spaces in their nests. Reptiles create safe spaces by burying their eggs. Safety is in the dark. Lit places are dangerous places.      See also: Frances Coppola - Mr. Powell, If You Want Higher Inflation, Give People Money      And yet, dark places are also dangerous. Predators in lit markets have to be very fast to outrun their prey; but predators in dark markets have no need for speed. All they need do is hide in the shadows waiting for a tasty meal to pass their way. A dark market that permits predators to enter is not a safe place for legitimate investors.      When conventional “lit” markets became overrun with HFT bots, investment banks offered large investors “dark pools” where they could trade with each other without the risk of being front-run by algos. But Barclays allowed HFT bots into its dark pool, where they happily front-run unsuspecting investors who thought they were safe. Eventually Barclays was caught and forced to drain its dark pool. In 2016, it was fined $70 million for fraud. It was not the only large bank that accepted money from large investors to protect them from HFT bots and money from HFT traders to allow them access to the investors it was supposed to be protecting.      Crypto’s transparency was supposed to eliminate the need for trusted third parties like Barclays. But if transactions can’t clear the mempool without being front-run, copied or stolen, people will inevitably try to find ways of escaping from the mempool. And those ways are likely to involve trusted third parties – though perhaps not investment banks.      In “Ethereum Is a Dark Forest,” DeFi investors Dan Robinson and Georgios Konstantopoulos describe how they tried to outrun the snakes in the mempool. Sadly, they succeeded only in drawing attention to the money they were trying to claim, which of course had not been claimed by anyone else because everyone knew the snakes would get there first.      Robinson and Konstantopoulos came up with some useful advice for wannabe iguanas, notably “snakes are real” (though they call them “monsters”) and “stick to the plan.” But it was this paragraph that caught my eye:      “Better yet, if you happen to know a miner (we didn’t), you could have them include the transaction directly in a block, skipping the mempool – and the monsters – entirely.”      A trusted third party could parachute their iguana directly to the top of the rocks.      See also: The Stablecoin Surge Is Built on Smoke and Mirrors      There’s clearly a profit opportunity here for miners. Some are no doubt already exploiting it. But those who would rely on the helping hands offered by apparently friendly miners might want to remember what happened to the investors who trusted Barclays.      After all, it’s survival of the fittest, in the crypto world. And no-one is going to prosecute a miner for fraud if you pay them to pick your trade up early but they delay just long enough for it to be front-run. In the crypto world, even more than in conventional markets, there is no such thing as a “trusted third party.” If you trust someone, you are probably going to be ripped off.      The crypto world eschewed trust in favor of transparency. But transparency doesn’t solve the problem of untrustworthiness in financial markets. There may be no trusted third parties in fully lit markets, but there is no protection from predators either. Now, the crypto world seems to be swinging back towards trust. But in a world of dog eat dog, or snake eat iguana, who can you really count on?",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | MINING,Frances Coppola,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/28/ethereum-dark-forests-and-the-limits-of-transparency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dcf9dc93215454c560086a59b05124850b37dad2-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432994,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2aTh,1603901300,First Mover: Bitcoin's Latest Rally Proving Irresistible as Bitwise Assets Top $100M,"Bitcoin was lower, pausing a powerful rally that has seen the largest cryptocurrency jump 25% in October to the highest levels since June 2019. Traditional financial-media outlets like Bloomberg News were writing about it.      Prices appeared to hit resistance just below $13,900, close to last year's high. But analysts said that if the level is breached, there appear to be few brake points before the 11-year-old cryptocurrency ascends to $14,000 or beyond.      ""Between the levels of $14,000 and $20,000, there is insufficient price data to single out any specific points of resistance,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency research firm Quantum Economics, told subscribers in a newsletter.      In traditional markets, European stocks dropped to a five-month low and U.S. equity futures were declining, amid investor concerns about rising coronavirus case loads. Gold weakened 0.4% to $1,900 an ounce.    Market moves    Bitcoin's recent rally as U.S. stocks floundered has simply widened the cryptocurrency's outperformance compared with traditional markets. As more investors tune in, the expanding gap could become a self-reinforcing trend.      Following Tuesday's price surge to a new 2020 high around $13,700, bitcoin is now up 90% for the year to date. That puts the cryptocurrency well on pace to exceed last year's 94% gain.      It's also far ahead of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks, where a recent slide has trimmed the year-to-date gains to just 5%, after a 27% rise in 2019.      Many big institutional investors, such as pension funds, are under pressure to hit annual return targets of 7%, and with stocks now faltering and bond yields close to historic lows, they're casting about for alternatives. Bitcoin's track record alone might be enough of a sell, but the 11-year-old cryptocurrency also represents what could be the beachhead of a brand new, state-of-the-art financial system – the digital rails, as the crypto-market ecosystem is described by some industry executives.      Then there's the theory among many investors that bitcoin's fixed supply makes it a useful hedge against central-bank money printing – yet another compelling narrative at a time when top authorities from the Federal Reserve to the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund say massive stimulus is needed to keep the global economy from faltering. As highlighted in this column earlier this week, even analysts for the once-naysaying JPMorgan Chase, the biggest U.S. bank, are now opening discussing bitcoin's potential upside.      ""Every major institution is re-looking at it right now,"" Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of the cryptocurrency-focused money management firm Bitwise, told CoinDesk in a phone interview. ""There's lots of pings in my LinkedIn inbox."" The San Francisco-based firm announced Wednesday that its assets under management recently crossed above $100 million for the first time.      According to Hougan, there are a few key differences now from prior bull runs in bitcoin, such as in 2017 when the cryptocurrency's price shot to up to about $20,000.      There's been a rapid explosion in the industry's support infrastructure, from the development of regulated asset custodians to more reliable pricing feeds and more recently U.S. officials' move to explicitly authorize banks to provide services to cryptocurrency companies. Last week's move by PayPal to let users buy bitcoin offers a new seal of approval from an established company along with an incentive for other big financial firms to follow suit, in order to avoid getting left behind.      Notably, Bitwise has repeatedly failed in its years-long efforts to win approval for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund. But Hougan said his firm has found a growing and welcoming cadre of financial advisors looking to steer money into its cryptocurrency investment funds, since they're among the few assets having any major positive impact in 2020 on clients' portfolios.      ""We're reaping the harvest of two years of building infrastructure in this space,"" Hougan said. ""It's no surprise that we're hitting multiyear highs.""      Digital-asset traders are so familiar with bitcoin's infamous price swings that such bullishness can sometimes sound fawning, breathless, credulous. But right now it's not just crypto money managers selling the story; bitcoin is getting a shot of credibility from its own market performance.    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin has decoupled from stocks this week. Prices narrowly missed the June 20019 high of $13,880 early Wednesday and were last seen at $13,550.      The minor pullback could be attributed to the overbought conditions signaled by the above-70 reading on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI). The 14-week RSI has also crossed above 70.      An overbought reading does not imply a bearish reversal. That said, it often yields a temporary consolidation or pullback similar to the one seen in May and July.      Dips, however, could end up recharging bulls' engine for a stronger rally, as fundamental indicators such as market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score, which measures market value's deviation from realized value to assess undervalued and overvalued conditions. Right now the indicator suggests that bitcoin is far from overvalued and has plenty of room to extend the sharp rally from $3,867 to $13,800 seen over the past 7.5 months.      See Also: MVRV & SOPR: Insight into Investor Sentiment      The MVRV Z-score, currently at 2.12, is hovering at two-year highs, according to data source Glassnode. That's still well below the 7.0 score at which an asset is considered near a top.

42432990,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2aPh,1603901100,"Blockchain Bites: Bitcoin Miners' Slim Margins, ConsenSys' Latest CBDC Pilot, a16z's Power Hire","Bitcoin's hashrate is soaring. Ethereum incubator ConsenSys has signed on to another CBDC pilot. JPMorgan unveiled a revamped interbank transfer blockchain network that could challenge SWIFT.    Top shelf     Lower profits Bitcoin mining profitability is at all-time lows in 2020, spurred in part by new ASIC mining machinery driving up the network’s hashrate. While bitcoin's hashrate has taken a dip as China's wet season comes to an end, mining professionals predict this will only be temporary, and it has only improved profit margins so much, CoinDesk’s Colin Harper reports. According to North American Bitcoin mining company Luxor’s hashprice index, miners are extracting $0.096 for every terahash they produce, down from the roughly $1.40 miners could expect to make three years ago.      ConsenSys CBDCs ConsenSys will work with Societe Generale - Forge, the bank's digital assets arm, in a central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot. The Ethereum incubator will explore the limits of CBDC issuance and management, delivery versus payment and cross-chain interoperability, CoinDesk's Daniel Palmer reports. Societe Generale - Forge has previously issued bonds worth millions of euros over a blockchain, with one of the initiatives being in collaboration with France's central bank. ConsenSys was chosen in September to work with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on a different CBDC pilot.      GBTC whales BlockFi has taken a 5% share of Grayscale’s $4.8 billion bitcoin trust. According to Tuesday Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, reviewed by CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson, the crypto lender now holds 24,235,578 GBTC shares. CEO Zac Prince said in a press statement BlockFi’s “significant” GBTC position will “add value” to the “marketplace for liquid and illiquid” shares. Crypto fund manager Three Arrows Capital is the only other entity with comparable GBTC holdings, having amassed over 21 million shares – some 6.26% of GBTC at the time – by June. (Grayscale and CoinDesk are both wholly owned by Digital Currency Group.)      Banking blockchain JPMorgan is inviting 400-plus financial institutions (including 25 of the largest 50 banks) to start building on top its revamped blockchain network, Liink. Designed to connect banks in a peer-to-peer fashion and help them remove the pain points from cross-border payments, the closed source Liink is more of a “decentralized network” and less like a “central command product,” Christine Moy, head of Liink, told CoinDesk’s Ian Allison. “Think of it as the foundation of an enterprise mainnet.” The interbank transfer system is aimed as a complement of – but could be a killer to – SWIFT.      Power hire The one-time New York State finance regulator who shepherded the state’s BitLicense through its early days will join tech ventures fund Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) to focus on cryptocurrency companies. An a16z blog post said the fund's new chief regulatory officer, Anthony Albanese, will focus on crypto portfolio companies in ""gaming, digital storage, payment systems, social media, creative marketplaces and more."" “We’re seeing so much happening in the frontier areas like DeFi and stablecoins but also among the legacy financial services institutions from PayPal to JPMorgan,"" said Katie Haun, an a16z general partner.

Explaining the concept of “proof-of-personhood,” the authors aim to outline a new model of consensus that authenticate digital identities, using actual human traits.      Currently, authentication systems rely on algorithms or third party credentials – often provided by centralized firms like Facebook or Twitter – to provide a layer of trust. As we’ve seen by the rise of disinformation and scams, it’s shaky at best.      Further, because the current systems of identity rely on the disclosure of personal and private information to an identifier, it opens our lives to a degree of surveillance never before possible.      “Identity is one of our most fundamental human rights. Yet, in the age of surveillance, commodification and centralization it is under threat,” they write.      Their solution, proof-of-personhood, explained for the first time as part of CoinDesk’s Internet 2030 series, outlines ways to form identities around subjective, rather than objective, metrics. “Instead of being generated and solved by computation, they are created and unlocked exclusively by the distinctive cognitive abilities of human brains,” they write.      In turn, rather than having the web as a field of exploitation, by matching real-world identities to digital ones, in ways that preserves privacy and human dignity, will “foster prosocial, community-oriented behavior, where both users and applications are significantly limited in their ability to exploit and attack each other.”      The authors also go into the areas where blockchains and other decentralized tools, as well as AI, have already failed to meet this need. If you’re interested in the idea of digital utopias, I suggest you read the entire article.    Market intel    Overbought bitcoin? A key indicator shows bitcoin’s recent rally is not overstretched. The ""market value to realized value"" (MVRV) Z-score – a measure used to assess undervalued and overvalued conditions – is showing bitcoin at lower levels than one would expect, if this were a market top, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports. Hovering at two-year highs at 2.12, bitcoin is still well below the 7.0 score at which an asset is considered overbought. “Put simply, the cryptocurrency is slightly overvalued but still has plenty of room to extend the run of gains from the low of $3,867 seen since mid-March,” Godbole writes.

At the current price of $12,980, the top cryptocurrency by market value is down over 5% on the day and 7% from the Asian session high of $13,857. That was the highest level since June 2019, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  The cryptocurrency looked overbought and vulnerable to minor pullback early today, having rallied by over 20% this month alone.  However, the pullback's magnitude is likely being amplified by the losses in the global stock markets.  Wall Street's benchmark equity index S&P 500 is down over 2% at press time, and the pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 index has shed 4%. Meanwhile, the anti-risk sentiment is boding well for haven assets like the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, and U.S. Treasury bonds.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, is up over 0.5% at 93.50, while the U.S. 10-year yield is down nearly three basis points.  However, gold, also a haven asset, is struggling to draw bids and is trading at $1,876, down 1.7% on the day.

In partnership with FTX, Hxro built its product TixWix to target a “global retail audience” of would-be crypto options traders by distilling complex market data in a format familiar to anyone who uses other prediction and betting platforms for sports, politics, etc., CEO Dan Gunsberg told CoinDesk.      Hxro entered the cryptocurrency trading market in March 2019 with its gamified binary futures product MoonRekt, as CoinDesk reported, which launched to a waiting list of more than 100,000 users. Since starting the company, Hxro's co-founders Gunsberg and Rob Levy have relied on their prior careers as traders in traditional markets to design novel products for crypto traders.      Their new product, announced Wednesday, leverages FTX’s back end to support an options trading interface that abstracts away the “complexities of non-linear risk factors” and “complexity around the Greeks,” Gunsberg said, referring to common measures of risk – delta, theta, gamma and rho – used by options traders.      Instead of an otherwise complicated options contract with a 5% chance of expiring at a given price, for example, TixWix serves the same trade as a simple bet with 20-to-1 odds, Levy explained.      At launch, the new product supports bitcoin and ether markets with two types of bets: Tix, a bet that the market will close above a certain price by a given date, and Wix, a bet that the price will touch a certain price at some point before a given date.      TixWix is the first instance of FTX serving as a back-end provider, CEO Sam Bankman-Fried told CoinDesk. His exchange already has experience offering with betting and prediction markets, however, with its increasingly popular U.S. presidential election markets that have seen record volumes ahead of the Nov. 3 event.      More broadly, TixWix is a bet by both teams on the future growth of the general cryptocurrency options market, Levy told CoinDesk. “There’s enormous upside for options trading products in crypto. Options are an extremely powerful, useful tool.""      The size of options trading in traditional markets is one reason Levy expects significant growth in crypto options. “The explosion of stock options that we’ve seen in legacy markets is about to be seen in crypto,” Levy said. “You need liquidity for that to happen, and we’re starting to see real liquidity come into crypto.""

According to a report in September, ConsenSys was chosen to work with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on a different CBDC pilot, looking at how blockchain might facilitate cross-border payments between commercial banks.  The developer also acquired JPMorgan's blockchain platform Quorum this summer – that's the platform on which the investment bank's JPM Coin cryptocurrency was built.  The first commercial use of JPM Coin is expected within the week, JPMorgan executives said Tuesday.

42405331,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLyvY,1603884057,Is Bitcoin's Rally Overstretched? This Key Indicator Says No,"A historically reliable fundamental analysis indicator suggests bitcoin's rally has scope to continue after its rapid rise to new 2020 highs, contradicting signals on the technical charts.    While bitcoin's ""market value to realized value"" (MVRV) Z-score is hovering at two-year highs at 2.12, according to data source Glassnode, that's still well below the 7.0 score at which an asset is considered near a top.  The MVRV Z-score measures the deviation of market value from realized value, and is used to assess undervalued and overvalued conditions.  Put simply, the cryptocurrency is slightly overvalued but still has plenty of room to extend the run of gains from the low of $3,867 seen since mid-March.  The indicator backs up billionaire hedge fund manager and philanthropist Paul Tudor Jones' recent comments that bitcoin's rally has just begun.  Historically, an MVRV Z-score below zero has marked bear market lows, while a reading above 7 has marked major bull market tops.  The Z-score fell below zero, indicating undervalued conditions following the March 12-13 crash, which saw prices fall as low as $3,867.  Since then, the cryptocurrency has largely stayed on an uptrend.  Conflicting signals  Bitcoin's 14-week relative strength index (RSI), a popular gauge of price momentum, has crossed above 70.00 on the charts.  According to the technical analysis (TA) theory, an above-70 figure is a sign an asset is overbought.  The 14-day RSI, too, is flashing a similar signal.  TA studies, however, are lagging indicators as they are based on price and relatively less reliable.  ""In a trending market, indicators such as the RSI can remain in an 'overbought' or 'oversold' state for extended periods of time,"" trader and analyst Nick Cote told CoinDesk.  Bitcoin's current uptrend looks strong because it's backed by increased institutional participation and expectations for mainstream adoption.  Online payments giant PayPal recently announced support for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  The overbought signal does not imply a bearish reversal, but may yield a minor pullback or consolidation similar to those seen in May and August.  ""For bitcoin, institutionalization is the primary driver for growth in this next bull market. As such, it's better to observe on-chain metrics,"" Cote said.  At press time, bitcoin is trading lower near $13,520, having narrowly missed breaching the June 2019 high of $13,880 during the Asian trading hours.

The attack, which lasted less than 30 minutes, saw the website defaced with messages claiming the hackers had compromising information on Trump and his family.  As reported by The New York Times, the hackers were soliciting donations in the monero cryptocurrency due to its privacy-enhancing properties that make it hard to trace.  The cybercriminals said they had compromised ""multiple devices,"" giving them access to the “most internal and secret conversations” of the president and his inner circle.  Onlookers were given a choice: they could either donate monero to a wallet that prompted the hackers to ""share the data"" or another wallet asking them to keep it private.  Trump's administration was accused without evidence of participating in the spread of COVID-19 and collaborating with “foreign actors manipulating the 2020 elections.”  The New York Times also reported the website takeover and subsequent solicitation of crypto donations appeared to be a variation on the common crypto ""giveaway"" scam.  Such scams ask people to send money to a particular address with the false promise of doubling or returning a victim's funds.  Similar attacks hit major accounts on Twitter back in July, including that of former Vice President Joe Biden.  The source of the attack is unclear, but an investigation is currently underway by U.S. law enforcement.  The incident comes as the U.S. presidential election campaign between incumbent Trump and challenger Biden enters its last week.  Biden is far ahead of Trump when it comes to donations, according to another NYT article.

42405315,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLygn,1603857653,JPMorgan Invites Banks and Fintechs to Build on Its Revamped Blockchain Network,"“Think of it as the foundation of an enterprise mainnet.”      That’s how Christine Moy, head of JPMorgan’s newly rebranded Liink banking network, described its aspirations towards decentralization in the realm of big business.      The revamped Liink, which is based on a fork of Ethereum, is more of a “decentralized network,” said Moy, and less like a “central command product.” As such, Liink now invites its 400-plus financial institutions (including 25 of the largest 50 banks) to start building on top of the platform.      “Liink participants have the ability to build applications on the network, and in doing so are able to spotlight their local expertise with global reach,” said Moy. “If a Liink participant has specific expertise around payments in a particular region or currency, for example, it has the opportunity to build an application and deploy it on Liink to make it available to the network.”      Read more: JPMorgan’s ‘JPM Coin’ Is Live, Execs Say      Formerly known as the drably named Interbank Information Network, Liink was designed to connect banks in a peer-to-peer fashion and help them remove the pain points from cross-border payments and other functions.      While Liink is not open-source like Quorum or, say, R3’s Corda network, JPMorgan is encouraging collaboration within the network and also expanding it beyond banks.      “The focus has been on building a peer-to-peer network for cross-border payments, thus the original name, Interbank Information Network, but we are now also incorporating corporates and fintechs into the Liink ecosystem as well,” said Moy.    JPM’s next step?    JPMorgan, which is famous in the blockchain world for creating the Ethereum-based Quorum network, released a flurry of news Tuesday, the headline being that its wholesale banking digital currency JPM Coin is now live. But also that all Quorum-based services now fall under the new Onyx brand.      “Liink as a new brand comes at a pivotal time, as we look to re-architect how money, information and assets move across the globe,” Umar Farooq, CEO of Onyx, said in a statement.      On the subject of JPM Coin complementing the Liink network, Moy said:    “The Liink network is live for peer-to-peer information transfer. JPM Coin is obviously value transfer. As part of the broader Onyx organization, we are focused on a coherent client product experience.”    It’s a lingering question: How might JPMorgan’s various blockchain services be combined into a greater sum than their parts? JPMorgan declined to comment further.      As well as rebranding, Liink introduces a couple of new features: Confirm, which allows for the validation of account information prior to initiating a payment, and Format, which helps ensure a payment message accurately conforms to country- and currency-specific requirements.      The Confirm application matches data requesters, looking to validate account owners and FX particulars, with data responders, who are incentivized to help because they can earn a cut of fees for validating that information.      “This is a blockchain-based, multi-party network so you have the ability to get a response from multiple different banks on the network, or for that matter tech companies,” said Moy. “Enabling our Liink participants to potentially create new revenue streams, we think, is a differentiator from other offerings where a central party controls the flow.”      All told, it looks like JPM’s Liink is shaping up to be a potential SWIFT killer.      “Liink’s original use cases were modeled by JPMorgan for banks,” said Moy. “We’ve paid special attention to some of the specific mechanisms of how we would design this application as a result,” she said, adding:    “The aim is not to replace SWIFT but rather to complement it.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/28/jpmorgan-invites-banks-and-fintechs-to-build-on-its-revamped-blockchain-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a8d9edfdab1876ac2d9e28d3d22b6d02a5bdcb5-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
