42398707,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgOqv,1443821151,Dutch Central Bank Research Head 'Not Opposed' to Bitcoin,"De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) head of research Jakob de Haan has issued new responses to pointed questions about the role of bitcoin in global finance.  During a speech at the reinvent.money conference on 26th September, de Haan was asked several questions about bitcoin, including ones that referred to the euro derogatorily as a ""bullshit fiat currency"", with unusual candor given his status at the Dutch central bank.  A newly surfaced video shows de Haan responding to the question of whether his organization is afraid it may be replaced by decentralized financial technologies, such as bitcoin, suggesting his institution remains open-minded about the technology.  De Haan said:  ""Apparently, there are a few people convinced [digital currencies] are the future. Let's wait and see. I'm not opposed to all these initiatives and if you're right, the world will be very different and I will lose my job, but by then I'll be retired I guess.""  De Haan went on to note that he was personally ""not an expert"" in bitcoin, but that the central bank is following the emerging technology closely and that researchers have been delved into the topic.  ""You might think we are fundamentally opposed to these alternatives, we are not,"" he said.  Further, he noted how the organization has taken steps to clarify to the public that digital currencies, while accepted as payment at select locations, don't come with the same consumer protections as traditional alternatives, which it did in May 2014.  De Haan called such guidance ""important"" and countered a later question about whether it will be beneficial for the public should private currencies compete with public alternatives, by suggesting that bitcoin's volatility against fiat currencies is an issue to its wider use.  De Haan concluded:  ""Ordinary people benefit from price stability and that is the most important mandate for central banks.""

42398703,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgOox,1443815450,Nasdaq Blockchain Chief: Bitcoin's Currency and Ledger are 'Two Innovations',"2015 has seen no shortage of major financial institutions jumping onboard the blockchain bandwagon – in the last two months alone, more than 22 banks have announced pilot projects focused on the emerging technology.  One of the earliest and most vocal financial institutions in the fray, however, was US stock exchange Nasdaq, which revealed in May it had been working for a year to harness bitcoin's distributed ledger for private stock sales.  Whether the bitcoin blockchain will emerge as the one ledger to rule them all, a predecessor to more refined, enterprise-grade technologies or one blockchain among many, remains to be seen, but Nasdaq suggests it is equally interested in any of these possible futures.  In an exclusive interview, Fredrik Voss, vice president and head of blockchain strategy at Nasdaq, spoke to CoinDesk about his organization's strategy for communicating its thesis on the technology to those just delving into similar research.  Voss told CoinDesk:  ""You get confusion around bitcoin and blockchain, there is an increased understanding that there are two innovations, the asset and the technology innovation.""  Appointed in June, Voss previously served as the company's deputy head of commodities, but admits he was a ""newcomer"" to the technology before assuming the position.  Voss presented a clear roadmap for Nasdaq's development, adding candidly that the company is not ""married"" to the bitcoin blockchain, but is rather ""ledger agnostic"" in its approach, believing bitcoin remains the best ledger system for its current needs.  Still, it's the underlying technology that Voss believes holds ""great potential"" to solve pain points in the operation of financial markets due to attributes such as its auditability and security.  ""That is what attracted me and attracted Nasdaq, and the potential of creating efficiencies and releasing capital that is locked into post-trade processes. Those are powerful and attractive attributes,"" Voss said, adding:  ""Now of course it remains to be proved that those things can be deliver.""  The comments comes as part of a wider interview that finds the firm opening up about its stance on bitcoin, touching on topics such as the role of blockchains in settlement and how its work fits into the broader explorations being conducted by major banks.  Inside the initiative  Voss described Nasdaq's blockchain operations as informal yet expansive in scope.  For example, he declined to disclose how many full-time team members the company had working on the technology, but suggested the number of those working on such projects ""once a week or once a day"" is above 25.  Nasdaq's blockchain group, he said, is divided into technologists; those performing supporting functions such as communication, information security and legal work; and its business unit, which defines the use cases on which it experiments.  ""Currently, it is really a combination of informing, inspiring and encouraging the organization and the unit to see where the opportunities are with this technology,"" Voss explained. ""It's not that we've set aside money and resources and we sit in a room and think big thoughts, we're leveraging the entire organization and using the organization as it is.""  Certain departments, he hinted, are looking at proofs of concept and prototypes, though he declined to reveal details about unannounced projects.  Question of ownership  Voss also weighed in with his view on the more theoretical arguments ongoing in the space, elaborating on his view of how asset management should ideally function on a blockchain.  For example, in its Nasdaq Private Market, private shares are issued via colored coins, a process by which the metadata of a bitcoin can be augmented to represent a real-world asset. Up for debate is how beneficial this advent is when more advanced blockchains using smart contracts can move data sophisticated enough to serve as the asset itself.  Voss, however, dismissed this concern as academic, arguing that while this outcome may be desirable in the long term, more simplistic uses of blockchain technology still offer advantages over today's best practices.  ""You have electronic representations of paper-based certificates and you have electronic representations of physical assets in other markets. The attractive attributes of a distributed ledger is the settlement immediacy of even those tokens,"" he said.  Voss argued that today's technology lacks the ability to achieve ""immediate settlement"".  ""Then there's the distribution and the efficiency you can have when not having to replicate the same transaction over and over and over again, and you can have the 24/7 aspect, you're operating around the clock which in most markets is difficult to achieve,"" he continued.  Looking out, he acknowledged having assets directly embedded into the blockchain would be more beneficial, but suggested Nasdaq still believes the technology is attractive today.  R3's emergence  Voss further provided clarity to Nasdaq's work and how it fits into the large experimentations being conducted by major financial institutions.  Addressing distributed ledger startup R3 CEV and its acquisition of 22 major banking partners, Voss said he was encouraged ""more sources and more brains"" are entering the space, even if he doesn't envision major stock exchanges striking a similar alliance.  ""We think it will increase the pace of work in the field, but I think it's too early to talk about bank-chains or exchange-chains, it feels too much like early days,"" Voss stated.  Voss suggested he would be happy to share findings with major banks, but suggested its emphasis would be on matters relevant to its business. This included making its clearing and depositories more efficient and improving the technology it licenses to partners.  ""We have a market technology business where we provide settlement solutions to others around the world, and for us to add distributed ledger systems to those systems adds value for those clients,"" he said.  Private markets work  Voss was less open about the ongoing work being conducted by partner and portfolio startup Chain to develop its new blockchain-based Nasdaq Private Market.  However, he emphasized that the project is on schedule and that it continues to meet internal benchmarks, even as similar products are also set for launch by companies including Digital Asset Holdings and Symbiont, among others.  ""What I can say is we make public what we make public,"" he said. ""We've set up a number of milestones internally, we're hitting those milestones and proof of concepts and putting out releases of user interfaces and testing those.""  Should this positive progress continue, Voss suggested Nasdaq could launch its Private Market product before the year's end.

42398705,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgOst,1443809023,Bitcoin in the Headlines: R3's Blockchain Dream Team,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly analysis of bitcoin media coverage and its impact.  Major banks are now loudly proclaiming their love for the distributed ledger.  However, the bank's love explosion for blockchain technology may not have been what Satoshi Nakamoto intended – or predicted – when bitcoin was first created.  Despite this, this week's coverage was mostly about blockchain technology, as distributed ledger startup R3CEV caused a ripple of excitement again when it announced an additional 13 banks had joined its project.  Elsewhere, a prominent science publication published a piece about the future of cryptocurrencies, focusing on bitcoin's origins, its association with illicit behaviour and the ongoing fascination with the blockchain.  Industry signs  The Financial Times' Kadhim Shubber began his piece on R3's big deal, noting how Citi, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley had joined the growing and still secretive initiative.  Shubber wrote:  ""The addition of the banks, which also include HSBC, BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank and seven others, is a sign the industry is gathering behind R3 in one potential implementation of the distributed ledger technology behind the currency bitcoin.""  Blockchain technology has enjoyed increasing popularity among traditional finance institutions and executives. Earlier this year, Blythe Masters, a former JP Morgan executive shocked with her decision to join Digital Asset Holdings as the company's CEO.  As Shubber points out, Digital Asset – R3's seeming competitor – is just one of many startups attempting to reduce costs in banking.  ""Blockchain is the shared database technology beneath the currency bitcoin and is being touted as a way of overhauling outdated bank back-office systems. Its backers point to inefficiencies in the aging network of bank payments and settlements, where transactions in markets like syndicated loans can take 20 or more days to finalise,"" said the journalist.  Integrating the technology  Writing for CNBC  , Matt Clinch began his piece by commenting how the latest announcement suggested a wider acceptance of bitcoin.  ""Rather than shunning potentially disruptive digital currencies,"" he said, before adding,""the biggest names in the financial industry are looking at integrating the technology behind bitcoin into every day use"".  The good news for bitcoin was short-lived as the journalist then duly noted, that the blockchain – not the digital currency – is what really seems to have captivated mass-attention.  He said:  ""Bitcoin is a virtual currency that allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services. However, many see the real worth of the cryptocurrency being the technology behind the coin. Called the blockchain -- this is a public and transparent ledger of all bitcoin transactions.""  The article then rounded off with a cautious conclusion.  ""It might still be early days but the technology could effectively allow payments to be made instantly without a centralized authority and it would also be transparent with each bank being allowed access to the ledger,"" said the reporter.  The 'dream team'  Oscar Williams-Grut alluded to the desirability of the banks' all star-team with the headline ""13 More Banks Just Joined The Finance 'Dream Team' Working on Bitcoin's Blockchain"".  Taking the total number of bank partners to 22, Williams-Grut noted how the list read like a ""who's who of investment banking"".  Similarly to his contemporaries, the journalist then went to outline the basic principles of blockchain technology:  ""The software cuts out the need for a 'trusted middleman' to sit in between parties in a transaction as it acts as that middleman. This makes transactions quicker, cheaper, and easier when compared to the current systems bank use.""  For these reasons, the journalist added, ""banks are keen to see whether it can be adapted for use with traditional currency, rather than just bitcoin"".  On this note, Nasdaq's Martin Tillier wrote a piece titled ""The Irony Behind Banks' Interest in Blockchain"" where he noted the issues that may aries if blockchain development boosts the digital currency markets.  He then noted: ""The possibilities if that is done are endless so that focus is understandable, but one of the side effects of all the publicity is to add strength to the currency, and that could end up having a detrimental effect on those very same banks.""  Bitcoin and beyond  Nature, a prestigious science journal, published a piece detailing bitcoin's short, albeit eventful history.  It began:  ""When the digital currency bitcoin came to life in January 2009, it was noticed by almost no one apart from the handful of programmes who followed cryptography. Its origins were shadowy: it had been conceived the previous year by a still-mysterious person or group known only by the alias Satoshi Nakamoto.""  The article continued: ""And its purpose seemed quixotic: bitcoin was to be a 'cryptocurrency', in which strong encryption algorithms were exploited in a new way to secure transactions. Users' identities would be shielded by pseudonyms. Records would be completely decentralised. And no one would be in charge – not governments, not banks, not even Nakamoto.""  Yet, the article adds, the idea caught on:  ""Some of its growth is attributable to criminals taking advantage of the anonymity for drug trafficking and worse. But the system is also drawing interest from financial institutions ... It has inspired the creation of some 700 cryptocurrencies. And on 15 September, bitcoin officially came of age in academia with the launch of Ledger, the first journal dedicated to the cryptocurrency research.""  Bitcoin aside, what really fascinates academics and entrepreneurs is ""the innovation at bitcoin's core"", the blockchain, reads the article, which cites Nicolas Courtois, a cryptographer at University College London, who says that bitcoin's blockchain could be ""the most important invention of the 21st century – if only bitcoin were not constantly shooting itself in the foot"".  So there you have it, the blockchain is ""hot stuff"" and with little sign of banks' fascination with it abating, it is probably fair to say that October will see more blockchain loving.

42398709,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgOvq,1443784640,Anti-Virus Tycoon John McAfee Accepts Bitcoin for Presidential Run,"Anti-virus software pioneer John McAfee is now accepting bitcoin in his 2016 presidential campaign.  The self-proclaimed ""eccentric millionaire"", who founded McAfee in 1987, shared the link to a BitPay donation page with his 29,000 Twitter followers yesterday.  McAfee, with his colourful history and upcoming court date for a DUI charge, has surprised many with his candidacy.  He announced he would run in the election on 8th September with his new party, the 'Cyber Party' to rally against government snooping and bureaucracy.  All other donations for McAfee's campaign are being processed through PayPal.  In-kind donation  Last year, the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) approved the digital currency as an in-kind donation for campaigns and political action committees (PACs).  In line with these rules, donations in bitcoin are limited to $2,700 – and require a number of personal details, including the donor's name, address and place of employment.  McAfee joins fellow presidential candidate Rand Paul, who began accepting the currency for his presidential campaign in April, having previously expressed skepticism on the subject.  The Senator's run has since been marred with several high-profile struggles, with Bookmaker William Hill now putting his odds at 125-1.  Fellow tech CEO Carly Fiorina, who lead Hewlett-Packard between 1999 and 2005, announced her decision to run on 4th May. Her odds are currently 12-1. McAfee is yet to be listed.

42398712,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgOwp,1443782995,Bitcoin Company Coinplug Raises $5 Million in Funding,"South Korean bitcoin services company Coinplug has closed a $5m Series B funding round.  The company drew support from firms including SBI Investment raising its cumulative funding to date to $8.3m.  Joon Hyuk Park, investment director at SBI, told CoinDesk blockchain technology's potential to change legacy financial services, coupled with the team's business background and their execution capabilities had influenced his firm's decision to invest.  Ryan Uhr, Coinplug's CEO, said the funding will be used to ""ramp up development of its blockchain-based services"", adding:  ""In the future, Coinplug is planning on presenting a global remittance service. Also, we will focus on developing an efficient and competitive blockchain platform ... and provide the platform for major banks in Korea.""  The company, which also operates a bitcoin exchange and provides bitcoin wallets, is discussing various blockchain strategies with several banks.  Chief among these is Coinplug's new blockchain-based authentication service for which the company won 50m KRW ($45,500) at a FinTech competition, which was held in June this year and sponsored by major banking group JB Financial.  A statement issued by the company said Coinplug held patents for this kind of technology as well as a number of other blockchain systems, which it plans to sell internationally.  Coinplug's CEO concluded: ""The reason we applied for patents in the first place is that we want to present our recently developed and developing blockchain-based technological services to other industries. Also, we wish that blockchain technology would become more widely used and accepted in Korea.""

42398711,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgOxo,1443777349,Study: Google Searches Can Predict Bitcoin Trading Volume,"Google search data can predict the price of bitcoin, new research has found.  Academics from the University of Cagliari, Italy, compared USD trading volume with data from Google Trends in the 12 months leading up to July 2015.  The results, detailed in their new paper, indicated that search volumes for the keyword 'bitcoin' correlated with – and sometimes predicted – the currency's market volumes.  Using a Pearson correlation, which shows the relationship between two variables on a scale of -1 (lowest) to +1 (highest), Martina Matta, Ilaria Lunesu and Michele Marchesi found a positive correlation equal to 0.6. This means trading volumes ""[follow] the same direction pace of queries volumes,"" they said.  The trio found the Google Trends data also functioned as a ""good predictor"", because of its high cross correlation value (calculated using a Granger causality series). This means query volumes were able to anticipate trading volumes in ""almost three days"".  The researchers say they would like to test out their hypothesis on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Google+.  Search terms  The team's research supports findings from previous studies that have compared public interest in bitcoin with the currency's market performance.  A 2014 report from Swiss university ETH Zurich concluded that surges in searches and tweets about the currency lead to major price fluctuations. While a 'positive feedback loop' saw price rises increase search volume, which in turn increased the price, high search volume also functioned as an indicator for those planning to sell off their coins, lowering the price, it said.  Another paper from the finance department at Nicolaus Copernicus University, Poland, observed that bitcoin returns tended to grow when the currency was searched for, alongside its mentions in the media.  A 1% increase in articles that mentioned bitcoin would raise returns by 0.3% (30 basis points), while a similar increase in Google searches would pump returns by 0.5% (around 50 basis points), it said.
