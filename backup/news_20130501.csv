42424834,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWnVh,1367435927,eBay CEO weighs PayPal bitcoin option,"eBay chief executive John Donahoe has confirmed the e-commerce giant is looking at ways to integrate bitcoins into its PayPal payments network.  ""It’s a new disruptive technology, so, yeah, we’re looking at bitcoin closely,"" Donahoe said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. ""There may be ways to enable it inside PayPal.""  eBay hasn't yet made any commitments to use the currency, Donahoe added, comparing the digital currency to early music sharing sites such as Napster.  ""Virtual currency is something that's here to stay,"" he said.  Last week, PayPal president David Marcus said he was ""fascinated"" by bitcoin and that his company was considering the currency.  ""For us it's a question of whether bitcoin will make its way to PayPal's funding instrument or not,"" Marcus told Bloomberg TV. ""We’re thinking about it.""  While alternative currencies like bitcoin have the potential to be disruptive technologies, they are all still in the early stages of development, a spokesperson for PayPal has said.  ""As the company that created the online payments category over a decade ago, PayPal knows how hard it can be to manage payments globally in a regulated environment,"" the spokesperson said. ""We're closely following this area and look forward to seeing how it develops.""  The addition of bitcoin to the PayPal network would give the burgeoning digital currency some much-needed legitimacy. There has also been speculation that other money transfer services such as Western Union and Moneygram are looking at bitcoin.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Doug Watt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/01/ebay-ceo-weighs-paypal-bitcoin-option,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/148b8a95ff3f5f8b3604c3ab2acd6de7f7745452-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424828,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWnNh,1367429454,Bitcoin via SMS is here,"A new service hopes to bring mobile bitcoin payments to the masses. The service, called Bits, has already demonstrated bitcoin payments made via text message from one mobile phone to another.  Conceived by Cody Burns, who was a front-end software developer at COG1, a San Francisco-based web and mobile app company, Bits enables payments via SMS, QR codes or tapping together phones with near-field communications (NFC) capabilities. The company promises ""almost zero fees"" for making and receiving payments, and says payments should be processed in under 10 minutes.  This isn't the only service to offer mobile payments, however. Bitpay also has mobile checkout apps for Android and iOS, which allow the mobile phones to collect payments in person. However, that service requires customers to have a mobile bitcoin wallet to scan a custom QR code provided by the retailer (the QR code contains the bill details).  Similarly, Coinbase has a point-of-sale (PoS) solution that allows retailers to accept bitcoin using a mobile device. It features an Android app and a mobile website, and uses the same QR code mechanism. Scandinavian service BIPS also offers a mobile checkout solution.  The difference with the Bits system is that no mobile client is needed. Bits retailers and users begin their signup process simply by texting the word ""SIGNUP"" to a Bits-provided number.  Registered retailers display the Bits logo to indicate they can take payments via text message. Registered customers can then send a simple text message containing the retailer's phone number, along with the amount to send and a short description of the item: for example, ""send 3.50 to 505 xxx-xxx for chocolate bar"". Once the text is sent, the transaction is complete.  Bits demonstrated the process at this week's TechCrunch Disrupt conference in New York City by having a representative pay for a hot dog in Times Square.  One advantage of the Bits system is that it doesn't require a native bitcoin wallet on a user's smartphone. This will come as a relief to iPhone owners, who are prohibited by Apple's strict App Store policy from installing bitcoin wallets on their phones.  Mobile payments have been possible in conventional currencies for some time now, thanks to companies like Square, which offers a mobile credit-card reader that plugs into a smartphone. But more bitcoin payment options are now becoming available for smartphones.  These services haven't always run smoothly, however. For example, Paytunia, which offered a web and mobile browser-based wallet (and is owned by Paymium, which also operates Bitcoin Central) experienced a security breach in early April. A big Bitcoin Central hack also took place last week.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/01/bitcoin-via-sms-is-here,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424838,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWndh,1367424236,Bitcoin ups and downs unraveling Silk Road?,"The deep web black market site Silk Road is known for two things: as a place to buy drugs and other illegal products, and for being an early adopter of bitcoin.  However, the site appears to have experienced some unusual troubles recently and some analysts are tying Silk Road's problems directly to bitcoin.  Silk Road suffered a lengthy outage in the last 24 hours, apparently due to a denial of service (DDoS) attack. The site has resumed service, but there's speculation that hackers attack places like Silk Road because of the connection to bitcoin (some bitcoin exchanges, notably the largest, Mt. Gox, have also been forced to deal with DDoS attacks).  Willard Foxton, the Telegraph's ""skulduggery"" reporter, wrote earlier today that one of his ""sleazier"" contacts emailed him to report that Silk Road had collapsed. Foxton adds the site was inaccessible by Tor browser when he tried to take a look for himself.  The larger issue for Silk Road and other vendors accepting bitcoin is the digital currency’s volatility. Bitcoin’s price jumped to around $250 earlier this year before plunging to around $60. It has since recovered to well above $100 and was trading around $130 Wednesday morning.  But the price movements cause both hyperinflation and hyperdeflation. When bitcoin prices surge nobody wants to buy, and when prices fall nobody wants to sell. So the volatility means that no one wants to use bitcoins for transactions -- better to just hang on and see what happens.  That’s a real problem for Silk Road and others transacting in bitcoin. Who wants to use bitcoin to buy a product when tomorrow that same bitcoin could be worth a lot more (or a lot less)?  There is some good news: the bitcoin price has been relatively stable for the last couple of weeks. Stability will help people feel more comfortable using bitcoins to buy and sell, rather than speculating on the price movement. In addition, more vendors are signing on to use bitcoins, increasing the size of the market, which will also help to encourage the use of bitcoins in everyday transactions.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Doug Watt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2013/05/01/bitcoin-ups-and-downs-unraveling-silk-road,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

These are exciting times. Every day there are developments in price, investment, technology, crime and regulation. There are plenty of sceptics and a few optimists pushing new concepts and innovation.  We created CoinDesk to fill a knowledge gap and answer questions people have around digital currency. That includes the 72-year old pensioner wondering how Bitcoin works, to the CFO of a Nasdaq company, or the prime minister of Cyprus wondering what OpenCoin is. CoinDesk is also a source for journalists covering this space or for folks running small e-commerce businesses wondering how to take payment.  Enthusiasts compare digital currency with the internet in the mid-1990s. People built and sold companies in record times. There were new web browsers, sites and internet service providers almost every day.  Others believe it to be a bubble that will soon burst. Economists say it is deflationary and unreliable. Sceptics dislike the uncertainties and unstable price.  What we do know for sure is that it’s going to be an interesting space to watch. So thanks for visiting. We hope you enjoy reading.

42424844,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWnlh,1367401444,Traade buys smartphones for bitcoins,"A new service is offering people bitcoins for old smartphones. Traade will pay for phones in the Ecoin and will then recycle them.  The North Carolina-based company is starting with smartphones, but wants to extend its services into other devices, such as personal music players, tablet computers, laptops, and cameras. It will eventually cover “all electronics”, it said.  Users can search for their smartphone model to get a quote from the company, based on its condition. If the user accepts the quote, Traade will send them a prepaid envelope in which the user returns the smartphone. The bitcoins are then credited to the user’s account.  “Once we receive and inspect your device your bitcoins will be transferred directly to your Bitcoin wallet according to the address you provide,” said the company.  Currently, a 16Gb Galaxy SIII will fetch 0.95 bitcoins in good condition, gaining the user roughly $126 at today’s prices.

42424831,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWnPh,1367399571,Canada to tax bitcoin users,"The Canada Revenue Agency has clarified its position on bitcoin. It has laid out two different tax rules, covering transactions made for goods or services in bitcoin, and for profits made through speculative trades.  According to a report by Canada's CBC, the CRA will invoke its barter transaction rules when bitcoins are used to buy goods or services. These are laid out in paragraph 3 of its Interpretation Bulletin. The document says that the value of whatever is received is at least equal to the value of what is given up.  The CRA also has a document called Transactions in Securities, which says that profits made on commodity transactions could be income or capital.  Joseph David, founder of the Calgary-based Virtex bitcoin exchange, advises people to declare capital gains on any transactions made with bitcoins. “We tell anyone that if you have a capital gain on a bitcoin transaction, you’re obligated to report it,” he says.  However, it isn’t clear how the CRA would enforce taxes on bitcoins acquired if they were not converted to dollars. The anonymous nature of the system makes it difficult to track the cryptocurrency if it is acquired and spent without being cashed in.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/01/canada-to-tax-bitcoin-users,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42395335,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASkVBZ,1367398840,10 companies that use bitcoins,"Why would a ""regular"" business -- as opposed to a deep web marketplace like Silk Road -- accept bitcoins?  Lots of reasons, say bitcoin-loving entrepreneurs. The digital currency is better at protecting privacy than, say, credit cards are. And a bitcoin business makes it easy for people anywhere in the world to buy, no matter what the local monetary situation or restrictions might be.  For many business owners, though, the decision is a purely practical one: bitcoin transactions are simply cheaper to process ... and sometimes quicker too. For them, anything that puts more money in their wallets or accounts faster is a good thing.  Transaction fees for bitcoin payments tend to be around 1 percent, compared to the 2 to 5 percent hit imposed by credit cards. Plus, there are no foreign transaction fees. Finally, because payments don’t move through banks, money transfers from buyer to seller on the same day -- with credit cards, the waiting period can last a week or more.  Customers who pay with bitcoins benefit in other ways too. Their financial data is much more secure than it would be with credit cards, and transactions are – if not completely anonymous – not easily traced to their identities.  By now, bitcoin fans -- who tend to be a highly tech-savvy bunch -- are already probably aware that internet operations like reddit and WordPress (more on that one below) take bitcoin payments. But a growing number of other types of businesses, including those of the traditional brick-and-mortar variety, are also embracing the virtual currency:  Bitmit  Bitmit is rather like eBay. It’s a shopping platform accessible to people from all over the world who wish to buy or sell goods for bitcoins.  For bitcoin users, the advantage is obvious: there is no need to work through countless types of currencies used by buyers and sellers in different countries or to incur foreign transaction fees from credit card companies.  For customers who might be wary about handing over their money – fiat or otherwise – to a person known only by a pseudonym on the site, Bitmit offers an escrow service: “On orders with enabled escrow option the (b)itcoins are … transferred to the seller (only) when the buyer has set the item status to received or when the buyer has rated the order positively. It puts a stop to potential fraudsters because there is no chance to commit a successful fraud.”  Update: Bitmit has since closed it's doors after problems with security.  Bitcoins for Boston  Bitcoins for Boston  is a relief fund created by Trey Copeland. It is intended to raise $10,000 for the hospitals that treated victims of the April 15, 2013, Boston Marathon bombings. The site is intended to be up for just one month.  “On May 15, 2013, all donated bitcoins will be cashed out at market value and donated to the Boston Marathon Bombing fund at Boston Medical Center,” the site states.  Such charitable ventures are ideal for the currency. As Bitcoin Magazine has noted, “Donations have been a mainstay of the bitcoin economy since the very early days and it makes sense because of the ease at which bitcoins can be sent with virtually no transaction fees.”  Bitcoin Coffee  Bitcoin Coffee  sells a variety of premium coffees and teas. The Alabama-based business’ tagline is “where cryptocurrency meets café.” The company stresses that it accepts bitcoin because it cares for privacy, although it does also offer the option to pay with a credit card. The default setting shows all prices in bitcoin, though customers can opt for US dollar amounts.  EVR Bar in Midtown Manhattan  EVR’ s co-owner, Charlie Shrem, declared, ""When we opened a few months ago, I said that we needed to be the first New York bar to accept bitcoins."" That’s not at all surprising, considering that Shrem is the CEO and co-founder of the bitcoin payment processor BitInstant. He also is co-chairman of Bitcoin Foundation, which is devoted to advancing the digital currency. Shrem ways bitcoins are better for business because they cost less in transaction fees and enable faster money transfers.  Foodler  On April 17, Foodler, the site that offers online ordering for delivery from over 12,000 restaurants, announced it would accept payment via bitcoin. Christian Dumontet, co-founder of Foodler, explains: “Interest in bitcoin is soaring … we wanted to provide an easy way for the more than 11 million people with bitcoins to pay for their meal deliveries.” Bitcoins can be transferred to a customer’s Foodler account to appear as credits in the form of US dollars that can be used to pay for orders and even for tips.  Pacific Tradewinds Hostel  The Pacific Tradewinds San Francisco Backpacker Hostel caters to “off-the-beaten-path” backpackers. Hostel rates are an affordable $29.50; by keeping the price under $30, San Francisco’s 15.5 percent tax on hotel stays over that amount doesn’t kick in. Owner Darren Overby tells visitors the hostel appreciates direct bookings and cash payments, so it doesn’t incur commission charges and fees. Considering that travelers who use hostels are typically budget-conscious, it makes sense for the hostel to offer a payment option that takes less of a cut in fees.  A-Class Limousine  A-Class Limousineis the first (and, for now, only) limousine company in the New York area that accepts bitcoins. As do other bitcoin-loving businesses, A-Class Limousine identifies the savings on credit card processing and transaction fees as the most important factor in choosing to accept bitcoins. But it also considers it a safer bet for its clients, as it “is secured by complicated encryption making it impossible to crack or hack” their data.  Mega  Mega, a cloud-based data storage provider that describes itself as “the privacy company,” emphasizes its use of advanced encryption to protect customers’ privacy and security. It set up Bitvoucher to make it possible for users to pay for upgrades with bitcoins and avoid having to give out personal information the way credit cards and PayPal do. The Bitvoucher pagehttps://bitvoucher.co/help/faq/ proclaims: “your personal details are not our business.”  OKCupid  OKCupid began accepting bitcoin payment on April 16, making it “the biggest brand name” to date to sign on with the digital currency, according to the Financial Times. With four million users, OKCupid is part of IAC, a media and internet company whose holdings include Ask.com, Vimeo and Match.com. While OKCupid boasts of being “completely free,” it also offers an “A-List” premium subscription for $10 a month.  Declaring “we want to be out in front,” OKCupid CEO Sam Yagan told Forbes, “There’s no question that these digital currencies are going to be the future.” Yagan says he sees a parallel between bitcoin’s business model and his own: “We use math to get you dates and they use math to make transactions secure.”  WordPress  WordPress announced its embrace of bitcoin on Nov. 15, 2012, when it posted Pay Another Way: Bitcoin. The blog hosting and management provider explained that its mission is “making publishing democratic – accessible and easy for anyone, anywhere.”  According to WordPress, the company found that “limits on traditional payment networks” interfered with its goal of accessibility.  “PayPal alone blocks access from over 60 countries, and many credit card companies have similar restrictions,” it noted, explaining why it sought out a new form of payment that would not be blocked. “Unlike credit cards and PayPal, bitcoin has no central authority and no way to lock entire countries out of the network.”  Whether it’s a matter of improving their bottom lines or about supporting the values of individual freedom and privacy, a growing number of businesses is finding that bitcoin fits the bill.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Ariella Brown,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/01/10-companies-that-use-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397142,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYtJ7,1367384440,Feathercoin shows heavyweight potential,"A new currency based on litecoin has gained more traction in two weeks than its predecessor did in a year.  Feathercoin  lets cryptocurrency miners generate a new coin that's very similar to Litecoin, but with far less difficulty. For now, anyway.  Both feathercoin and litecoin are designed to be mined through a different technique than bitcoin. Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 algorithm, whereas the other two use Scrypt, a password-based key derivation function. The biggest difference with Scrypt is that it is biased against FPGA and ASIC miners ... normally the heavyweight machines of the cryptocurrency mining world.  FGPA and ASIC miners throw large amounts of custom-designed computing power at the mathematical problems used for mining. Scrypt, though, is designed using an algorithm that favors CPU and GPU miners. As a result, it makes it easier for those without large sums of money to get in on the cryptocurrency mining game.  ""How these Scrypt coins apply today is that we know ASICs are coming out for SHA-256 coins,"" says Robert VanHazinga, a cryptocurrency specialist who makes his money on arbitrage, and also develops mining software for various clients. VanHazinga also developed cryptocoinexplorer.com, a block explorer for different coins.  ""They can't do Scrypt encryption,"" he says of ASICs. ""They can't do anything with it efficiently.""  Part of the reason for that is Scrypt's use of memory-intensive operations, which are more suited to CPUs, and which have been adapted to GPUs for litecoin and feathercoin.  Unlike litecoin, which was designed to award 50 coins for every block found at the outset, feathercoin awards 200. Feathercoin will eventually have a total of 336 million coins. This is four times that of litecoin ... which in turn has four times the number of coins that will eventually be produced by bitcoin. (Bitcoin's hard limit is 21 million.)  ""It joins the cryptocurrency family by positioning itself with litecoin in the same way that litecoin is aligned with bitcoin,"" states the feathercoin website. ""It does not compete with bitcoin or litecoin, it compliments them [sic].""  Feathercoin calls itself an open-source internet currency.  ""Bitcoin was 50 coins a block and now it's been halved,"" said VanHazinga, adding that feathercoin's designer is ""experimenting by saying, 'Let's have 200 coins, and not put a limit, and let's see what this coin does.' ""  So far, feathercoin is doing well. At the time of writing, 5.5 million feathercoins had been created. Mining pools have already been created, and the cryptocurrency is gaining value over litecoin. Its difficulty has also increased quickly (difficulty reflects how much computing effort is needed to find a new block for a given coin), and continues to increase with the number of people mining the coin. Feathercoins took one week to reach the same level of mining difficulty that litecoin reached in a year.  ""To see feathercoin get to the difficulty level that litecoin took a year to get to, in a matter of weeks, is amazing,"" said VanHazinga.  The low difficulty at feathercoin's birth could be another reason for the currency's popularity. After the massive bitcoin rally in early April, many people might be looking to get in on the ground floor of another cryptocurrency opportunity. Litecoin's age means that its difficulty is now relatively high.  ""You can't CPU-mine litecoin now with the difficulty and have it be worth it,"" VanHazinga said. Feathercoin's difficulty, on the other hand, is still low enough to make CPU mining worthwhile.  The other attraction of Scrypt-based coins is that mining servers can be repurposed. Both CPUs and GPUs can be reapplied either for SHA-256 or Scrypt-based mining. That isn't the case with ASICs, which are programmed with a specific algorithm. FPGAs, while theoretically reprogrammable, aren't good at Scrypt-based mining. This means that many previously involved in SHA-256 mining could decide to shift some mining capabilities over to the new coinage, to spread their risk.  ""One of the concerns of bitcoin right now is because people have to invest in a specialized piece of equipment,"" said VanHazinga. ""This isn't cheap. They're hugely expensive.""  He added, ""When ... the hash rate gets so ridiculous that they're not worth using anymore, you have a nice paperweight.""",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | LTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/01/feathercoin-shows-heavyweight-potential,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
