42399408,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj6y3,1476821875,Bitcoin's Lightning Network Takes a Big Step Toward Interoperability,"The development of a key bitcoin scaling solution has been fragmented to date – but that could soon change.  Major developers behind the Bitcoin Lightning Network met last week in Milan to determine how work on the micropayment layer will advance and how the varied efforts in progress will be standardized. In total, representatives from six projects attended, with those involved calling it a ""culmination"" of efforts that have taken place since the technology was first proposed in 2015.  According to organizers, the idea behind the meeting was to design rules for every implementation to follow so that the currently fragmented projects (of which there are at least eight following their own designs) can ultimately be made interoperable.  Prior to the meeting, Lightning Labs co-founder Elizabeth Stark said the loose group had largely synched up over a series of bi-weekly phone calls and over technical discussion on the Lightning Network mailing list.  Stark told CoinDesk:  ""Without proper in-depth conversations there might be incompatibilities and different ideas. We want all implementations to talk to each other and to work with each other.""  Other participants provided details on how information would be shared as work progresses, with some suggesting early versions of Lightning could be ready for use by the year's end.  For example, Blockstream core tech engineer Christian Decker indicated he feels confident development can now continue toward its goals as a result of the meeting.  ""We managed to nail down all the details needed to interoperate. This concludes the initial exploratory phase and we can now move forward combining all the lessons learned,"" he said.  The highly-anticipated top layer for the bitcoin network is designed to boost transaction capacity and speed (hence “lightning”) in a way that developers say follows bitcoin's original value proposition (a digital currency that doesn't require users to rely on intermediaries).  Widely considered to be the method by which bitcoin will scale without increasing the throughput of its blockchain, the Lightning Network has also been criticized by those that support on-chain methods of scaling.  The decisions  Described at length in the blog post, the group made several decisions about protocol compatibility (what Lightning Network architect Joseph Poon called the ""critical core protocol"") and ultimately decided how each implementation should work into the future.  The specifications include a ""core commitment protocol,"" which will determine how micropayment channels between two users are updated. (The Lightning Network hinges on a cryptographic method called hashed timelock contracts (HTLCs), which ensures payments on the network can not be stolen by intermediaries).  One specification decision was to include a two-stage HTLC scheme proposed by Mats Jerratsch, who is working on Blockchain's Thunder implementation.  The group also discussed specifications for a basic routing protocol for how payments will ultimately hop across the network, and several other implementation details.  These include a format for scrambling the communications between nodes for privacy and a format for outsourcing how channels will be monitored for fraud so that this responsibility does not fall to users.  Progress ahead  So far, the group is planning to solicit feedback from the rest of the bitcoin community before finalizing the specifications and testing the compatibility of the implementations over the coming weeks.  ""For me personally the fact that all teams came to similar conclusions and solutions is a sign that we are on the right track. Now we continue to work on writing a joint specification and adapting the implementations to that specification,"" Decker said.  Elsewhere, representatives expressed the idea this update is a sign that work on more advanced bitcoin technologies continues to more forward.  Valery Vavilov, CEO of Bitfury Group, for example, was keen to cite the progress made by the Scaling Bitcoin event as a whole, which saw a number of technological proposals presented and critiqued and served as a meeting place for the Lightning discussions.  Vavilov told CoinDesk:  ""We feel that the event in Milan was an important step forward for the global adoption of bitcoin and blockchain, for our community and for the Lightning Network overall.""

42399414,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj71z,1476818544,Major Hong Kong Lenders Plot Blockchain Mortgage System Launch,"A group of banks in Hong Kong are reportedly developing a system that uses blockchain tech to share information about mortgage valuations.  According to The Financial Times, the system is being tested by Bank of China and HSBC among a group of lenders in the region. If fully realized, the system will include participants from mortgage lenders in Hong Kong as well as surveyors, who will contribute valuation data.  Involved in the testing of the system are the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI), which earlier this year co-established an innovation hub to support fintech experimentation. The trial is, perhaps, the most high-profile project of its kind to emerge from that effort to date.  The proposed mortgage valuation system is being tested within that framework, and according to FT will be integrated live inside the Bank of China's operations sometime next month.  The paper quoted ASTRI vice president Duncan Wong, who said of the project:  “The reason we focused on the property valuation is because there is less regulatory concern for this.”  As for the other banks looking to take part in the system, those institutions have reportedly begun preparing for an integrated at an as-yet-undisclosed date.

42399418,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj74w,1476809184,More Than 100 Blockchain Pilots Underway at Tata IT Consultancy,"One of India's biggest IT services firms is pursuing a wide range of potential blockchain applications.  N Chandrasekaran, CEO of Tata Consultancy Service (TCS), remarked on that work during an interview with Indian newspaper The Economic Times. According to the transcript, Chandrasekaran said that the firm is involved in ""more than 100"" blockchain prototypes, the result of a process that has played out over the past year and a half.  He remarked:  ""Companies are doing this differently, in different pieces. If you take financial services, there is a lot of excitement about blockchain. So, we are trying to see how we can effectively use blockchain to bring a real-time behaviour between (multiple) nodes in a financial process.""  TCS, which employs more than 300,000 individuals worldwide, further said in a note to investors that it is exploring applications for blockchain in cross-border payments, trade finance and digital identity.  While Chandrasekaran's comments constitute the broadest look at the Tata's work with blockchain to date, it's not the first. Last year, Visa indicated that it was looking to work with the consultancy on blockchain, and the firm has also reportedly worked with Dutch bank ABN Amro on developing proofs-of-concept.  Still, the remarks come amid a brightening climate for blockchain applications within India's financial sector, which is a likely source of at least some of the projects in which Tata is involved.  Chandrasekaran went on to say that the process by which technology is evolving in the IT space, ""it’s not just replacing the old, it’s opening up new possibilities"".  ""If you ask me two or four quarters away, 'Do you see a blockchain practice producing a billion dollars next year?' I can't answer the question,"" he continued. ""We are on the forefront.""

42399415,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj72y,1476803510,European Central Bank Pushes for Tighter Digital Currency Control,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has urged its members to impose tighter controls on the activities of companies that exchange virtual currencies or custody them for their clients.  The comments come as the European Union moves toward extending the economic bloc's anti-money laundering statutes to cover digital currency activities. At the same time, the ECB has been conducting its own investigations of both digital currencies like bitcoin as well as its underlying technology.  Perhaps most notable in the ECB’s legal opinion, publishedhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/legal/pdf/en_con_2016_49_f_sign.pdf earlier this week, is its assertion that the broader adoption of digital currencies ""could in principle affect the central banks’ control over the supply of money"" and impact its role in seeking price stability.  The ECB states:  ""Thus, while it is appropriate for the Union legislative bodies, consistent with the FATF’s recommendations, to regulate virtual currencies from the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing perspectives, they should not seek in this particular context to promote a wider use of virtual currencies.""  The opinion paper isn't the first instance in which the ECB has sought to question the impact of digital currencies. Last year, the central bank described them as ""inherently unstable"", while at the same time making the argument that the technology could have an impact on future monetary policymaking.  ""Although [virtual currency system] units are not denominated in euro, they do have the potential to have an impact on monetary policy and price stability, financial stability and the smooth operation of payment systems in the euro area,"" the ECB said at the time.

42399424,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj78s,1476799215,Symbiont Unveils ‘Assembly’ Blockchain for Enterprise,"As financial institutions look to move beyond proofs-of-concept, the speed at which available blockchain solutions can process transactions is expected to play a deciding factor in adoption.  In preparation for that shift, New York startup Symbiont today publicly launched its Assembly blockchain. Previously only hinted at in a demos, the blockchain solution is already being implemented by Symbiont partners including the state of Delaware and Credit Suisse.  Coming in at 87,000 transactions per second during a live test on four nodes, the Assembly blockchain (or dedicated distributed ledger, as Symbiont describes it) appears to be capable of transacting at more than 10k times the speed of the bitcoin blockchain, even if it isn’t quite up to speed with Nasdaq's reported capacity.  Symbiont co-founder and CTO Adam Krellenstein, however, said the system has reached transaction speeds that even surpass those claimed by VisaNet in a recent report.  Krellenstein told CoinDesk:  ""We fully expect our competitors and other developers in the industry to be able to reach comparable numbers in the future. But it's a question of time and what sacrifices they have to make.""  Symbiont's own building process has required design modifications, as well.  Originally, Symbiont's smart contract system ran on the bitcoin blockchain, but as the use-cases became increasingly complicated, the company said a tailored solution was needed to give customers both a private solution and faster transactions times.  Today, Symbiont’s smart contract system is capable of supporting a wide-range of blockchains including Hyperledger and ethereum.  The private, immutable Assembly network of distributed nodes is managed by Symbiont’s clients, which pay a fee to license the software. Powered by the BFT Smart consensus algorithm, Assembly also generates revenue by charging additional fees to originate new investment vehicles (more details are now available on Symbiont's Github site).  The fee-based business model is designed to relegate Symbiont to the role of a gate-keeper that protects the on-ramp to the system and ensures only regulated users participate.  Rapid deployment  To simplify implementation of the smart contracts across numerous blockchains, Symbiont employs a process called containerization.  Instead of having to build a different smart contract implementation for each blockchain, Sybmiont breaks down its code into modules and uses containerization provider Docker's software to rapidly deploy a single set of code for multiple ledgers.  To manage the containers, Symbiont uses Google’s open-source Kubernetes service. The result is that a single node on Assembly can run multiple ledgers, increasing the system's overall reliability.  Whereas Krellenstein argues that many of his competitors are building proofs-of-concept on a case-by-case basis, he says Assembly's method of combining a streamlined consensus mechanism and containerized code lets his company model ""arbitrarily complex financial instruments"" and deploy them ""in various industries to great effect.""  ""As we've built proofs of concept, we've been able to do so incredibly quickly,"" said Krellenstein. ""And that’s because we built our system with a powerful generic platform.""  Symbiont isn't currently sharing its revenue numbers, but to give an idea of its growth, the company currently employs 17 people and Krellenstein says they just signed a lease for space to accommodate eight additional employees.  Though Krellenstein's take on his product is understandably bullish given his vested interest, multiple ostensible competitors have also been making strides in the move away from blockchain proofs-of-concept to functioning services.  For example, earlier today, New York-based Axoni announced a deal with JP Morgan, Thompson Reuters and others that resulted in over 100 successful tests of complex blockchain based equity swaps.  Further, the US Patent & Trademark Office recently published an application from New York-based Digital Asset Holdings for a means to execute similar trades.  Battle-tested  While today is the coming-out party for Symbiont's Assembly blockchain the startups that has raised $7m venture capital has been discreetly shopping its offering to potential customers for a while.  In March of this year, Symbiont partnered with Goldman Sachs and Blackstone subsidiary Ipreo to launch a jointly held venture call Synaps Loans to create Assembly-based syndicated loans offerings.  Two months later, the State of Delaware announced it would partner with Symbiont to move the process of registering companies, tracking shares and managing shareholder communications into a digital environment we now know is the Assembly blockchain.  In fact, for several months now, Symbiont has been running the Assembly blockchain with multiple entities, and after a recent demo, the firm’s new president says a ""deluge"" of interest has followed.  Symbiont president Caitlin Long said she took 22 meetings with fellow attendees at Oliver Wyman’s InsurTech conference in Las Vegas earlier this month, a figure she asserted is a sign of the company's success.  Long concluded:  ""We are engaging with nearly every major insurance company in the US and many in Europe, but it's still early.""

42399420,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj75v,1476793968,Blockchain Biometrics Startup Raises $3 Million in New Funding,"A startup aiming to bridge the worlds of blockchain tech and biometric security has raised $3m in new funding.  HYPR raised the funds from RTP Ventures, Boldstart Ventures and Mesh Ventures. The funding round comes just under two years after the startup closed a $350,000 private investment, while at the time pitching itself as a means to secure bitcoin transactions with the help of a fingerprint.  According to George Avetisov, CEO of HYPR, the majority of the funds will be used to build out the startup’s development team, based primarily in New York.  Avetisov said of the funding round:  ""As traditional identity verification measures continue to fail, we are witnessing significant enterprise validation of the biometric security space. This signifies a tipping point in mass adoption of secure password-less authentication.""  The concept of using biometric signatures to add an additional security layer for transactions involving bitcoin or other kinds of digital, blockchain-based assets has attracted interest in the past.  While not the only area of focus for HYPR – the startup is also pitching its technology for broader use in IoT and cloud computing applications – it's an area that some advocates have said could play a role in developing means for putting identity on the blockchain.

42399404,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj6x4,1476761288,"JP Morgan, Credit Suisse Among 8 in Latest Bank Blockchain Test","Eight financial firms have completed a successful test of a smart contract prototype built by blockchain startup Axoni.  Announced today, participating institutions include five banks (JP Morgan, Credit Suisse, Barclays, Citi and one undisclosed participant), two financial infrastructure firms (Markit and Thomson Reuters) and business consultancy Capco.  The months-long equity swaps processing tests were organized by Axoni to show that the New York firm's software is capable of handling complex post-trade services such as margin payments and corporate action processing. Further, the project was designed to automate the time-consuming lifecycle management and synchronization tasks behind single stock, index and portfolio swaps.      Though Axoni has already announced two multi-party blockchain prototypes this year, today's news is being positioned as a step forward for the emerging startup.  Axoni CEO Greg Schvey said in a statement that the tests demonstrate how a blockchain can be used to increase the efficiency of even some of the more complicated post-trade asset services.  Schvey said:    ""Complex contracts, a distributed market structure, and replicated workflows across many parties make blockchain technology a natural fit for equity derivatives.""    The increasing complexity of the tests is part of a larger industry-wide push to move blockchain applications past prototype hype into real-world implementations.              Multiple data sources  To conduct the OTC equity swaps tests, Thomson Reuters first integrated its ethereum-based BlockOne hosted wallet with Axoni's software. The integration provided the group valuations and market data such as equity prices and LIBOR rates.  Smart contracts were then generated using information analysis firm IHS Markit's MarkitSERV processing platform, giving the banks a ""synchronized, golden record"" of transactions, a statement said.  To supplement the expertise of each of the project members, Axoni asked that Capco review each work-flow from beginning to end to ensure there were no redundancies.  Capco's managing principal and blockchain lead Benjamin Jessel told CoinDesk:  ""We’re using smart contracts in a far more sophisticated way than what has been done in the past.""  In total, 133 structured test cases assessed the capabilities of blockchain technology equity derivatives with a 100% success rate, according to the statement.  In addition to testing the functionality of the smart contracts, the working group conducted 50 tests of the underlying Axoni Core infrastructure.

42399407,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj6v6,1476758785,Hopes Are High Tomorrow's Ethereum Fork Won't Be Like the Last,"Nothing to see here...  That's the message from developers, entrepreneurs and analysts ahead of an upgrade to the ethereum network that aims to solve ""urgent network health issues"".  The new code, expected to be released tomorrow morning, follows a series of attacks that developers say exposed issues with the pricing model the network uses to discourage transaction spam. As a result, the ethereum community is set to adopt a patch for the issue at block 2,463,000 on its main blockchain, a move developers believe will reprice network functions to better incentivize intended use.  A second hard fork is then expected to remove the spam that resulted from the attacks, though details on this update are still forthcoming. (A full FAQ has been posted by the Ethereum Foundation here).  But while expected in light of recent issues, the changes are the subject of heightened interest given the fallout surrounding a problematic hard fork this summer. Prompted by an attack on a prominent application, the community elected to restore investor funds through a protocol change that invalidated the alleged theft.  What followed, however, was a prolonged – and still active – disagreement that saw that a group of developers continue to write code for and process transactions on the abandoned blockchain. Dubbed ethereum classic, the alternative network is continuing to attract developers and trader interest.  But despite this backdrop, analysts don't see tomorrow's hard fork as one that will yield similar results given that it will improve the experience for users.  Developer Demian Brenner, an entrepreneur building a smart contract platform called Zeppelin on ethereum, said there was broad agreement among his users that this fork would be a non-event.  Brenner told CoinDesk:  ""'Forking' is presented as a super scary concept, but in any other field it would just be called 'upgrading'. Contentious hard forks ... are legitimately troubling, but non-contentious forks are a good thing, they're how the platform is built and improved.""  So far, analysts said that key portions of the ethereum ecosystem have already signaled support.  As for the upgrading process, Jonathan Toomim, who runs a hosted mining operation that serves ethereum miners, said he had already upgraded his machines to clients that are ready to switch over to the new code when it is deployed.  Customers of the major ethereum exchange Poloniex were similarly advised that the startup would quickly adopt the new blockchain to ensure its services aren’t interrupted.  Attacker risk  At issue, the non-profit leading ethereum's development said, is an economic imbalance that tomorrow's fork will resolve.  ""The attacker performed a DoS attack by repeatedly calling certain operation codes (opcodes) in their smart contracts that are computationally difficult for clients to process, but very cheap to add to the network,"" a blog post on the fork reads.  But while the fork will solve for one proven method of attack, analysts are unsure of whether this fix will solve for another problem – the resolve of the attacker or attackers seeking to disrupt the network.  As detailed previously in CoinDesk, the attacks coincided with the start of a major ethereum developer conference and were seen by many as a willful attempt to express disdain over the July hard fork.  To this point, observers aren't exactly sure the fix will stop the attacker.  ""The bigger risk is that the mysterious attacker has something more damaging up his or her sleeve, like actually robbing contracts rather than just this childish [spam attack],"" digital currency hedge fund operator Jacob Eliosoff told CoinDesk.  Still, not everyone saw this as an issue.  Other market participants were quick to caution that the ethereum platform remains in its early stages, and that, despite expectations, it is still months and years away from being ""production ready"".  According to Toomim, it's better for the attacks to continue on the basis that any new issues could be identified and resolved.  ""I would rather it be production ready than seem production ready,"" he said. ""If there are bugs or flaws, I would prefer that they be revealed before a lot of dapps are deployed.""  Changing costs  In other areas, analysts indicated that they found little potential risk in the fork.  For example, even though the change will increase the costs of some network functions, Brener said Zeppelin's community doesn't expect smart contract development to be impacted.  “The hard fork mainly changes gas costs of certain operations, so developers will need to be careful when using those. We haven't seen any big changes in development style yet but time will tell,"" he said.  Dominik Zynis, a marketing advisor at WINGS, a decentralized ethereum platform for the creation of DAOs, said his platform had already shifted its focus to bitcoin smart contracts following the last hard fork.  ""We do plan to support ethereum and ethereum classic, and are indeed pleased to see this hard fork tis addressing security issues,"" he said.  Still, Zynis's comments pointed to the broader optimism that the hard fork would proceed without issue, mitigating the chance that further competing blockchains would fragment the developer ecosystem.  He concluded:  ""As long as hard forks do not produce more competing blockchains, this is a non-event for us.""
