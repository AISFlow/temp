42431006,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzCth,1569530708,Spencer Dinwiddie Could Decentralize Pro Sports – If Accredited Investors Want In,"UPDATE (Sept. 28, 9:08 UTC): The New York Times reported Friday that the NBA says Dinwiddie can't sell shares of his contract, citing the current collective bargaining agreement with the NBA Players Association. The Players Association declined to comment to the Times. Dinwiddie said he plans to meet with NBA officials.      Accredited investors can soon indulge their hoop dreams.  In partnership with crypto firm Paxos, NBA guard Spencer Dinwiddie is looking to raise $13.5 million by tokenizing the first year of his three-year, $34.5 million contract.  Dubbed the DREAM Fan Shares platform, investors in the securities offering will earn interest through Dinwiddie’s bi-monthly paycheck. The minimum buy-in is $150,000.  The guard for the Brooklyn Nets told CoinDesk that his contract is fully guaranteed, meaning investors do not risk losing their funds if he is injured or otherwise unable to play. He is set to earn $16 million this season, trading $2.5 million in earnings for the certainty of an upfront payment.  While the initial token offering is only set for this first season, Dinwiddie said in an interview with CoinDesk that he would include an option for token holders to continue their investments through the second and third years of his current contract.  ""Essentially, you hold the token and it’s kind of a marker,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""They all represent shares in the issuance so it’s not like ownership [of the player] or something like that, it’s contractual value.""  In return, DREAM Fan Shares investors receive SD8 tokens, named for Dinwiddie’s initials and number. Only accredited investors – those with a net worth of at least $1 million or income of at least $200,000 in each of the last two years – can participate in the token sale.  Paxos Trust Company will provide custody and escrow services for the project, paying token holders by way of its dollar-pegged stablecoin, the Paxos Standard (PAX).  Entertainment tokens  The NBA player says the new platform is designed to help athletes and other individuals in the entertainment industry take advantage of their earnings.  ""Every asset class has its associated fixed-income products attached to it and when you look at the NBA, you look at the entertainment as a whole. These are brokers,"" Dinwiddie explained, adding:  ""The brokers kind of determine the value of the assets, the assets are revenue-generating vehicles, which is us. … It’s not the value of our intellectual property, it’s us going out and playing every night … and helping the league out.""  However, Dinwiddie believes that players – and other individuals in different industries – will remain more financially secure in the long term if they’re able to build a business around their efforts. Creating a new asset class through his token platform would help with this.  Individuals whose contracts are not fully guaranteed (as is the case in the NFL) should also still be incentivized to fulfill the terms, rather than running off with the money after they complete their raise, Dinwiddie said.  Anyone who does decide to retire would have to refund investors and would likely ruin their future career prospects, he said, concluding:  ""I would have to give back all that money and then end my career and leave with zero money.""  Future-proofing  Dinwiddie, who played three years at the University of Colorado before declaring for the NBA draft, sees tokenizing assets as a way of preparing for a potential global recession. Because the tokens would not be tied to the legacy financial system, they may well be recession-resistant, he said.  (""Not, of course, if the NBA goes out of business, but I don't think that’s going to happen,"" Dinwiddie clarified.)  Recession concerns aside, simply by receiving a portion of his contract upfront – rather than in installments throughout the season, as he would normally be paid – Dinwiddie said he will be able to invest his payment into some sort of vehicle, which should in turn ultimately lead to a larger return for him.  ""If you go from two-grand to 20-grand a month and you can’t touch it, then you’re [set] for life,"" he said, adding:  ""There’s been some interest from a lot of different guys around the league. I think if my [plan] is successful you’ll see a lot of guys open up to it and might have a lot more crypto influence to it.""  Other players would be able to customize their own respective tokens. Dinwiddie envisions a system where an investor would be able to trade, for example, one of his tokens for a token based on the far more lucrative contracts of Kevin Durant (four years, $164 million, also with the Nets) or Lebron James (four years, $154 million, with the Los Angeles Lakers).  ""The Fan Shares platform has all this stuff in mind,"" he said.  Furthermore, athletes wouldn’t be the only individuals able to set up such tokens. Dinwiddie believes an individual from any entertainment industry should be able to set up a similar token, even if specific details about their respective contracts vary.  Using a blockchain-based platform would help assure investors of what they’re buying into, he said, adding:  ""I think blockchain lets us do that more [efficiently], it’s more transparent. No one’s going to think we’re going to run off with their money.""

42431014,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzD5h,1569524402,Why Ethereum Briefly Overtook Bitcoin in Daily Transaction Fees,"Ethereum transaction fees are back on the rise and gaining parity with bitcoin transaction fees.  As seen in data charts provided by blockchain analytics firm CoinMetrics, ethereum surpassed bitcoin in daily transaction fees on Sept. 21. While ethereum has since been maintaining a close parity with bitcoin’s daily transaction fees, bitcoin currently beats out ethereum at roughly $350,000 in fees per day.  Granted, bitcoin trading volume has been experiencing a slump as of late June, falling from $1.32 million to below $300,000 across major cryptocurrency exchanges, according to data from Bitconity.org. Bitcoin’s market value is also tanking in recent days dropping from a high of $8,500 to below $8,000 on Thursday.  However, this slump isn’t expected to last forever, with many cryptocurrency day traders such as Eric Choe noting that transaction fee volumes should pick up again in coming months as trading for the asset begins to increase.  “I do believe this is a temporary thing,” said Choe. “Historically, bitcoin transaction fees have been higher. I do think this is more a temporary fixation of the markets right now.”  Choe added that part of the reason for a surge in ethereum transaction fees has been the recent increase in trading activity surrounding dollar-pegged stablecoin Tether (USDT).  Since 2018  , USDT has been trading on ethereum, as well as on the bitcoin-based Omni Layer Protocol. Over the course of 2019, however, the ethereum version of Tether has been surpassing the Omni Protocol version by some metrics.  “The Ethereum version of Tether hit a new all-time high of 187,912 daily transactions on September 9th,” CoinMetrics reported in a Sept. 17 newsletter, adding:  “USDT-ETH is generating so many transactions that it recently accounted for over 25% of all Ethereum transactions on September 8th, and has consistently accounted for more than 10% of all Ethereum transactions since mid-August.”  According to Tether’s official website, there is roughly $2 billion worth of USDT currently issued on the ethereum platform. In December of last year, there was only a reported $60 million.  Calling this the “rise of Tether” on ethereum, TM Lee, co-founder of cryptocurrency data aggregator CoinGecko, said the spike in Tether’s popularity is likely due to the migration of users from Omni to ethereum.  “This is likely due to the gradual switch of USDT support from Omni to Ethereum in most exchanges, especially Binance, which made the [switch] sometime in July 2019,” Ong said via email.  Financial markets director at cryptocurrency exchange OKEx Lennix Lai added:  “The shift is potentially beneficial to the Ethereum ecosystem since it shall decrease fiction for the most-used stablecoin in the world integrating into the open finance space. However, with USDT clogging the Ethereum network, it means other developers have to encounter a spike of cost on computation power in Ethereum.""  Poking fun  In order to prevent network congestion, miners on the ethereum network have recently responded to the surge in transaction activity by increasing ethereum’s “gas limit.”  Stepping back, the cost to send a transaction on the ethereum network is called gas and paid in fractions of ETH called gwei. For every block processed on the ethereum blockchain, there is a limit to the overall amount of gas that can be collected by miners.  In short, a higher gas limit means that a higher number of transactions can be included in a block. On Sept. 19, ethereum miners collectively raised network gas limits from 8 million to 10 million gwei.  Ethereum blocks are now effectively 25 percent larger – allowing for larger transaction processing loads.  At the same time, the concern around larger block sizes on ethereum is that block propagation speed may slow down. The slower it is for a block to be propagated and accepted by all miners in the ethereum network, the higher the likelihood is for temporary chain splits to occur.  “As gas limit goes up, block size will eventually follow it, requiring more storage and initial sync time for nodes,” said Eric Conner, founder of ethereum information site ETHHub. “So far though, block size hasn’t really gone up despite the gas limit increasing.”  Even so, some outside of the ethereum community have viewed the collective decision-making of miners on the platform with derision.  “It’s official! Ethereum miners have unilaterally increased the gas limit and made it even harder to sync a full node,” tweeted self-proclaimed bitcoin maximalist Conner Brown. “Meanwhile ethereans rejoice at how easy it was for miners to do this without public debate.”  However, there is still room for public debate, according to ethereum core developer Alexey Akhunov, who says he’d like to better understand the effects of this gas limit increase.  “I would like to analyse whether this increase in the gas limit by 25 percent has accelerated the [ethereum] state growth by 25 percent, or by a lower percentage,” Akhunov said, adding:  “I do not know yet but we shall see soon.”  Ethereum and bitcoin image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,ETH | USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TRADING | USDT,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/26/why-ethereum-briefly-overtook-bitcoin-in-daily-transaction-fees,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/82d1ac2a0c63d57abe5b32aa532d51b7470dbed7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Some involve the participation of major companies and groups – including one with a Sony connection – though most of the activity centers around testing, development agreements and pilot projects.  In early September, SK Securities, a listed Korean brokerage until recently a member of the SK Group, and Kasa Korea agreed to form a venture for the creation of blockchain platform that will allow for the issuing and trading of fractional ownership in property assets, according to a report from Yonhap News.  Kasa Korea  was in the first group of 18 companies chosen by the Financial Service Commission, Korea's main financial regulator, for a so-called regulatory sandbox, whereby normal regulations are lifted in order to allow for innovation.  Also in early September, JLL Japan said that it would be working with a number of companies, including Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, to develop a digital platform for the recording and management of real estate data. In a pilot, the project will be testing whether the blockchain can be used to centralize income and expense information related to real estate property management.  Later in the month, SRE AI, a company controlled by Sony and partly owned by Yahoo Japan, said that it would be joining a Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank-led project that is working to create a blockchain platform for the facilitation of real estate transactions. The project began earlier in the year and has already moved from the first stage.  On Sept. 24, Tsubai Space, a Japanese real estate blockchain company, and Shinonome Advisors, a real estate firm specializing in law and tax and working with property securitization, said they would be jointly developing a token for the real estate market. The announcement was short on detail, with the companies saying only that the project had been privately discussed in Taiwan in July and would be formally announced in early October.

Bloomberg wrote on Wednesday that the governor of the British central bank had argued last month that a Libra-like ""Synthetic Hegemonic Currency,"" best provided by the public sector, would help end the dominance of the dollar as the global reserve currency. It would, he proposed, also be a better option than another fiat currency, such as the yuan, ultimately replacing USD.  “In the longer term, we need to change the game. ... When change comes, it shouldn’t be to swap one currency hegemon for another,” Carney said in a speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium 2019. He will step down from his BoE role in January 2020.  The Libra project, led by Facebook and backed by a group of 28 major firms including Uber, PayPal and Visa, aims to launch a stablecoin representing a basket of fiat currencies and government bonds.  Responding to Carney, Simon Potter, who was until recently executive vice president and head of the Markets Group at the New York Fed, said that the case had ""no argument"" to support it and doesn't take into account the benefits of the dollar's international role.  At an event in New York yesterday, Potter stated:  “I see no argument that makes sense to have something that complicated out there when you have large, liquid capital markets in the U.S.. Not having one currency that you can basically price things and have a deep market in, that makes life much harder for the global economy.”  While it's probably unlikely that the central banks of would work together on a shared digital currency, Potter said there's the risk that private firms will – and that should be a ""concern"" to central banks.  While national monetary sovereignty is “designed to protect people and get good outcomes, companies are ""much more interested in selling products,” he argued.

42431001,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzChh,1569502856,Bittrex Adopts Chainalysis KYT Software to Flag Suspicious Activity,"Bittrex, the U.S. crypto exchange, has adopted blockchain compliance firm Chainalysis’ real-time monitoring software for transactions to flag suspicious activity across many of its leading coins, Bittrex executives told CoinDesk.  Bitcoin, ETH, bitcoin cash, litecoin, dai, gemini, among other cryptocurrencies traded on Bittrex are covered by the new software, known as Chainalysis KYT (Know Your Transaction).  Bittrex’s adoption of Chainalysis KYT comes as governments and regulators around the world are increasing their oversight of crypto exchanges. In June, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) gave the exchanges of its 37 member countries 12 months to begin tracking complete customer details on every transaction handled.  Though Bittrex was already in compliance with similar U.S. regulations, Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer John Roth said Chainalysis KYT goes further. Its built-in knowledge base of suspicious addresses — “dark net sites, child exploitation sites” — puts Bittrex a step ahead, he said.  “Having real-time information coming in from which we can make risk decisions is really an amazing step forward, and frankly one that’s not available to traditional financial institutions,” Roth said.  Jonathan Levin, Chainalysis’ chief security officer, said KYT automates much of Bittrex’s review process.  “The key to supporting a large exchange like Bittrex is building features that enable them to automate their compliance process, prioritize their workflow, and customize their alerts to speed up how fast they can do due diligence,” Levin said.  Automation helps high-volume exchanges retain compliance “sustainability” -- the capacity to identify a handful of suspicious transactions among millions of otherwise banal crypto trades.  The software flags the most likely criminal transactions, but a Bittrex-employed compliance analyst still needs to determine if the threat is valid and then file a suspicious activity report with regulators.  Bittrex ethics chief Roth said the new software is a response to the crypto space’s development and maturation as financial institutions explore exchange-based trades.  “They need to be assured that we are doing things the right way.”  Code image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/26/bittrex-adopts-chainalysis-kyt-software-to-flag-suspicious-activity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a05f512888bd6503b5d4c35cfb4cea119eb0cbcb-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Flexa  , a startup making it easier to use crypto for purchases in the real world, will be an advisory participant in a new demonstration store at America's largest mall, which is located outside Minneapolis, Minn.  The store, meant to showcase new brands and technologies for enhancing the retail experience, is being organized by management consulting firm McKinsey.  ""The big thing for us is showing that cryptocurrency is an extremely legitimate if not the best form of digital payment,"" Flexa CEO Tyler Spalding told CoinDesk in an interview, adding:  ""This is going to show the legitimacy of how this stuff works.""  The store – called Modern Retail Collective – will test out retail technology under real conditions. Starting Friday morning, the goal will be to help retailers understand which new technologies really add value. With some 8,000 U.S. brick-and-mortar stores closing this year alone, according to a press release from McKinsey, the question of generating value has taken on a new sense of urgency.  “Through this project, we’ll produce cutting-edge data and analytics to help retailers define their own vision for their store of the future,"" McKinsey's Praveen Adhi said in a statement.  Crypto at the mall  Flexa's Spalding noted that McKinsey advises companies large enough that very modest cost savings can turn into real money across large chains.  ""We're able to have a solution that makes the consumer experience better and it achieves that kind of goal right out of the gate,"" Spalding said.  Other non-crypto technologies will also be demonstrated in the store, including FaceCake (augmented reality), Chatter Research (conversational AI) and ComQi (digital signage). Square will also be participating in the store as a payments system, but without using its bitcoin technology, a spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk.  The Flexa payment app, SPEDN, allows for instant payment with cryptocurrency because every transaction is guaranteed by a stake in Flexa's FXC token. Flexa is backed by Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.  Flexa created this functionality so that other wallets could set themselves up as payment apps using Flexa's technology, too. As those partners come online, they will also be able to make purchases at the demo store.  Spalding said that Flexa will have a significant footprint at the store, with staff there trained to show people how to use the SPEDN app and get cryptocurrency onto it. Spalding expects some of the retailers to offer small discounts for using crypto for payments because it offers them certain advantages.  ""Zero fraud,"" Spalding promised. ""No chargebacks.""  Discounts or no, SPEDN will be one of the payment options on offer at every retailer in the collective, Spalding told us.  The store will be open at least through the holidays, Spalding said.  After the demonstration closes, Flexa looks forward to the data McKinsey plans to publish.

42431012,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzD3h,1569496014,Bitcoin May See Brief Bounce After Defending Key Price Support,"View  Bitcoin is defending the key 200-day moving average support for the third consecutive day and may see a minor bounce to $8,700.  A corrective bounce, if any, will likely be short-lived, as the daily and weekly chart indicators are biased bearish. The cryptocurrency will remain on the hunt for a drop to $7,500, as discussed yesterday, as long as the resistance at $9,097 is intact.  A break above $9,097 is needed to weaken the bearish case. A stronger sign of bearish invalidation would be a move above the weekly chart resistance at $9,533.      Bitcoin's repeated defense of key support may yield a minor bounce, however, the bias will remain bearish as long as prices are held below resistance near $9,100.  The top cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell more than 10 percent on Tuesday, confirming a bullish-to-bearish trend change and opening the doors for a deeper slide to $7,500.  So far, however, dips below the crucial 200-day moving average (MA) line have been short-lived. BTC is currently trading around $8,440 on Bitstamp, having found takers below the long-term average at $8,332 earlier today.  The cryptocurrency printed a low of $7,998 on Tuesday but closed (UTC) above the 200-day MA, then located at $8,288. Similar price action was seen on Wednesday with sellers failing to secure a close below the long-term support.  Bitcoin resistance could entice bargain hunters. After all, the MA is widely considered a barometer of a long-term trend. The cryptocurrency is set to be in a bull market if its charting higher lows above the 200-day MA, while lower lows below the MA represent bearish conditions.  While a corrective bounce could be seen in the next 24 hours or so, the bearish outlook would be invalidated only if prices find acceptance above $9,097 (May 30 high).  Daily chart  Bitcoin's 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is reporting oversold conditions with a below-50 reading.  Note that overbought/oversold indicators gain credence only when the price is showing signs of buyer/seller exhaustion.  The cryptocurrency is defending the 200-day MA for the third straight day, a sign of temporary seller exhaustion. Hence, an oversold bounce to highs above $8,700 cannot be ruled out.  The bounce, however, could be short-lived, as the MACD histogram continues to produce deeper bars below the zero line, meaning the bearish momentum is still quite strong. Further, the 50- and 100-day MAs have produced a bearish crossover.  Tuesday's drop below the higher low of $9,097 created on May 30 confirmed the transition from the bullish higher lows, higher highs setup to bearish lower highs, lower lows setup.  Hence, the bias will remain bearish and the cryptocurrency will remain on the hunt for a drop below $8,000 as long as prices are trading below $9,097.  Weekly chart  As of writing, bitcoin's weekly chart is reporting a double-top bearish reversal pattern.  The cryptocurrency is currently trading well below the double top neckline of $9,533 and loss set to end the week (Sunday, UTC) below that level, as the relative strength index has turned bearish below 50 for the first time since the end of March.  The MACD histogram is also reporting bearish conditions with a below-zero print.  The double top breakout, a bearish reversal pattern, would be invalidated if prices rise back above $9,533.

42430994,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzCXh,1569493806,Coinbase Now Supports Stellar and Chainlink Cryptocurrencies in New York,"Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced that New York residents now have access to two cryptocurrencies launched for other jurisdictions months ago.  In two tweets late on Wednesday, the exchange said customers based in New York state can now hold, buy, sell, send and receive both Stellar lumens (XLM) and Chainlink's LINK token. The cryptos will now be available on Coinbase.com and the exchange's iOS and Android apps in the state.  XLM had previously been launched in most jurisdictions on Coinbase back in March, while LINK followed in June. The high regulatory hurdles set in New York were likely behind the delays in adding support.  LINK is an ethereum-based token used to power Chainlink's decentralized network. An API bridging service, Chainlink connects smart contract platforms – like decentralized finance products – to oracles containing real market data and event information.  In a CoinDesk video interview on Thursday, the project's CEO said that offering secure smart contracts pegged to real-world events is the next “leap forward” in boosting corporate adoption of blockchain technology.  Stellar, meanwhile, is designed as a crypto-based payment system using its XLM token. The project has notably partnered with IBM on its World Wire payments network, announced this time last year.

42431010,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzCxh,1569492015,The New Medici Bank Is About to Take On Its First Crypto Clients,"A new crypto-friendly bank with a historic pedigree is about to take on its first clients.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Medici Bank is launching into private beta in October. The Puerto Rico-based bank will be testing the digital onboarding process, web portals and its application programming interface with five companies from around the globe.  Two or three of those companies will be crypto businesses and at least one of them will be an exchange, Ed Boyle, CEO of Medici, told CoinDesk. Such firms are instructive to bring on during a testing phase to see if the bank’s systems can scale to accommodate trading volumes.  “Crypto companies are high-throughput types of clients,” Ed Boyle, CEO of Medici, said. “If we can handle that, we can handle anything.”  Founded by Prince Lorenzo de’ Medici, a descendant of the Renaissance-era Italian banking family, Medici Bank will join the short list of financial institutions that welcoming to crypto companies.  Most banks are loath to serve the sector because the perceived risk of money laundering makes compliance expensive relative to the revenue generated by the account. The handful of U.S. banks willing to bank crypto firms includes Silvergate in California and Signature, Metropolitan Commercial and Quontic Bank in New York. Fidor Bank in Germany, whose U.S. operations Boyle used to oversee, also has crypto clients.  “There are [fewer] than 10 banks on the entire planet that are crypto-friendly,” Boyle said.  $1 billion goal  By the end of the year, Medici bank will go into open beta, a not fully operational environment with a restricted number of users. The bank plans to fully launch in the first quarter of 2020 with a goal of $1 billion in combined deposits and assets under management within three years.  Medici aims to have a clientele split evenly between fintech companies (including crypto businesses), import-export companies and private wealth clients, “but don’t know when we’ll achieve something that looks like parity,” Boyle said. “Just as fighters have a plan until they get punched in the mouth and no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy, we fully expect our plans to adjust greatly after we get to market.”  While the bank’s appetite for banking crypto companies is not limitless, Medici is willing to have up to a third or half of its total business be crypto clients, Boyle said.  Licensed as an International Financial Entity (IFE) by Puerto Rico’s Office of the Commission of Financial Institutions, Medici Bank has six employees and plans to have 20 by the end of this year, 50 by the end of 2020 and 100 by the end of 2021.  Meantime, Boyle is working with third-party companies, which he wouldn’t name, to enable Medici to analyze blockchain data. Looking at the movement of funds on a public ledger, Boyle argues, is more effective than traditional ways of detecting suspicious activity.  “It’s a heck of a lot easier to analyze a blockchain than it is to analyze a paycheck,” he said. “In banking crypto-related companies, we don’t have to make assumptions, we just figure out what the wallet address is and analyze the history of that wallet address.”  And in the longer term, Medici aims to use blockchain technology itself.  Broader ambition  Ultimately, Medici’s goal is to decentralize banking, Boyle said.  To that end, he is in talks with digital banks around the globe about creating a network with multiple interoperable blockchains to facilitate instant sharing of know-your-customer information, identity transportability, real-time cross border payments and account transfers.  Digital banks are generally defined as any provider of banking services without branches, serving clients only through mobile apps or the web. Boyle, however, reserves the term for providers “with actual licenses, not prepaid cards that ride on top of some legacy bank” – a dig at fintech startups that have traditional banks enabling their services on the back end.  Each of these banks would run a node on the blockchain network and would have access to local payment rails in those geographies. Currently, only large centralized foreign exchange desks can enable cross-border transactions between large banks, Boyle said. Medici’s blockchain network aims to allow small digital banks to work around those larger institutions, he said.  Banks that have made splashy announcements about using blockchains for settlements of internal client transfers are not truly using a blockchain because they only involve one node, Boyle argued. With multiple nodes run by separate banks, the participants in Medici’s proposed network could trust the blockchain as an immutable system of record.  “It only makes sense to deploy a blockchain where you have counterparties,” Boyle said. “I’m a blockchain maximalist. Blockchain is not something that’s between Wells Fargo New York and Wells Fargo London.”  Another benefit to customers of this arrangement is that they would be able to switch accounts between participating banks in “one click,” in contrast to the rigmarole usually involved in moving one’s money to a new institution.  Frictionless switching “is anathema for banking,” Boyle said, concluding:  “Banks like to put up walled gardens and make it difficult for you to take your money elsewhere, we want to make it very easy for you to send your money elsewhere, whether it’s from one place to another or from one bank to another.”  Lion detail from the Medici-built Palazzo Pitti in Florence via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/26/the-new-medici-bank-is-about-to-take-on-its-first-crypto-clients,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9af375e9abcb93e9aeef59d526c10b93a858c1bf-1500x928.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430992,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzCTh,1569490327,Facebook's Zuckerberg Appears to Put Libra Launch Date in Doubt,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has refused to commit to the planned 2020 launch for the Libra cryptocurrency project.  Talking in interview with Nikkei on Thursday, Zuckerberg was asked about the expected date of the stablecoin's arrival, to which he replied:  ""Obviously we want to move forward at some point soon [and] not have this take many years to roll out,"" he said. ""But right now I'm really focused on making sure that we do this well.""  Since the launch of Libra's white paper in June, regulators worldwide have been strident in their objections to the project, saying it poses not only a risk to financial stability and could be used in financial crimes, but it's also a threat to sovereign currencies. Notably, lawmakers in the U.S. and France have called for the project to be halted.  The Libra project had appeared to have been sticking to its guns on the 2020 target, with Libra Association managing director and COO Bertrand Perez saying in mid September that “We are firmly maintaining our launch schedule, between the end of the first half of the year and the end of 2020.""  Zuckerberg also said that Facebook is now taking a more cautious approach when bringing forward projects like Libra that are "" very sensitive for society,"" allowing a period for consultation and ""working through the issues.""  ""That's a very different approach than what we might have taken five years ago,"" he said.  CoinDesk has reached out to the Libra Association, the non-profit set up to manage and develop the cryptocurrency, to ask if its plans had changed regarding the launch schedule. We will update this article if and when a reply is received.  In related news, David Marcus, CEO of Calibra (the entity building a digital wallet for the project), has been making the case for Libra as an improvement on traditional payment systems.  In a Medium post Wednesday, he wrote that Libra would be a ""game-changer"" for the public, arguing that ""existing 'money networks' are closed and are not well interconnected.""  They're also outdated, he said, explaining:  ""Some of these systems were built in the 1960s and 70s, and while they’ve received upgrades since then, they often live on top of legacy, fragmented infrastructure.""  The need for intermediaries in traditional methods of payment also ""means delays, and added cost at every step of the way,"" Marcus added.  Libra, on the other hand, will enable value to be moved around the world at in ""near real-time"" and at ""an incredibly low cost.""  Marcus further set out his big dream for Libra, saying:  ""Just like SMTP allowed any email provider to interoperate with other email providers, Libra can be the 'protocol' that will enable fast, cheap, and stable money movement across service providers, institutions, and people all around the world.""  This, he claimed, would reduce the costs of running payments systems, doing away with intermediaries and reducing ""operational complexity and overhead."" It would also make it easier for people to send and receive money and lower the ""barrier of access to modern digital money and financial services.""

42431002,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzClh,1569484825,WATCH: How Blockchain Oracles Could Take Chainlink to New Highs,"Chainlink CEO Sergey Nazarov says there’s one big thing holding back corporate adoption of blockchain technology: reliable oracle services that connect blockchain systems to real-world events, and vice versa.  In his mind, making blockchain-based contracts pegged to real-world events – in a reliable and secure manner – is the next “leap forward” that will launch the industry to new heights.  At CoinDesk’s Invest: Asia conference, Nazarov sat down with reporter Christine Kim to talk about the company’s plans for user adoption in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.  With new partnerships, price data feeds and privacy enhancements in the pipeline, Nazarov detailed what’s on the horizon for the now two-year-old protocol. He also addressed recent allegations of “pump-and-dump” trade activity with Chainlink’s LINK token by blockchain analytics company AnChain.ai.  Priced at a mere $0.10 during its initial crowdfunding in September 2017, the LINK token, which is used to pay node operators of the Chainlink platform, has risen over 1,000 percent, now trading at $1.70, according to CoinMarketCap.  The protocol’s market capitalization even flirted with a $1.4 billion valuation in July shortly after it was listed on cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Pro. However, since then, the token has declined significantly in value with a current market capitalization of roughly $600 million.  About the volatility in token price, Nazarov was adamant that its activity had nothing to do with the ongoing work of his team, saying:  “I think the nuance here is that crypto markets and the companies that build the technology are to a large degree separate.”  Matt Ocko, managing partner at venture capital firm Data Collective, couldn’t agree more. Data Collective seeded and remains a major investor in the startup that originated much of the Chainlink protocol. To Ocko, the LINK token, in spite of its volatility, possesses “operational value” for its holders.  “To Chainlink’s credit, they didn’t set out like some of their peers. Some folks built things on tokens that were purely speculative. Chainlink did the exact opposite,” Ocko said, adding:  “Personally, it’s my hope that this acts as a bellwether for folks who are building in this space.”  Watch the full interview with Chainlink CEO Sergey Nazarov below.  https://youtu.be/ulyI_K-TFDI  Chainlink CEO Sergey Nazarov image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,LINK,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | LINK | MARKET | TRADING,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/26/watch-how-blockchain-oracles-could-take-chainlink-to-new-highs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/824a2f50435e9f48bb9c462e5e7c7c58f898d807-1500x763.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In comments to the German federal parliament Bundestag on Wednesday, Benoit Coeure, a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB), said ""Libra has undoubtedly been a wakeup call for central banks and policymaker,"" and they should respond to these challenges.  He added that stablecoins, in particular Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency, could help connect the 1.7 billion people globally who are now off the financial grid while at the same time making cross-border payments cheaper, faster and more transparent.  In improving access and facilitating cross-border retail payments, they could address two key deficiencies in the current architecture of the market.  Libra, which is being supported by a consortium led by Facebook, will be connected to a huge existing user base, giving it a ""truly global footprint,"" according to Coeure, who chairs the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures at the Bank for International Settlements. He is also the head of the Group of Seven (G7) Committee on stablecoins.  The central banker raises a number of concerns about stablecoins. He said that they can be used for laundering money and financing terrorism, and he notes the possibility of consumer protection, data security, network stability, competition and taxation issues.  He adds that stablecoins have serious implications for monetary policy and financial stability, as the coins can have an impact on money supply outside the normal channels, while the failure of the promised peg or the loss of confidence could have systemic implications.  ""There may be the risk of the monetary sovereignty of countries being infringed,"" he was quoted as saying in written summary of his comments, which was published by the Bank of International Settlements.  While he believes that much can be done to regulate the new products within existing policy frameworks, he said that new approaches are needed. He also said rules need be applied in an ""internationally consistent"" manner, suggesting a degree of coordination between institutions globally.  In the comments, he said that the G7 group on stablecoins would be offering its recommendations in time for the IMF-World Bank meeting, which runs Oct. 14-20.
