42425330,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwAjh,1390600340,"Nobel Laureate Thinks Bitcoin is an ""Amazing"" Bubble","American economist and Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller took part in an interesting panel discussion this week about digital trends at the World Economic Forum in Davos, and naturally he mentioned bitcoin.  Shiller said bitcoin is an inspiration thanks to its geeky roots, but he warned that it is not the way forward.  In fact, despite bitcoin’s digital heritage, Shiller argued that it is a throwback to the dark ages, reports Business Insider.  Shiller’s position is understandable, since he was awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on trend-spotting in asset markets. Shiller also examined the volatility of stock prices and their correlation with dividends.  The economists and his fellow laureates Eugene F. Fama and Lars Peter Hansen found that high future returns are usually viewed as compensation for holding risky assets during risky times. The researchers also focused on departures from rational investor behaviour and its impact on asset prices. Many a bitcoin speculator would undoubtedly find Shiller’s work interesting.  Shiller is convinced bitcoin is a bubble and he is bemused by the fascination surrounding digital currencies. He said he is amazed by how people are excited by bitcoin – and bear in mind that a man who won the Nobel Prize for his work in the field of behavioural probably isn’t easy to surprise, let alone amaze. Shiller said:  ""It is a bubble, there is no question about it. ... It's just an amazing example of a bubble.""  It would be rather presumptuous to argue with a Nobel laureate, but luckily someone already did that. Back in December Forbes put Shiller’s work to the test, comparing his findings with the bitcoin bubble.  Forbes contributor Tim Worstall argued that preventing a bubble from forming in the bitcoin market is not easy, since the market is not developed and lacks many tools needed to detect a bubble.  However, Worstall said it is “more than likely” that we are in a bitcoin bubble.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/24/nobel-laureate-thinks-bitcoin-is-an-amazing-bubble,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc15c44da25c2840afe92ec36d6298fb08fa3405-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425338,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwAxh,1390594180,Video Cards Drive First-Day Sales Surge For TigerDirect,"TigerDirect's decision to begin accepting bitcoin payments has sparked ""video card madness"" at the online electronics dealer, brand manager Steven Leeds told CoinDesk.  ""Every single video card has seen a more than 50 percent spike [in sales],"" Leeds said.  Rounding out the top four items in terms of sales increases since the company's 23rd January announcement were power units, tablets and Xbox units. Further, Leeds revealed that TigerDirect's website has seen a 30% bump in traffic on the news.  The top selling item in the first day was the Sapphire Radeon R9 280X VAPOR-X, of which 30 units were sold. Leeds reported that one buyer bought nearly half - 14 - of these components.  As of press time, the item was out of stock on TigerDirect's website.  The news that TigerDirect would accept bitcoin was perhaps the biggest announcement on a day that included reveals that Fancy and Naughty America would also add bitcoin to their lists of accepted payment methods.  Leeds attributed the success to the fact that it offers products that more directly appeal to the community, as well as its more measured approach in its launch.  Timing the announcement  The latest in a string of major companies to accept bitcoin via BitPay, Leeds indicated that the decision marked an end to his company's 10-month search for a partner. Leeds said TigerDirect had initial conversations ""with several processing companies"", before selecting the Georgia-based processor.  As for the catalyst for the decision-making, Leeds noted that this is just another example of how TigerDirect not only listens to its community, but acts on its direction.  ""The community itself and our customers started asking us to look into it, and we had seen a rise in all the equipment that's used for mining. So, it was a very logical step for us to start accepting it,"" Leeds said.  The brand manager continued, comparing his company's approach to that of one of its more notable competitors in the space, Overstock.  ""As opposed to Overstock, we didn't just lock 40 engineers in a room for 10 days to be the first ones to come out with it. We really spent our time vetting companies.""  Ensuring long-term success  While TigerDirect's first-day numbers saw a big boost, Leeds said his team is already looking ahead at how it can continue to engage this customer base.  ""We understand the needs of bitcoin miners, and we plan on expanding even further our selection of mining products,"" Leeds said.  Leeds went on to tease big upcoming deals for this demographic, suggesting TigerDirect will soon be the first retailer to carry products from certain notable mining companies.  In addition, Leeds said he would look to continue to incentivize bitcoin buyers, saying that TigerDirect has already begun getting involved in the discussion on reddit, Facebook and Twitter, while hinting at big discounts to come.  ""With accepting bitcoin, there's a lot of leeway in terms of what we can offer, it happens to be the more affordable way for us to accept currency.""  Could litecoin follow?  When asked whether TigerDirect would seek out more alternative currencies, Leeds didn't shy away from his answer stating that the company ""wants to make it as easy as possible to shop"" at its store, and that bitcoin and litecoin fans are the kind of passionate customers it goes after.  ""We are a tech company and everybody in this office is a gamer, a DIYer, a tech nerd. We look to our employees on guidance on what we like to use and what we like to buy.""  Leeds noted specific action would be taken to test the waters with the litecoin community. This community, he said, should look for exclusive units in the coming weeks. Based on reaction, Leeds said TigerDirect would make the best determination for its business when deciding whether to begin accepting litecoin for payments.

42425344,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwBBh,1390590942,Bitcoin and Litecoin Top Sources of WikiLeaks Donations,"Notorious nonprofit journalistic organization WikiLeaks revealed via Twitter on 24th January that the majority of its public funding now comes through bitcoin and litecoin donations.    The tweet included a link to its official donation page, which lists major mainstream channels like American Express, MasterCard and PayPal. The organisation also accepts traditional bank transfers and Visa as other payment options.      Did you know the majority of WikiLeaks public funding is #BitCoin and #LiteCoin? https://t.co/rHPkDhfEnT More: https://t.co/X4WB1IbPdQ      — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) January 24, 2014      The message included WikiLeaks' official Blockchain.info address, which has received 3,855 BTC to date from more than 2,200 transactions.      A detailed look at WikiLeaks' payment history shows a spike in support this December when it received 56 BTC (46,444.68 USD).    Bitcoin and WikiLeaks: a history of support    The announcement demonstrates that bitcoin supporters continue to play a key role in supporting the whistleblower organisation, famous for its release of almost 400,000 documents related to US involvement and actions in the Iraq War.      This past June, WikiLeaks raised 7.18 BTC to support exiled former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee and National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked details of US government surveillance programs that caused widespread public outrage and eventually spawned contentious reform in the US.      Snowden has been living in asylum in Russia after the country granted him a one-year stay to delay his potential incarceration for the leaks in the US. The 30-year-old North Carolina native has deepened his relationship with WikiLeaks founder Assange in recent weeks, with Assange informing the press of Snowden's actions and commenting on his treatment in interviews.    Payment security    One reason virtual currency has become the preferred payment method of WikiLeaks is that it allows the organisation to circumvent traditional payment process, such as Bank of America, MasterCard, PayPal and Visa, all of which moved to block its donations in 2010, the height of its controversy.      Speaking to CoinDesk in June, Tuur Demeester, formerly of MacroTrends, elaborated on the relationship between the news agency and virtual currencies:    “WikiLeaks supporters know their donations cannot be blocked and that funds that are not used immediately will appreciate over time.”  Demeester went on to suggest that the high level of donations showed that free speech and privacy were two rights shared by bitcoin users and WikiLeaks.  As of press time, WikiLeaks received eight bitcoin donations for a total of 15.17 BTC (12,579 USD) on 24th January.

42425342,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwB7h,1390584639,Richard Branson: 6 Bitcoin Customers Confirmed for Virgin Galactic Space Flight,"Billionaire entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson has revealed a handful of people have paid in bitcoin for their place on board the Virgin Galactic spaceship.  Back in November, Branson announced his commercial space flight venture Virgin Galactic was to accept payment in bitcoins and, just two months later, ""six or seven"" people have already paid for their tickets in the digital currency.  Earlier this month, Virgin Galactic took its SpaceShipTwo on its third test flight, with the craft reaching 71,000 feet – its highest yet.  SpaceShipTwo is a consumer-ready vehicle designed to fly to the edge of space. It is partly based on the technology of SpaceShipOne, the craft that completed the first manned private spaceflight in 2004.  Advocate  Branson told CNBC he was very interested in bitcoin, but shouldn't be considered its number one advocate.  ""What I'm saying is we have a spaceship company and if people have made a lot of money out of bitcoin … we'll accept their money and send them to space,"" he added.  Speaking in Davos, Switzerland, the entrepreneur revealed he has invested some of his own money in bitcoin, however he is not 100% convinced bitcoin will be the cryptocurrency that succeeds over all others. He said:  ""I think there will be a global currency that will take on [J.P. Morgan CEO] Jamie Dimon and the other banks and other currencies. That will be the future. I suspect that if it isn't bitcoin, someone else like Square will … come up with that currency.""  Branson's comments follow an interview between CNBC and Dimon, in which the CEO said JPMorgan would be unlikely to have much to do with bitcoin.  ""The question isn't whether we accept it. The question is do we even participate [with] people who facilitate bitcoin?"" he said.  Exciting opportunity  Branson, on the other hand, is much more open to the idea of a new, dominant currency. He deems the idea of a new global currency ""very exciting"" and said, in his CNBC interview, he supports the use of a currency that doesn't require large fees and charges to move around.  ""Whoever is behind bitcoin is brilliant – it's a brilliant first step,"" he added.  Branson was later asked who he believed to be the most instrumental person in the world of business over the past 25 years.  ""I personally think Larry Page from Google, and obviously Sergey [Brin] who has worked very closely with him. They've created a formidable company. They've transformed the world in many ways,"" he replied.

42425336,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwAvh,1390581055,Investment Firm to Launch Czech Republic's First Bitcoin ATM,"Czech investment firm Marlyle has announced plans to set up the first bitcoin ATM in Prague, the Czech Republic's capital.  The company's website indicates it will launch a Robocoin machine – possibly the first one to be operated in Europe – which will allow users to purchase and sell bitcoins.  Marlyle has ordered three bitcoin ATMs from US manufacturer Robocoin Technologies, with the first one set to be located in the Smichov district of the Czech capital. The contract, signed in December last year, is worth about 1,500,000 CZK ($74,500) according to the operator.  Under the plan, Marlyle’s first bitcoin ATM is to become operational in April 2014. The locations of the remaining two machines have not been disclosed by the Czech company, but Marlyle says it will unveil further information on the project in February.  Last year, a bitcoin ATM was set up in Bratislava, in neighbouring Slovakia. However, the machine allowed its users to solely convert flat currency into bitcoins. Operated by local company 0011, and owned by IT entrepreneur Marian Jančuška, the bitcoin ATM is located in the centre of the Slovak capital.  The Lamassu machine has a ""direct connection with major stock exchanges Mt. Gox and Bitstamp"" and is fitted with an ""intuitive and simple user interface"" according to a translation from the Slovak company’s website.  Demand and supply  In late December 2013, Lamassu announced it had received over 120 orders from 25 countries “ranging from Canada to Kyrgyzstan” for their bitcoin ATMs. The manufacturer also set up an online map which shows the locations of the 100 machines the company sold in 2013.  Lamassu says on its website that a purchase of between one and four units of its bitcoin ATM generates a cost of $5,000 per piece, while buying 10 or more units diminishes the price tag to $4,000 per piece.  This means that, compared with the three machines acquired by Marlyle under the $74,500 contract, Lamassu’s small footprint machines have a lower price tag. However, the Czech company says the functionality of its Robocoin machine exceeds that of the Bratislava-based machine. Marlyle stated:  “Unlike the machine which was recently launched in Bratislava, [the machine in Prague] will allow you not only to buy bitcoins, but also to sell them.""  Martin Stránský, chief executive of Marlyle, said the country’s first Robocoin machine was part of a larger project aiming to provide a wide range of bitcoin-related services to the platform’s clients. To lure customers, the company says that qualified staff will help its clients make their first steps in the digital currency market.  “We believe that this versatile and customer-friendly service will enable digital currency trading to those people who are thinking about it today, but have been discouraged by concerns related to the safety of their investments,” he said.  Market confidence  Trust-building measures could be key to the company’s potential success in the Czech Republic.  Last year, the country’s bitcoin market was shaken by an attack which targeted Czech bitcoin exchange Bitcash.cz. In November 2013, the platform was hacked and up to 4,000 wallets of its customers were emptied, resulting in the closure of the site.  The same month, a similar incident took place in neighboring Poland, with bitcoin exchange Bidextreme.pl hacked and customers’ wallets containing bitcoins and litecoins emptied. Local company Magnus, which owns Bidextreme.pl, said the site was put up for sale to cover its users' losses, with the starting price set at 170 BTC.  Robocoin claims that the machine’s three-step verification process allows users to buy bitcoin “in under 15 seconds”. Robocoin also says its ATMs “come fully equipped with bank-grade security and biometric hardware” and are fitted with a palm vein scanner which “can limit a user's daily transaction amount by taking a unique, anonymous (no fingerprints) infrared picture of a customer's blood vessels,” according to its website.

42425347,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwBHh,1390573803,"Roll up for Branded coins, Roll on the Robot Overlords - or Just Roll Your Own","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 24th January 2014 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.    Brand-new brand news    How many currencies are there? That’s an unanswerable question. If you define currency as nation-state backed traditional notes-and-coins currency, then there are around 170, lightly fewer than the 190-odd countries in the world. If you mean tokens of value, then who knows - you can count anything from Costa Coffee loyalty card stamps to gambling chips.      As for cryptocurrencies: last time anyone counted, there were 140 or so. By the time you read this, they’ll probably be on a par with the fiat brigade. And, if marketing outfit Humint’s plans come to fruition, there could be thousands.      Humint’s bright idea is for companies to create their own branded cryptocurrencies for loyalty-card like schemes. Technically, that’s not difficult or expensive: all the tools to create new cryptocurrencies are freely available and a small development team could get the whole lot put together, including mining software, mobile apps, wallets and chain management guff, in a few intensive days.      Or, if they’re smarter (and this has doubtless occurred to Humint, who presumably have some form of payback in mind), they spend a bit longer and build what’s called a white-label solution - a ready-to-go kit of parts to which a company just needs to add graphics, and names. Oh, and marketing.    Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should. What’s the point in multiplying cryptocurrencies? At the simplest level, it’s quite a quick and cheap way to create a loyalty scheme.  As soon as you go beyond a Costa-level system of rubber stamps (which is only suitable for low-cost items, as it’s so easy to defraud) you normally need something capable of running customer accounts. Which is why loyalty systems are either really small and limited, or run by huge companies in complicated ways.  The real fun comes when you consider that these things will be tradeable. Normally, it’s both complicated - or impossible - to trade your loyalty points for anything other than the stuff that the scheme owner allows.    But the glory of bitcoin-based currencies is that there is no central authority. If you want to swap your Pets-R-Us LizardCoins for a bunch of PerkyPence from the In-And-Out Cosmetic Surgery Shoppe, nobody will stop you (although they might giggle a bit).      All it needs is somebody else running an exchange, and you know how they blossom like mushrooms after rain. Good lord, one may even have to manage a portfolio.      There is one problem that may scupper the whole idea. Looked at from an accountancy point of view, loyalty schemes are actually quite complicated liabilities that have to squat on a company’s books. What if everyone decided to redeem all their points at the same time?      They won’t, of course, so what’s a reasonable way to measure the liability? This gets much more complicated if people are independently mining the tokens, and more complicated again if they start to have a separate life as a currency with an exchange rate above their redemption value with the company who owns the brand.      John Law doesn’t pretend to know how the existing dynamics of loyalty schemes will interact with the wild world of cryprocurrencies, except to note that it actually sounds a great deal more fun than just collecting Nectar Points when he buys his bog rolls at Tesco. And certainly more fun than his painfully acquired collection of Virgin Atlantic points, that quietly evaporated one year when he wasn’t flying much.      Not that he’s bitter. But he could really do with a spot of botox.    A brave new world - with elephants    And talking of white-label systems, the biggest one ever was announced this week. Called Ethereum, it is … well, one problem is that it’s hard to describe.      It’s like a combined operating system/network/toolset for building not just cryptocurrencies but all manner of services and products. You can read all the details available so far, but in brief: it claims to fix most of the problems with mining by being very ASIC-unfriendly, it has clever ways to fix the problems in distributing giant block chains, and it has its own programming language.      That’s key. Using it, people can write apps - called contracts - that take care of the mechanics of sending and receiving coins, but can also add a lot of intelligence. That means you can link payments and identities to external assets, or financial instruments, or anything else you’d like to actually do with whatever currency you want to do it with.      It’s a very ambitious project, and will need a lot more discussion and conceptual tyre-kicking. The really interesting question is not whether it works, but what happens if it does?      The creators say that it’ll be a challenge to regulators, primarily because it allows decentralised organisations to exist - a group of people in a company-like collective, but with nothing you can actually point to as the place it exists. Add anonymity, and you’re a slippery beast indeed. Half-human, half-code, such chimeric corporations will be a most interesting experiment to try and contain.      John Law doesn’t think that’s the biggest elephant in the room. One of the things that could - hell, will - happen on Ethereum fairly shortly after it becomes reality is automated trading, in pretty much anything by pretty much anyone.      Experience of such systems shows that algorithms can and do behave very badly in the wrong circumstances, leading to out-of-control spirals or crashes in markets, and the big exchanges now have a number of big red buttons to push when some robot runs amok. And the regulators have built their own seriously severe monitoring systems.      The more complex and automatic a system is, and the greater the range of data types it has to deal with, the higher the chances of the unexpected event. These are examples of emergent properties; which are quite a hot scientific area to study. Mostly we know that we don’t know much about them.      But the point of Ethereum - and cybercurrencies in general - is that they’re big red button resistant. They encourage unregulated experimentation, and they thrive on removing barriers to things happening.      Welcome to the future: watch out for the elephants.    No cybercoins for stoners    Phew. After such high-falutin’ thinkin’, what could be better than to sit back, loosen the tie, and fire up a big fat analogy. Sparking John Law’s interest this week is a fragrant, powerful, single-strain jazz cigarette of a concept: bitcoin is like cannabis.      Well, yes. Both annoy the authorities, who would like to ban their consumption on mildly illogical grounds to do with harm and criminality. They’re forbidden because they’re bad: the proof that they’re bad? Well, they’ve been forbidden.      However, people seem ever less willing to follow these strictures. Bitcoin is growing apace, and while the regulators clearly don’t like it they’re gradually adapting to something they can’t just ban. Dope smoking has been popular for a long time, but after a few decades of banning it to no good effect, the lawmakers are inching their way towards the exit on this one too.      In both cases, a lack of clarity (no, not the sort that comes after blazing the hydro) is causing its own problems.      In Colorado, where the state has legalised pot, cannabis shops are finding that because it’s still illegal under federal law, credit card companies are liable to refuse their transactions. Sometimes. The alternative is cash, and it’s not much fun having to haul large amounts of the stuff around on a daily basis.      Bitcoin might seem a philosophical match and a practical answer - but with banks still liable to shut down accounts used for bitcoin trading that’s one set of ambiguities too many. So the smoke shops are either not taking it or, if they are, not advertising the fact.    There is a delicious irony here, that a currency much lambasted for enabling transactions in prohibited substances fails to be much good once they come off the naughty list. It’s an object lesson in how, if you’re operating at the edge of legality, your other affairs must be scrupulously spotless.  John Law, of course, is beyond reproach in all his affairs, private and public, and recommends that nobody smoke anything stronger than a kipper.  Although, if a custom altcoin was introduced for enthusiastic smokers, he is sure it would have an impressive hash rate.    John Law is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler. Having reformed the French economy, invented paper currency, state banks, the Mississippi Bubble and other ideas essential to modern economics, he took three hundred years off in a small cottage outside Bude.

42425339,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwB1h,1390570258,Coinpunk Crowdfunding Bitcoin Wallet That Apple Can't Ban,"Open-source bitcoin project Coinpunk has launched an Indiegogo campaign in an effort to raise funding for a new wallet solution that could be used on iOS devices without a jailbreak.  Apple has a history of restricting bitcoin-related apps in the app store (which contains over 1 million apps). Thus, Coinpunk is not designing an app, but a web application.  The web application allows users to create self-hosted bitcoin wallets and access them through the browser, rendering Apple’s walled garden approach pointless. The idea of self-hosted wallets is interesting, as many users are still suspicious of online wallets, so they tend to believe their bitcoins are safer in their own hands.  Coinpunk is based on HTML5, and it is accessible from Safari, Apple’s stock iOS browser. Better yet, since it is a web-based HTML5 application, it can be used on almost any platform out there – Windows, Android, Mac OS X, etc.  100% open source  The developers say they are planning to make standalone/browser store versions, integrate support for cold wallets, introduce more merchant tools and add more options for buying bitcoin. Support for altcoins is coming too, but the team admits their primary focus is on bitcoin. Their goal is outlined on Indiegogo:  “We want to prove that you can make 100% open source HTML5/JS Bitcoin wallets that work just as well as proprietary native ones, if not better.”  However, to make it all happen the Coinpunk team needs a fair bit of cash. The funding goal is $55,000, which sounds rather ambitious. The money will be used to pay server and development bills, improve the website, conduct security audits and – of course – pay for living expenses. Even developers have to eat and sleep every once in a while.  There are still 60 days to go, and the team is accepting contributions in bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin. At the time of writing, Coinpunk's campaign had already raised $741.00.  Although many crypto fans are still expecting Apple to ease its restrictions, this does not seem very likely at this point. Apple has very strict policies, and unlike Google it vets every app its offers through its app store.  Last year, the Coinbase iOS app, which enabled users to buy, sell and send bitcoin, was removed from the App Store less than a month after its launch. However, other bitcoin apps, including ZeroBlock and Blockchain.info, are still available on iOS.

42425346,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwBDh,1390557647,Bitcoin ATM Appearance Draws Crowds in Zurich,"It's the financial capital of Switzerland, filled with huge banks and powerful companies. It is also considered the world’s largest gold trading centre, and is home to over 1,300 multi-millionaires. And now, after a guest appearance by a bicoin ATM, Zurich has been introduced to cryptocurrencies.  The ATM in question is a Lamassu unit that was widely considered to be Europe’s first bitcoin ATM when it was installed at a market hall in the Slovakian Capital, Bratislava. After reading about the unit, two Zurich-based bitcoin enthusiasts, Dorian Credé and Christian Mäder, took the 10-hour trip to see the machine in action.  They were both impressed. So much so, that Credé called Lamassu that very evening to place an order for his own unit.  But unwilling to wait for the ATM to be delivered in mid-march, Credé set out to convince Marian Jančuška, who owns the Bratislava unit, to let them take it to Zurich for a guest appearance. To his surprise Jančuška immediately agreed, and one week later Credé and Mäder went back to pick up the unit and install it in a busy market hall in the centre of the city.  Beyond expectation  The trial ended on Wednesday, and Credé said it was a “huge success, beyond [...] expectations”. Over the four days that the machine was operational, 90 transactions were made and a total of 14.8 bitcoins were purchased.  This is despite the machine only being able to handle euros, not Swiss Francs – and only being able to display Slovakian as a language. Also, being a Lamassu unit, it only converts fiat currency to bitcoin, not the other way around.  Credé and Mäder were on hand with the ATM at all times to help people buy bitcoin, and answer any questions about the cryptocurrency. It was hard work, but worth it, said Credé:  “People came from all parts of Switzerland just to see the ATM. It was pretty cool. We had one person from MasterCard and one from a private bank who came all the way from Geneva just to buy some bitcoin, Then they asked a few questions before they drove all the way back.”  Credé said that he invested about 2,000 CHF (approximately $2,219) of his own money to bring the machine over. The 3% service charge went to the ATM’s owner Jančuška, so in the end he has no financial gain to show for it. But this was never the plan.  “It was more a spontaneous reaction. I love the idea of being the first to show it in Switzerland. I can say mission accomplished,” he said.  Bitcoin fascination  Credé’s fascination with bitcoin goes back several years, stemming from his other project: Wikirating which provides free and collaborative credit ratings of companies and countries.  After having the idea to pay contributors in bitcoin, he became more and more interested in the cryptocurrency. Credé eventually started the World Bitcoin Association with Mäder – who is one of Switzerland’s most prominent bitcoin bloggers. The aim of the Association is to unite non-profit bitcoin organisations around the world.  One person involved the project to bring the ATM to Switzerland had a step learning curve. Daniel Bollhalder, who manages the market hall where the ATM was housed, admits he did not know much about bitcoin and that he is quite “old-school” when it comes to these things.  However, after seeing the machine in action he was more than happy to offer a permanent space for Credé’s own ATM when it is delivered.  “We are crazy people, so we say yes to crazy projects. It is that simple,” he said.

42425332,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwAph,1390536497,Solarcoin Awards Coins for Solar Power Generation,"Most altcoins seem to tweak technical or monetary principles. Here's one with a single purpose: to promote renewable energy. It's called solarcoin, and people are mining it now.  The brainchild of Nick Gogerty, principal at Thoughtful Capital Group and self-proclaimed ""deep finance geek"", solarcoin is designed to reward people for producing energy via photovoltaic solar panels.  Gogerty, who advises hedge and mutual funds on equity investing, is all about the mechanics of value creation. He has a book coming out on how to create value in the adaptive economy.  The initiative is based on a paper that Gogerty co-authored in 2011. ""The concept was how a central bank could use energy as a currency and how that could tie into an economy. Nothing came of that, due to the fact that you needed a central bank,"" he says.  ""The advent of bitcoin and alt currencies in a secure and structured piece of technology became very interesting and meant that this approach could be implemented.""  The initiative is designed to encourage the generation of solar energy over a 40-year period. Solarcoin maps directly to solar power. Each one of them would be worth 1Mw of electricity.  A proof of physical work  Coins would be awarded based on a proof of work, but instead of computational, the proof would be mostly physical - an organization or company would be given a solarcoin for every 1Mw/hour of energy that they produced using their photovoltaic solar arrays.  There is a 98.1bn coin cap, and 97.5bn of them have been created from scratch. They are held by an organization called the Open Currency Association, which will grant them to generators over time. 105m coins will be mined, to kickstart the network. The remaining 500m will be in a 'genesis pool account', intended for environment groups, early volunteers and advisors.  How will people get these coins? You can mine them (yes, that chews up energy, but the team has chosen scrypt for the proof of work, so at least it won't encourage a race for computing power). You can buy them on the open market - Gogerty anticipates a price in the $20-$30 window over the next 3-5 years if all goes to plan - or you can get them as a reward for your solar power generation.  The latter option is the coin's real purpose, Gogerty says; the mining part is simply there because the coin needs a network.  ""The energy that is generated will have to be submitted as a claim for solarcoin"" he explains. ""There are regimes in different countries, regulatory and others, where they track solar energy production to give back incentives.""  People in the US will be able to provide their Solar Renewable Energy Certificate (SREC) ID for the appropriate quantity of coins. These certificates are tax incentives from US states that offer them, and are themselves traded on the open market.  The solarcoin site says that every megawatt-hour of electricity generated through a solar PV panel avoids more than 1,500 lbs of carbon dioxide (CO2), along with over five lbs of sulfur dioxide (SO2), and almost two lbs of nitrogen oxide (NOx). We assume they're talking about coal plant pollution here.  Gogerty has good timing, for two reasons. Firstly, fossil plant pollution is a hot button in the US at the moment. On Jan 8th, the Environment Protection Agency announced rules that would limit emissions from coal plants, and it has sent Republican leaders into a frenzy.  Secondly, the solar industry is due for a renaissance, according to analysts. In a recent research note, Deutsche Bank Markets Research predicted a ""second gold rush"" for PV installations, driven by a variety of factors.  The Bank predicted that around 46GW of solar energy would be installed worldwide this year, and approximately 56GW next year, revising its previous forecast upwards. One of the big drivers would be leasing options in the residential solar market, it said.  Rooftop installers now offer residential customers the chance to lease the solar equipment, avoiding the up front capital expenditure while taking advantage of the power benefits. Customers are likely to race to install solar in the next couple of years, because the US government's Solar Investment Tax Credit runs out in 2016.  The OCA would also work with utility-scale providers, who can also benefit from SRECs, says Gogerty. These massive providers generally build large solar arrays out in the desert. Solarcoin may be a tougher sell for those companies, who rely on venture funding and other private capital for their project financing (and that has been relatively thin on the ground lately).  There are drawbacks. One of them is that, whereas most altcoins are designed to be independent of geography or government, the OCA's paperwork may have to be retooled for different countries. They all have different regulatory and incentive frameworks which would affect how the coin works, and the OCA - which doesn't even have a charter yet - will need to work with each of them independently to get the coin up and running.  That's a lot of work for a volunteer-driven organization. Nevertheless, Gogerty names Germany (a huge market for solar) and the UK as two pivotal future markets for solarcoin.  ""The more that we can scale and work with different governments and regulatory regimes to get this coin out, the better,"" he says.  Would the existence of a solarcoin persuade you to invest in that rooftop array? Tell us in the comments.

42425343,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwB5h,1390531773,CoinSeed Announces $5 Million Investment in BitFury Mining Gear,"Las Vegas-based bitcoin investment fund CoinSeed announced a substantial investment of $5m in mining hardware on 23rd January.  CoinSeed  revealed that it has acquired $5m worth of BitFury’s 55 nanometre bitcoin hardware, but that this is just its first step in its larger vision to become a large-scale bitcoin clearing house, one that will be able to someday process the real-time transactions it says bitcoin will need to truly compete in payments.  The announcement might not sit well with some members of the bitcoin community, especially among miners and those who frown upon centralisation.  CoinSeed's Merlin Kauffman, however, suggested such sentiments risk holding the wider bitcoin community back at a time when companies like his own are seeking to improve and scale the currency's infrastructure.    ""Personally, I'm sure there will be people out there who are grassroots bitcoin purists, who are going to say you're taking something that's grassroots and decentralised and making it a commercial venture,"" Kauffman said.        ""But, on the other hand, it's these same people who want bitcoin to be taken seriously, and bitcoin is in serious need of some larger players coming in and giving it legitimacy.""    Securing funding  CoinSeed says it raised $7.5m from private investors in less than a month, and that it is aggressively investing in mining hardware to secure a leading position in commercial mining. In addition to Kauffman, CoinSeed's team includes Zach Dailey, founder of LabRatMining, as well as other sales and technical employees. The company plans to raise an additional $15m over the next eight months to bring its total funding to $22.5m.  Kauffman noted that his experience securing investment was helped greatly by his tenure in the domain name sector 10 years ago. While he declined to mention names, he noted he relied on these past relationships as a means to secure necessary funding.    ""It was fairly easy for me to raise the money, because I have a proven track record of success with interesting businesses models and interesting business,"" Kauffman said.            Scaling its operations  MegaBigPower  , the US distributor of BitFury mining gear, said the CoinSeed deal is the biggest single-order purchase of bitcoin mining hardware to date.  David Carlson, president of MegaBigPower stated in a press release that the company has entered into a long-term agreement with CoinSeed to provide “a stable supply” of hardware to support their infrastructure requirements.  CoinSeed's big picture  Despite issues with volatility, Kauffman said he is confident in bitcoin’s long-term viability both as a currency and payment method. For example, the company says it will look to generate returns in bitcoin, which it hopes will increase in value to support its goal of serving large merchants.  ""I think that everyone is pretty well aware of the issue of confirmation times and that being problematic for real-time transactions, especially given that it's a volatile market right now. In the future, a lot of these large merchants are going to be in need of dedicated confirmation power to rapidly transact their sales.""  However, while Kauffman considers the future to be bright for CoinSeed, he is less optimistic about mining and its role in the evolution of bitcoin.  ""Mining is a cool thing, it's a fun thing, but it's not forever, difficulty is on the rise. Mining will always happen, it's just not going to be as profitable.""  Kauffman added that the company is already ""in talks"" with high-volume merchants, and that it is pursuing ""other cryptocurrency investment opportunities"".
