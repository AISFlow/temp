42426533,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtPvh,1443473822,Ethereum: Bitcoin Price Decline Created $9 Million Funding Shortfall,"Ethereum has released new details about the state of its finances, ending speculation about the project's financial health that has persisted among the technology's enthusiasts.  One of the most successful token crowdsales in history by some metrics, the ambitious blockchain-based decentralized application platform raised 31,529 BTC, or roughly $18.4m at then market prices, through the sale of Ether, its native blockchain tokens last July.  Of issue since has been the lack of clarity regarding how much real-world funding Ethereum and its related entities have had in reserve due to the subsequent decline in the price of bitcoin relative to the US dollar.  However, Ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin today revealed new details about the subject today in a blog post dedicated to providing an update on the state of the open-source project, launched to the public on 30th July with its Frontier release.  Buterin wrote that the Ethereum Foundation, the Switzerland-based nonprofit that handles Ether's financials and manages development funding, is facing budget constraints due to the declining value of bitcoin against the US dollar.  Buterin said:  ""It is indeed true that the foundation’s finances are limited, and a large part of this was the result of our failure to sell nearly as much of our BTC holdings as we were planning to before the price dropped to $220; as a result, we suffered roughly $9m in lost potential capital.""  The former editor and founder of Bitcoin Magazine painted the project as in a time of ""complicated transition"" given that its needs have expanded along with its vision to launch a blockchain with built-in Turing-complete programming language.  When asked about the foundation's hiring plans, Buterin told CoinDesk the group had ""already cut some, and [was] cutting some [more personnel] soon."" However, he expressed optimism that as the Ethereum Foundation reduced its paid staff, developers and other employees would be hired by projects building on top of the platform.  ""Note that a substantial number of Ethereum foundation subsidiary staff is going to be moving over to the rapidly growing for-profit Ethereum ecosystem over the next half year in order to bring more funds, interest and development effort into Ethereum-land.""  Overall, Buterin sought to suggest this was a natural transition for the project, one that would find it emerging from the incubation period supported by the initial funding, to a more open-source and varied funding model more comparable to the bitcoin network.  Buterin stressed that the major news from the day's announcement was the financial support of Chinese multinational automotive giant Wanxiang, which is in the process of launching a non-profit called Blockchain Labs.  Wanxiang representatives confirmed Blockchain Labs recently purchased $500,000 worth of ETH as part of its wider effort to support the technology.  Limited initial funding  The post notably listed figures representative of what Buterin claimed were the project's holdings, equalling $2.52m held in 200,000 CHF, 1,800 BTC and 2.7 ETH. At press time, 1 ETH was trading at $0.70 on bitcoin exchange Kraken.  These figures do not include a 490,000 CHF ($502,976) legal defense fund Ethereum said it is keeping on hold for possible legal defense.  Buterin went on to suggest that the Ethereum Foundation and its subsidiaries ""do not have the manpower"" to complete the current vision of the project, but cautioned that he does not believe that this puts the open-source project in jeopardy.  Monthly expenditures from the Foundation, Buterin said, are now due to fall from 410,000 CHF ($420,858) per month to 340,000 CHF ($349,201) on 1st October. The ultimate goal will be to reduce the Foundation's burn rate to between 200,000 CHF ($205,370) and 250,000 CHF ($256,818) per month.  ""Assuming that we get there in three months and that ether and bitcoin prices stay the same, we have enough to last until roughly June 2016 at the 340,000 [CHF] rate, and perhaps up to Sep-Dec 2016 given planned transitions,"" the post continued. ""By that point, the intent is for the foundation to secure alternative revenue sources.""  According to Buterin, contributors to the Ethereum project are able to receive funds in ETH, BTC or CHF, though he was less clear about how such payments interacted with cryptocurrency markets, stating that ETH payments had not yet ""touched primary ether markets"".  Buterin indicated that the Ethereum Foundation no longer had the funds to meet its hiring schedule in relation to project demands.  ""A hiring schedule that was meant to last over three years ended up lasting a little under two (although bolstered by a 'second wind' from our ETH holdings),"" he wrote.  Possible revenue streams  The post speculates on potential ways for the Ethereum Foundation to continue to take in funding from the community, with possible revenue streams including developer workshops and conferences, efforts Buterin suggested were already underway.  The project also committed to becoming more transparent about its finances as it seeks to work past short-term budgeting issues, suggesting it is working with Ethereum-based accounting software provider Consensys to record all its expenses in the blockchain.  Confusion about the handling of project funds can be seen in interest group forums, where speculation has persisted that Ethereum's sale of bitcoin was having an affect on the bitcoin price as far back as last August. Further, details regarding how bitcoins raised as part of the effort would be used were scarce in its initial crowdsale communications.  Of note regarding the project's future is that the price of ETH has declined in September, from 0.0059 BTC on 1st September to 0.0026 BTC at current market prices.

42426543,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtQDh,1443471414,Imperial College London Opens Cryptocurrency Research Center,"UPDATE (28th September 22:25 BST): This piece has been updated with comment from Imperial College Professor William Knottenbelt.      Imperial College London has established a research center dedicated to blockchain initiatives.  Announced  in the university's summer newsletter, the Centre for Cryptocurrency Research and Engineering grew out of previous Imperial College efforts aimed at exploring bitcoin and the blockchain.  The university, founded in 1907, is considered one of the world's top technical institutes.  The notice explained:  ""With an overwhelming response from staff and students, the Centre will now coordinate research grants directed at designing and engineering improvements to the protocols that underpin blockchain technology. It will also coordinate application-based funding directed at prototyping chain-based solutions across multiple domains.""  The launch of the research center at Imperial College represents a growing interest amongst academic institutions in the technology.  Professor William Knottenbelt, of the university's Department of Comptuing, will act as the Centre's first director. When reached, he told CoinDesk in an email that the initiative represents ""a due recognition of the exciting cryptocurrency-related work being carried out by staff and students across many departments"" at Imperial College.  ""We intend to focus on two areas: first, conducting research directed at designing and engineering improvements to the protocols underpinning blockchain technology,"" he continued. ""Second, exploring novel blockchain-based applications across mulitple domains. We look forward to considerably broadening our industrial and academic collaborations through the activities of this new centre.""

42426552,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtQPh,1443455343,Kickstarter Launched for Piggy Bank that Lets Kids Save in Bitcoin,"A team of creative technologists based in Denmark have launched a Kickstarter campaign for a digital piggy bank and app that enable children to save in bitcoin.  The Ernit app is connected to an interactive physical piggy bank that uses light to show children how close they are to reaching their saving goals.  According to Thomas Bjerring, founder and partner at Ernit, the idea first emerged approximately three years ago, when members of the team – most of whom are parents – began to discuss the idea of giving their children digital pocket money.  Bitcoin, Bjerring said, seemed like an obvious option, adding:  ""We believe bitcoin and the concept of decentralised currencies is an important part of the future, when it comes to money and means of exchange. Bitcoin was an obvious choice when we decided what should be available for our users.""  Funding and monetisation  The team – which says it received a $15,000 grant from a Danish innovation fund and has attracted approximately $75,000 from investors to date – is currently running a Kickstarter campaign to raise an additional $80,000.  Bjerring told CoinDesk that, if obtained, the funds would be used for ongoing development; including the addition of new features, further beta testing and producing Ernit units in additional colours.  With regards to monetisation, Bjerring said the app and the service will be free for consumers. The piggy bank, however, will be sold for a fee.  How it works  “Contributions from parents are done through the app, where each family member is connected to the kid that saves money. Ways of transferring from patrons outside the family account depends on the account setup,” explained Bjerring.  To start using the system, the adult is first required to set up an Ernit app account. Users are then able to link up an Ernit wallet, a bitcoin wallet or a bank account.  The parent is then able to add their children – and any other family members willing to contribute funds – to the family’s account.  Once funds are sent to the child’s Ernit account, he or she will receive an alert on the piggy bank, which will prompt the child to claim the funds by pressing its snout.  Now in possession of the funds, the child is able to distribute and track the money according to their individual saving goals.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/09/28/kickstarter-launched-for-piggy-bank-that-lets-kids-save-in-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dfd83bb2405ed3d52445f1bef91c628ba516cc66-1500x623.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426529,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtPth,1443432987,"With Bitcoin's Price Down, VCs Turning to Blockchain Technology","The rising interest in use cases for bitcoin's underlying distributed ledger, the blockchain, is influencing the investment strategies of venture capitalists, new interviews indicate.  Speaking to CoinDesk, some of the ecosystem's most frequent and most vocal investors are suggesting they are now working more closely with banks and putting an increased emphasis on projects that use the bitcoin blockchain or alternative distributed ledgers as a payments rail or distributed database.  For example, Bart Stephens, managing partner at Blockchain Capital, which recently rebranded its firm from Crypto Currency Partners, suggested the industry has ""evolved"" as awareness of the blockchain's use cases become more widely analyzed and understood.  Stephens told CoinDesk:  ""There's been a realization that [the blockchain is] an incredible tech layer, but the conversation doesn't end there, you're seeing the conversation broaden out of financial services, how can it be leveraged for identity management, smart contracts and international trade.""  Others like Aleph Venture Capital partner Eden Shochat, whose investments include blockchain technology firm Colu, expressed more interest in distributed ledger applications, a part of the industry where new startups such as Blockstack, Eris and Multichain are now seeking to separate from a widening pack that lacks clear leaders.  ""With bitcoin, we are less intrigued by quick in and outs of the bitcoin system, such as payment processing or remittance using bitcoin as a currency as an intermediate step,"" Shochat said. ""That's generally optimizing transaction costs, but there are bigger opportunities, such as replacing inter-company supply chains via bitcoin payments.""  Cross Pacific Capital  's (CPC) Marc van der Chijs was more direct in his assessment of his firm's interest in the industry. ""We look more at blockchain startups, and not pure bitcoin payment companies like wallets and exchanges,"" he said.  Van der Chijs suggested CPC is now focused on applications for the technology in international money transfer and for distributed databases. Still, not every investor agrees that these are the immediate opportunities.  For example, Jeremy Liew, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, told CoinDesk he believes its use as a store of value is still the most compelling in the short term.  Wall Street interest  Elsewhere, Stephens spoke to the general increase in interest of major banks in the technology, reporting he has briefed the board of directors at roughly 15 major banks.  ""Two years ago banks were focused on bitcoin and were scared as to what that meant, they saw it as dangerous and were scared of how banks would work with bitcoin businesses,"" he said. ""Fast forward a couple of years, we've seen banks increasingly focus on blockchain.""  Stephens said he has been spending more time introducing Blockchain Capital's portfolio companies to major banks. Blockchain Capital has so far made 37 investments in the industry, participating in funding rounds for major players including Blockstream, Chain, Circle and Xapo. He continued:  ""[Banks] have blockchain task forces, and they say we want to learn more about blockchain tech. Based on their answers, we play a match-making service.""  Given the recent interest from major banks in bitcoin and the blockchain, many investors also believe financial entities will soon start looking to acquire industry firms.  ""I believe banks can’t innovate and, once they realize this, they will start buying bitcoin and blockchain startups,"" van der Chijs said, adding that some will be bought for their intellectual property, while others for experienced teams.  ""That will be the first wave of bitcoin exits,"" he said, though he noted this was not likely to occur within the next four to five years.  Shochat was less convinced banks won't be able to innovate, suggesting he believes they can leverage their current knowledge to help startups solve problems in their value chain.  ""There are so many opportunities, anywhere from clearing and vaults to bank-sponsored wallets and replacing SWIFT,"" he continued. ""This isn’t the same role as venture investors, but banks can significantly direct ventures toward the right use cases.""  Stephens further suggested he believes financial institutions are ""moving slowly"" and at this point, are just ""information gathering"" when it comes to the technology.  Liew, an investor in firms including Blockchain, BTCC (formerly BTC China) and Ripple Labs, was more dismissive of the role banks would play in any larger technology transition, suggesting these groups are not likely to replace the role of VCs in the ecosystem.  Deal volumes  Despite a decline in bitcoin and blockchain VC investments in Q3, most investors surveyed reported this was unlikely a result of any waning interest in the industry.  Shochat, for instance, said Aleph typically only invests in 3% of the companies it sees across all sectors, and it is actively looking for deals with bitcoin startups. Van der Chijs echoed this observation, noting that CPC is transitioning from an early-stage to growth firm, and is now focused on late-stage investments.  Further, he suggested industry observers put the activity of VC firms in context of their overall deal flow. ""Four investments may not seem like a lot of investments, but given that we only do about five investments per year out of over 300 companies that we look at, it’s actually quite substantial for us,"" he explained.  Of those surveyed, most reported they don't believe there's any significant funding crunch facing the industry. Despite the lack of major Series B and Series C rounds, Stephens attributed this to trends in the overall VC space, where seed funding is easier to obtain.  ""In general in technology, you see a lot of seed-stage companies, but once you have that, it's challenging to get to a Series A or Series B,"" Stephens said. ""Bitcoin is somewhat out of favor. In the last 15 to 16 months, the price of bitcoin has dropped 65-75%.""  Stephens expressed his belief that savvy investors would continue to measure the ecosystem by factors such as wallet growth and GitHub participation, but suggested these are of less interest to the wider venture industry.  ""The average VC is very focused on the price of bitcoin,"" he said, a remark echoed by Liew who said the ""flatness"" of bitcoin's price has created a decline in investor interest.  Correction: A previous version of this article stated Blockchain Capital had made only 20 investments in the ecosystem.
