42398155,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbShOJ,1421970130,OKCoin CEO Star Xu: Bitcoin’s Price Depends on User Growth,"“If the industry is only interested in buying, selling and trading bitcoin, confidence will disappear.”  The remark finds OKCoin CEO Star Xu cutting to the core of what seems to be on his mind these days. The head of the world’s leading BTC/CNY exchange, Xu looks contemplative, picking absentmindedly at the grass in front of Miami’s Fillmore Theater, winding the stems through his fingers and plucking pieces from their roots as he sits for a new interview with CoinDesk.  In contrast to the Western perception that OKCoin has led the charge toward introducing more advanced, and some would argue more risky, financial trading tools to the ecosystem, Xu’s first speaking appearance in the US was one that sought to project a more friendly and inclusive message – one that ties the fate of his company to the network at large.  Taking place on day one of The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC), Xu’s talk was largely focused on finding “real use cases” for bitcoin. On stage, he argued that bitcoin's value is already determined by expectations of its future use, a point he later underscored.  Xu said:  “The bitcoin market is different from the stock market. The price of the stock is based on the company’s profits or revenue. Bitcoin is different. Why does bitcoin have price? Because people believe it will be used in the future. The industry has to find a new use case, otherwise confidence in bitcoin will be compromised.”  Throughout the interview, Xu stressed that OKCoin needs to encourage more consumers and merchants to use bitcoin, though he argued that, unlike companies in the US market, the China-based exchange will need to take an active part in creating the wider bitcoin economy.  “There’s a lot of startups in the US,” Xu said. “In China, there are only several big bitcoin companies, so we have to build a bitcoin ecosystem.”  The comments come as part of a wide-ranging talk that found Xu opening up about OKCoin’s position in the market, bitcoin’s value proposition in e-commerce and the challenges the company faces as it seeks to build its international user base.  Syncing with the West  To better frame the current challenges at OKCoin, Xu often talked more generally about how OKCoin has a unique opportunity at the “starting line” of the bitcoin industry, something that sets it apart from past Chinese tech ventures.  Xu talked about OKCoin’s need to “sync itself” with its US competitors in a bid to change how Internet commerce has developed historically.  “Over the last 20 years, the whole Internet industry has just been copied in China,” he explained. “Bitcoin is the same, some big companies in China are just waiting for what happens in the US.”  Xu explained that Chinese Internet companies have long followed the business models of established US companies, citing the Chinese version of eBay, Taobao, and its homegrown Google, Baidu, where Xu worked as a search engineer.  Using this as an example, Xu framed China’s merchants as less willing to consider bitcoin as an e-commerce tool.  “In China, most merchants think they want to wait until bitcoin becomes a more established industry, then they can accept it. They want to follow the US. I think if Amazon accepts bitcoin, Alibaba has to,” Xu said.  Doing it all  Xu indicated that OKCoin is also in a unique position, as it needs to be involved in many facets of bitcoin business in a bid to increase its prospects – not a small task considering the company already operates a RMB exchange, USD exchange, margin trading service, futures trading service, payment platform, multisig wallet, payment gateway and application platform.  In this light, finding specific target markets where bitcoin might prove advantageous, Xu indicated, would be top priority. OKCoin is particularly interested in cross-border money sending services, he suggested.  “A lot of Chinese people try to buy something from Amazon or Newegg. Payment is difficult for them, so we are proposing bitcoin as a solution,” Xu continued. “There are many families sending their children to study overseas in the US, offering a potential opportunity for bitcoin to be used within this specific market.”  Here again, Xu framed his company’s efforts as similar to his home country’s Internet giants.  “Alibaba offers B2B, B2C and a payment business,” he said. “They have to do this because when they do e-commerce, there’s no payment in China, so you have to do payment. There’s no UPS, so Alibaba has to do this.”  Still, Xu seems unsure of exactly what role OKCoin will take in this process, adding: “We don’t want to run all the businesses, but we have to build the ecosystem.”  International trust  Trust was another recurring theme in the conversation, with Xu emphasizing that this is a major focus for OKCoin, both at home and abroad. The necessity of such measures was on display at TNABC, with Xu facing sometimes pointed questions from the audience about the exchange’s role in leveraged trading.  Still, Xu sees ways for his company to bridge the East-West divide that has become palpable in the conversation surrounding bitcoin.  “I think we have to become more open to international customers and earn their trust,” Xu stated. “We can provide our cold wallet address, we can do proof of reserves and show our exchange infrastructure to our customers. I believe our technology is very good. I believe that by being transparent, we can earn users' trust.”  Overall, Xu said the company needs a better approach to earn that trust, though he noted US companies would likely face similar barriers to entry in China.  Emphasis on security  Security was yet another major theme of the conference, which took place in the shadow of the $5m hack at Europe-based bitcoin exchange Bitstamp. During this time, OKCoin notably capitalized, pulling ahead of Bitstamp to the number two position in terms of daily USD trading volumes.  Despite the incident at Bitstamp, however, Xu was not concerned that OKCoin would fall victim to similar issues.  “Security is the most important thing to us,” Xu said. “We use our own technology, we have a team of three individuals that solely focus on security.”  Xu went on to describe OKCoin’s risk control system, which he said scans the exchange every two minutes. “If we find a difference all withdrawals are stopped, and we send a message,” Xu said.  “Our financial team has to review this data everyday. If there's some difference, they cannot go home. Everybody needs to follow those rules. On the weekend, we have three financial accountants who work in shifts to cover all hours,” he remarked. “This is done on a daily basis, seven days a week, year round.”  Over time, Xu suggested this determination will win over more skeptical consumers abroad.  He concluded:  “I think international for OKCoin is on the way.”  Image via Joshua Dykgraaf for TNABC",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/22/okcoin-ceo-star-xu-bitcoins-price-depends-on-user-growth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8631d26f0b49c0b665c4cf11416fcd8aee4532cd-1275x562.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398152,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbShML,1421950210,Braintree Activates Bitcoin Payments for US Merchants,"UPDATE (22nd Jan 20:10 GMT): Braintree has responded to questions about US merchant adoption of its development kit and clarified that customers can only pay in bitcoin through a Coinbase account.      Merchants who use the payments software platform Braintree in the US can enable bitcoin payments through Coinbase starting today.  Braintree  said that it had integrated Coinbase into its software development kit, which it calls v.zero. This means that merchants who use the kit can now enable bitcoin payments quickly, Braintree said.  ""Bitcoin is growing in popularity for consumer and merchants alike ... the number of companies both small and large working to enable bitcoin acceptance is on the rise,"" Braintree said in a blog post announcing the move.  Braintree, a subsidiary of PayPal, wouldn't reveal the number of US merchants who use its development kit, saying only that it has seen ""widespread adoption"" of the software tool since it was released in July. The integration will require customers to have Coinbase accounts in order to pay merchants in bitcoin.  Braintree had 85.7 million cards on file to use its single-click or repeat purchase feature in the third quarter of last year, according to PayPal's latest quarterly financial report.  Seeking a 'seamless' experience  First announced in September, the integration process required more time than expected in order to create a ""seamless"" experience for merchants, Coinbase said in a statement.  ""We believe the extra time spent perfecting this experience will make merchants and consumers alike happy,"" a spokesperson said.  Braintree counts companies like Uber, Airbnb and OpenTable among its clients. Further, it allows merchants to accept payments from credit and debit cards, PayPal, Apple Pay and its mobile payments wallet Venmo.  Braintree chief executive Bill Ready is known for his optimism about bitcoin's future as a payments method, telling CoinDesk in November that his firm is working to take bitcoin mainstream.

42398150,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbShKN,1421947932,Bill Gates: Bitcoin Alone Won't Solve Global Payments Challenges,"Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has said digital currencies could have an impact on global remittances, but suggested that bitcoin isn't the best application of the technology.  Gates, speaking with Backchannel before the release of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s annual letter, spoke about a number of subjects, including the role of mobile technology in developing economies and artificial intelligence.  When asked about digital currencies like bitcoin and the technology’s ability to deliver cheaper global transactions, Gates said he thinks bitcoin will not be the distributed payment system used in the future, but that it holds the potential to make a huge impact nonetheless.  Gates said:  “There’s a lot that bitcoin or Ripple and variants can do to make moving money between countries easier and getting fees down pretty dramatically. But bitcoin won’t be the dominant system.”  Gates has offered a cautiously optimistic viewpoint on bitcoin in the past.  He told Bloomberg TV in October that while bitcoin is “exciting”, he sees problems with the digital currency’s existing political complications. In February, Gates suggested that his organization is interested in developing and promoting new digital transaction methods.  Barriers to adoption  Gates told Backchannel that while bitcoin and its underlying technology can make transactions easier to move – and cheaper to do so – he believes problems like the fluctuation of value and a lack of transaction reversibility within the network are significant barriers to broader adoption.  He explained:  “When you talk about a domestic economy, [you must have] the idea of attributed transactions, where if you sent it to the wrong person you can actually get the transaction reversed. [And a traditional system] doesn’t have this huge fluctuation where the value of your account is going up and down by a factor of two.”  “We need things that draw on the revolution of bitcoin, but bitcoin alone is not good enough,” he concluded.

42377959,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LYQ3,1421942431,BitFury Eyes Bitcoin Mining Advantage With Immersion Cooling Acquisition,"BitFury Group has signed an agreement to acquire Allied Control, a Hong Kong-based tech startup that provides cooling systems for supercomputing and data center applications.  The move will make Allied Control a subsidiary and in-house special department of the bitcoin mining and transaction processing company. The deal has not yet been closed and is subject to customary conditions.  Allied specializes in two-phase immersion thermal management platforms – a technology that could perhaps match the power and energy challenges posed by large-scale bitcoin mining operations.  BitFury  told CoinDesk that the acquisition will make operations faster, more efficient and better able to deploy in scale, while providing the opportunity to enter a new market and eliminating a dependency.  It also means fewer capital expenditures, the company asserted, including almost no operational expenditures on maintenance.  Allied Control VP of operations Kar-Wing Lau said that BitFury is the “perfect match” for his company’s “disruptive” capabilities.  Lau added:  “Passive two-phase immersion cooling is especially promising for blockchain transaction processors as it addresses their need for flexibility and rapid deployment while allowing to take full advantage of higher hardware power density.”  BitFury said that in acquiring an experienced team and innovative technology, it will become strongly positioned to lead in its market.  The move follows a banner year, in which BitFury dominated VC funding in the bitcoin mining sector, raising $40m in two funding rounds.  Last month  CEO Valery Vavilov told CoinDesk that while the company is focused on bitcoin at present, it is a technology company more broadly that wants to move toward supercomputing.  Following the news of the acquisition of Allied, he said it will be better positioned to enter the high-performance computing (HPC) market.  “Our big scale production will get AC immersion cooling technology up to a new level,” said Vavilov. “Together, we hope to get leading positions on solutions for the HPC market.”  The IT infrastructure market was worth about $140bn in 2014, he explained; the HPC industry, $12bn.  In China, he added, the HPC industry has a compound annual growth rate of about 30% with increasing demand for HPC solutions from governments as well as corporations using big data analysis to improve productivity.  “It’s a very attractive high margin industry, which BitFury and Allied Control plan to revolutionize together,” he said.

42377949,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LYEj,1421929626,Ex-Rugby Star: Smart Contracts Could Prevent Legal Disputes in Sport,"Self-executing 'smart contracts' could be beneficial to the professional sports world, eliminating disputes between players and either their clubs or third-party sponsors.  That's the view of Todd Byrne, a former professional rugby star with an interest in blockchain technology, as well as developers working to build a smart contract ecosystem that will they believe will remove time and cost pressures from the present justice system.  Smart contracts have to date been a theoretical concept, though rudimentary applications have begun to appear recently in the forms of 'prediction market' betting and futures contracts.  Byrne  was a player for seven years in the National Rugby League (NRL), the premier professional rugby league in Australia and New Zealand. During that time, he played 104 games with the Sydney Roosters and New Zealand Warriors, before moving to the UK to play for two years and 24 games with Super League team Hull FC.  The situation in Australia  The NRL is one of Australasia's most popular and profitable sporting codes. Though TV broadcast rights were recently sold for over a billion dollars, teams themselves are limited in what they can pay players by a strictly enforced league salary cap.  This has led to some players seeking more lucrative deals elsewhere, sometimes even switching to rival codes of football.  Some players have been permitted to seek sponsorship deals outside their teams, called 'third-party agreements' or TPAs, for extra income. These are made with NRL approval, from sponsors affiliated or not affiliated with the players' teams.  Contracts commonly involve conditions like endorsements or appearances at a specified number of corporate and in-store events.  Non-team-affiliated TPAs, however, have had a tendency to go sour, with payment disputes arising from sponsors getting into financial difficulty, or accusations that players have not fulfilled their contractual obligations.  As a result of several high-profile disputes, many player agents now refuse to deal with TPAs altogether. Since teams have no obligation to get involved, players are often left to enforce the contracts by themselves – incurring unwanted time and cost struggles.  Byrne's example  After spending a long time studying blockchain and smart contract technology, Byrne now believes he has a solution to this problem.  He envisages a contract signed by four parties: Player A, Sponsor B, NRL Administrator C and 'Block Oracle' D.  In the smart contracts world, an 'oracle' is a piece of software that scrapes the Internet for information, or is maintained by a trusted authority, to determine whether the terms of the contract have been met.  Byrne gives the example of Player A agreeing to a $50,000 per year deal with Sponsor B, who in turn asks for one in-store appearance per month from December to September.  Signed by all four parties, the contract is then uploaded to the bitcoin blockchain and is therefore verified and transparent.  The satisfying conditions created by the two parties could be a combination of: time-stamped/GPS-marked photos hashtagged and uploaded to Twitter, the sponsor's Facebook page and/or even to the blockchain itself (as 'proof of time spent').  The Block Oracle then verifies this data to an agreed-upon level of certainty, allowing the funds to be released to the player via the private keys of two of the three human participants.  The Block Oracle could be automated to release payment itself once it determined conditions were met, Byrne added.  [post-quote]  This obviates the need for the NRL administrator to act as a dispute mediator, a role they have been loath to play anyway. There would be no embarrassing scandals played out in public and media view, and neither the player nor sponsor would have the ability to dispute the outcome.  ""The contract becomes set-and-forget,"" he said.  Auto-releasing funds to a bitcoin address would also cut payment processing time, fees, and labor costs.  There is further potential for blockchain-based smart contracts in other areas of sport as well, Byrne continued. One example would be incentive-based bonus payments, where a player is paid extra for on-field performance.  Automated oracles could scrape data on participation and scoring from a number of sources including local news services, the league's own news page and sports statistics sites.  Finding the 'pain point'  Stefan Thomas works on Codius, the smart contracts platform under development at Ripple Labs.  Speaking to CoinDesk, he said the first thing to look at when asking about the potential application of the technology is ,""What is the problem with the way it works now, and is there a concrete pain point?""  Disputes between professional sportspeople and third-party sponsors would definitely sound like something smart contracts could be useful for.  The aim is to streamline small claims cases where the facts are pretty straightforward, without needing to involve courts.  Smart contracts are not aiming to replace the legal system wholesale, he said, since that system is built to deal with a large amount of subjectivity.  Thomas said:  ""But there are a lot of cases where right now you'd have to go to court, and there'd be a lot of dispute – whereas if you had rules that the parties to the contract could trivially enforce, then it could take away some percentage of court cases.""  Self-enforcing agreements could even exist alongside courts by determining who should pay legal fees for the action, taking away at least some of the stress for parties involved.  Emergence of an industry  Bitcoin developer Peter Todd tweeted in December that once the idea for smart contracts catches on, a new industry may emerge: oracles.  The business opportunity here, continued Thomas, is for experts in a particular field to become a reliable information source, turning the intelligence they gather into machine-readable data ready for smart contract platforms to use.  Existing examples are sports tickers, companies that monitor broadcasts for appearances of corporate logos, companies like Bloomberg and Reuters that provide financial information services.  Thomas explained:  ""You really need an industry insider to kick it off. A lot of smart contracts projects are struggling with that, because we're these generalists, crypto-geeks who can think of certain use-cases from our experiences, but there's a lot of fields we just don't know about.""  In the case of sports, smart contracts could offer not only added support for those actively competing, but additional business opportunities as oracles for retired participants.  Technology already in place  Reality Keys  , a Tokyo-based startup that builds interfaces between various information oracles and contract platforms, said the technology to perform functions like conditional bitcoin payments exists right now, and is ready to be implemented.  Founder Edmund Edgar said all that is required is an API that the system can pull from. His company, which launched over a year ago, is already accessing soccer scores via football-api.com, and is interested in adding more.  Parties could even pay a company like Reality Keys to arbitrate decisions where the data is not 100% clear.  Edgar said:  ""The way the Reality Keys model works, we can work with fairly sketchy data – as long as there's some way we can get the information. Then if somebody pays us for arbitration, it doesn't matter too much if we're pulling from a biased or inaccurate API originally.""  The client software could be similar to products Reality Keys has already built for tracking personal exercise goals with RunKeeper and similar apps, he said.  Benefits to many  Smart contracts have the ability to offer protection to people who currently lack the time, financial resources or knowledge to access the traditional legal system for petty issues.  Given that this group can include everyone from an average consumer to professional sportspeople and other celebrities, the world may see a proliferation of both blockchain-based contracts and expert-administered oracle businesses in the near future.
