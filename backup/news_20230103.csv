COIN's price-to-book value is ~95% below its initial level and considerably below most traditional exchanges at ~1.4X. Coinbase's competitive weaknesses may become strengths as crypto investors flock toward higher-fee exchanges that promise greater asset security. Coinbase is one of the few cryptocurrency companies audited by a ""Big Four"" accounting firm and is subject to the added regulatory risks of public firms. As trust in fiat currencies and most institutions declines, ""alternative structures"" like Coinbase offer an indirect hedge against economic, social, and political risks. Last year ended with fireworks in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and its peers performed poorly throughout the year as investor confidence waned. As the market slowed, cracks began to surface among cryptocurrency exchanges, leading to the implosion of FTX (FTT-USD) amid allegations of significant misuse of customer funds . This event led to a massive decline in the value of most significant cryptocurrencies as contagion concerns grew and investor confidence collapsed. Stocks in the cryptocurrency sector have also imploded. Coinbase ( COIN ) lost 86% of its value in 2022 and has recently seen short interest skyrocket to 24%. COIN is essentially a proxy investment for Bitcoin and has a very high correlation with a ""beta"" close to 1 (meaning COIN usually rises or falls 1% with each 1% change in Bitcoin). See below: Data by YCharts Many speculators are betting against the company, potentially assuming that some contagion will occur across the cryptocurrency market. Coinbase is a publicly traded company, so it is less likely that the firm will carry the same risks as private peers like FTX. That said, it is a financial institution that operates outside the immense and tight regulations of traditional banks and exchanges, opening the door to abnormally high ""bank-like"" risks (poor liquidity, etc.). At this point, COIN is a high-risk stock. However, it is far less expensive than it was a year ago. The stock is also subject to high short-selling, making a significant ""dead cat bounce"" or ""short squeeze gain more likely - particularly if it outperforms weak expectations. I believe the company deserves a closer analysis of its risk exposure and upside potential, as a potential ""high-risk, high reward bet"" for 2023. Coinbase Risk Analysis One core investment issue with Coinbase is the number of potential risk factors the company is exposed to. Even if no particular risk is too likely or too large, there are so many that it seems likely at least one will have an enormous negative impact on the firm at some point in the future. In my opinion, these include (in order of severity): a widespread loss of confidence in cryptocurrency, liquidity and solvency risks, business model risks, competitive pressure, and regulatory risks. The ""side risk"" is, of course, the potential for fraud or ""FTX-like"" issues, which is difficult to assess; however, because Coinbase is an older and publicly traded company, I believe this risk factor is generally low. COIN's value is highly correlated to the price fluctuations in Bitcoin and other prominent cryptocurrencies, making it the stock's primary risk factor. This risk is also almost entirely outside of the company's control. For example, the issues in FTX led to a loss in broader confidence in cryptocurrencies, creating losses for Coinbase. Amid the debacle, the giant exchange Binance (BNB-USD) lost its auditor Mazars , no longer guaranteeing the firm's proof of reserves. The auditor also pulled from other large exchanges, raising potential contagion risks. While cryptocurrency was ""supposed"" to operate under a ""decentralized banking"" platform, it has become highly centralized among a small number of exchanges. If more of these changes prove to have poor liquidity or proof-of-reserve discrepancies, then a complete loss of confidence is possible. In my view, this risk factor is quite significant for Coinbase since it could lead to the end of the cryptocurrency industry - or at least its currency form. That said, since Coinbase is the rare public crypto exchange, it is the only one audited by a ""Big Four"" accounting firm (Deloitte). While Coinbase is not as large as Binance and is considerably more expensive than its peers, it commands the highest ""trust score"" - mainly due to its added regulations associated with being a public company. Thus, as long as fundamental confidence in cryptocurrency remains, Coinbase could become an immense net benefactor as crypto investors shift toward more trustworthy firms. That said, while Coinbase is more trustworthy than (in my view) all other exchanges, it is not as secure as traditional financial institutions. For one, it does not carry the same regulatory burdens as conventional financial institutions. Secondly, its assets and liabilities are very volatile due to volatility in the value of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase has suffered a cash and tangible book value decline and a sharp rise in leverage this year. See below: Data by YCharts Comparing the solvency and liquidity profile of Coinbase to traditional financial exchanges, Coinbase appears far riskier with high leverage and low cash liquidity compared to assets (~$110B). Those risks are compounded by the volatility in the value of cryptocurrencies as they cause immense fluctuations in Coinbase's balance sheet. While not as widespread as in other exchanges, Coinbase has a margin trading (and asset lending) program. A significant decline in major cryptocurrencies could dramatically harm Coinbase's remaining liquidity if counterparty risks grow (or B itcoin becomes less liquid amid volatility). If 2023 is like 2022 for the cryptocurrency market, then I believe Coinbase is at high risk of bankruptcy due to its tight solvency. However, this risk appears to be generally priced into COIN's value (as seen in its massive decline last year). Aside from the ""macro"" risks facing Coinbase, numerous company-specific risk factors are needed. Coinbase is a comparatively more expensive trading platform with fewer options and tradable cryptocurrencies than most of its peers. For this reason, Coinbase has not grown considerably in recent years, while peers like Binance, (formerly) FTX, Kraken, and others have grown considerably. Coinbase has lost significant market share due to its higher fee structures, opening the possibility of business failure if the trend continues. That said, if higher fees equal greater trust and investors shift toward more elevated trust platforms, Coinbase may indirectly benefit from its higher fee structures. Still, Coinbase has struggled to turn a consistent profit despite its higher fees. The company has not been publicly traded for a long time and was profitable in 2021. Of course, 2021 was an exceptional year for the cryptocurrency market, so it is unclear if Coinbase operates under a workable long-term business model. Still, this risk is largely priced into the stock following its significant drawdown, and if its prospects recover, it could be significantly discounted. Reward Potential In Coinbase As an analyst, I am generally skeptical of unprofitable technology firms and, for the past two years, have carried a bearish bias in most of my research. In my view, Coinbase is one of the few examples where I see a solid contrarian bullish argument today. It goes without saying that COIN is a very high-risk stock subject to immense volatility and numerous fundamental risks that could jeopardize the firm. However, COIN price-to-book value has declined by a staggering 95% since inception to 1.4X today. Two years ago, COIN's valuation was tremendously high compared to traditional brokers; today, it is well below that of Schwab ( SCHW ), Interactive Brokers ( IBKR ), and others (from a price-to-book standpoint). Thus, I believe COIN's risk profile is generally accounted for in its valuation. If we assume that the ""bottom will not fall out"" of the cryptocurrency market, Coinbase may return as a market-share leader among exchanges. Due to its age, business focus, and public status Coinbase objectively has the greatest trustworthiness and security in the industry. Crypto investors pay a premium to use Coinbase's services. Still, in my view, that premium is relatively small compared to the tremendous losses suffered by FTX users that lost ""secured"" funds. With auditors pulling away from giants like Kraken, I believe more prominent long-term crypto investors may gravitate toward more-secure public firms like Coinbase. Additionally, with Bitcoin (and peers) at extreme lows, there will likely be an increase in long-term investors in the market as opposed to short-term traders and speculators. Coinbase is a poor platform for cryptocurrency trading due to its higher fees, but it is a superior option for long-term investors due to its security. Thus, I believe Coinbase may have competitive dominance with Bitcoin at low prices and with crypto investor trust as weak as it is. The potential upside in COIN is challenging to calculate since there are many pathways the future may hold. If the company can regain its late 2021 TTM EPS level of $9-$12, its ""P/E"" today would be ~3-4X - which is extremely low. That could occur if trading activity and bullish flows return to the cryptocurrency market, potentially causing COIN to rise over $100. Of course, if there is a widespread shift in assets toward Coinbase as investors move toward more trustworthy exchanges, COIN could rise much higher as it regains the market share dominance it held many years ago. The Bottom Line While COIN is exposed to considerable downside risks, its upside potential is also tremendous. In my view, the company is priced as if it is likely that the cryptocurrency industry will collapse. Indeed, I do not believe this is impossible as there is no physical value in cryptocurrencies, with their value in my opinion largely stemming from beliefs surrounding fiat currencies and trust in alternatives. The value of emotional beliefs should not be discounted, but they are fickle. However, with faith in traditional fiat currencies waning and objective risks rising rapidly, I tend to believe that some cryptocurrencies will retain value over the long run as more people globally seek to reduce exposure to government-controlled assets. Public trust in institutions is at (or near) all-time lows in virtually all categories, creating immense potential value for alternative structures. While there are considerable risks within the cryptocurrency industry, it is a potentially viable alternative structure. In this sense, COIN is a potential hedge against generalized social, political, and economic risks. Looking at the market today, I am not so bullish on COIN that I would buy the stock; but I have a positive long-term view of the stock on balance. COIN also carries considerable short-term upside potential if a short-squeeze occurs due to its immense short exposure. Personally, I would not make that particular speculative bet today, but it is a factor that could lead to rapid gains for the stock. Once cryptocurrency volatility settles down and Bitcoin carves a more stable support level, I may become very bullish on COIN.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4567647-coinbase-may-soar-2023-crypto-investors-flock-safe-haven-exchanges?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/6995371.jpeg

We believe cryptocurrencies are a speculative bubble of the highest order and volumes will continue to trend lower. One cannot rule out a bounce for Coinbase but we think the longer-term trajectory remains firmly down. When we wrote about Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) in August 2022, we told investors that this stood as one of the worst picks within the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF's ( ARKW ) holdings. That was quite an honor in a line-up filled with some rather illustrious money losers. Specifically we said, The Q2-2022 results were just breathtakingly bad and it was a special treat to see just how far off base the bulls were on this one. The company reported revenues that almost dropped by two thirds (growth stock, so why not) and it managed to lose $1.24 billion pre-tax on $800 million of revenues. Stock based compensation is making up 60% of revenues. Do you expect this firm to ever hit profitability? Our answer is no and we expect the firm will likely visit single digits pretty soon. Source: When Growth Is Ashes, You Have My Permission To Buy COIN has not reached single digits, but the trend is definitely your friend. Data by YCharts We examine the recent developments and the analyst sentiment to update our thesis. Q3-2022 While we have often had a pessimistic bent on a certain genre of stocks, it does occasionally happen that a few do far worse than even what we envisioned. COIN's third quarter was something like that with net revenues dropping about 55%. COIN Q3-2022 Letter 55% revenue drops are not at all common even in the middle of recessions for most types of companies. Of course, when the base of your business is built on cryptocurrencies, things accelerate down when there is no one left to buy. The 55% revenue drop was made worse by the fact that expenses went up 12.35%. Only transaction expense matched the revenue decline and increases in the general and administrative expense category was a horror show. The bleed was strong and COIN lost $2.43 in one quarter. For the growth groupies out there, COIN did have one spectacular growing number to report. Unfortunately, it was in stock based compensation which is now annualizing to $1.6 billion. COIN Q3-2022 Letter Outlook All other things being equal, Wall Street will be bullish. That truism applies here as well as we look at estimates. Here is a look at the revenue estimates for 2022 to 2024. We have circled the average and the low-end numbers. Seeking Alpha-COIN The consensus has basically gone ""this is a one-off quarter, and revenues will rebound strongly in 2023."" That is what they are saying considering that COIN's last quarter was at a $2.2 billion annualized run-rate. At the low end we have some who are annualizing the last quarter run-rate. The reality is likely to be far more grim. Q3-2022 was just the tip of the cryptocurrency implosion and volumes dropped so much. Q4-2022 is where all the good things happened as Sam Bankman-Fried's assets got deep fried from $11 billion to zero as FTX went under . We think it is sheer insanity to assume that there is going to be more capital to trade these ""instruments"" in 2023, but that is exactly what analysts are forecasting. Our take here is that we will see a $350 million quarterly run-rate in 2023, leading to $1.4 billion of revenues. That is our absolute best-case scenario. Even at that level, stock-based compensation will be higher than revenues. Based on the operating expense run-rate, which COIN has made a zero effort to pull back to date, we see losses in the order of $3-$4 billion in 2023. Forecasting exact losses per share will be difficult. COIN's share count is the only thing that is growing and we expect that to accelerate in 2023. Data by YCharts But roughly we think losses per share will be in the range of $16-$19 for 2023. Of course, in line with the optimism on revenues, Wall Street analysts are telling you that it will be just a little prick. Seeking Alpha-COIN Well, you know our outlook and we are happy to compare notes in a year. We think things will blow up spectacularly as everyone suddenly realizes that we are still searching for the first real use for cryptocurrencies. Verdict As we see the trajectory to single digits that we spoke about in August, two things give us pause. The first being that the stock is very oversold on shorter time frames. Even COIN's 200 day moving average is more than twice the current price. Data by YCharts The other point is that short interest hit a new high recently. Data by YCharts So anyone taking a short sale risk here has to be aware that you can get demolished when points 1 and 2 combine. That said our call is for the next 12 months and we think that COIN will continue its journey down. Please note that this is not financial advice. It may seem like it, sound like it, but surprisingly, it is not. Investors are expected to do their own due diligence and consult with a professional who knows their objectives and constraints.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4567641-coinbase-model-is-broken?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/6993244.jpeg

This Obstacle Stalls Gains","The Bitcoin price has seen a slow start in 2023 as the cryptocurrency remains stalled and moving sideways around its current levels. Many experts believe BTC has seen the worst of the recent bearish cycle and could be gearing up for some profits. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Ethereum Lack Volumes To Justify Caps, Says Santiment As of this writing, the Bitcoin price trades at $16,700 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours and the previous seven days. The low trading volume and low activity because of the holiday contributed to the current price action. The Bitcoin Price Near A Bottom, But Profits Remain Elusive According to analyst Caleb Franzen, the Bitcoin price registered another indication of a bottom. Franzen and others have been tracking down the clues that could support a bullish thesis for BTC, and the Heikin Ashi printed a positive signal. The Heikin Ashi is a technique to visualize price action and create candlestick charts to measure trends in a market. Franzen claims the Bitcoin price printed its 13th consecutive monthly Heikin Ashi on December 22. The last time BTC saw a similar trend was at the end of the 2018 and 2015 bear markets. This data supports a positive outlook for the Bitcoin price and hints at a bullish potential in the coming months. The analyst stated: Each red streak has been longer than the last & we’re currently building #14 for January ’23. Historically, a green monthly candle after 5+ red monthly candles has marked the end of each bear market. As mentioned, Franzen and other metrics point to Bitcoin forming a bottom at its current levels. Crypto exchange Coinbase claims that 50% of BTC investors present losses. In previous bear cycles, this metric reaching 50% coincided with a “sold base for a macro market bottom,” the report from Coinbase claims: These represent major inflection points for BTC performance, preceding subsequent periods of price appreciation, we believe this metric provides important insights into current cycle positioning. The Bitcoin price must clear a $14 million sell wall at $17,000 to take a first step in this direction.

6992907,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514525,1672786805,"Santiment Paints Bullish Picture For XRP, But This May Not Be The Case","XRP price is having a shaky start to the year 2023 after a sharp drop on Monday during Asia hours. The digital asset eventually recovered but it remains shaky even now a new report from Santiment shows that there could be a bull case for the cryptocurrency. This bull case is tied to large XRP holders who have been accumulating coins over the past six months. A Bull Case For XRP The report from Santiment starts out with the revelation that large investors holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP tokens have been increasing their bags aggressively. Apparently, over the last six years, these investors raised their collective balances by 25%. This now meant that they were holding more than 4 billion XRP. Related Reading: SOL Jumps 15% In 24 Hours As Solana Receives Support From Ethereum Founder Santiment notes that such accumulation trends were important given that they are often observed during bear market bottoms. Basically, when these whales go on a buying spree such as this, it is when the price has already reached its lowest point in the bear market. So if history is anything to go by and this was to have the same effects as previously seen, then it could mean that there is a bull rally in scope for the digital asset. Additionally, it explains that the MVRV 30 for the altcoin shows that short-term holders were seeing losses of 7% on average. So this points to a hesitancy to sell among these holders because they do not want to take a loss. This refusal to dump tokens and whales adding to their balances adds up to less supply hitting the market while demand is on the rise. Basic laws of economics will easily put this as a recipe for a jump in the price of assets, hence the bull case for XRP. XRP price continues to struggle at $0.34 | Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com But What If This Isn’t The Case? One thing that XRP holders have to take into account is the Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple. This case is yet to be concluded and it continues to put a damper on the price of XRP. To know just how much of an effect it had, while most cryptocurrencies in the market were hitting new all-time highs, XRP’s price had declined, unable to even reclaim its own all-time high price from 2018.

The only thing that can categorically determine if there is a bull rally coming for the altcoin would be for the outcome of the case to be in favor of Ripple. Until then, the price of the digital asset is expected to trade sideways, as well as lag behind the general crypto market.

Extraordinary short interest could generate a covering spree (squeeze) soon, alongside January Effect buying. A buyout offer from a major bank or brokerage wanting to own the leading position in the crypto exchange space cannot be ruled out. I am lifting my rating from Sell to Hold. I wrote a bearish Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) article in September 2021 here , explaining the company’s operations and cryptocurrencies in general were headed for a bust. Of course, most of the commenters called me an idiot, not understanding the glorious future of intangible, computer-generated money creations or the enterprises like Coinbase trying to ride the easy-money boom in these new speculative inventions. Seeking Alpha – Paul Franke, Coinbase Article, September 16th, 2022 Well, COIN’s share price has declined -87% from my article posting, dropping from $243 to $35 last week, over 15 months of steady liquidation. Short sellers now dominate trading, with a good 24% of share float borrowed and sold down the river. Operating profits (especially the GAAP variety) are actually negative losses during the ongoing cryptocurrency implosion, and nearly every article on Seeking Alpha is screaming at investors to sell the company. I am not having a radical change of heart, but I think the possibility of a serious short squeeze on any good news in the world could cause a frenzy of equity and cryptocurrency buying (examples include Russia’s Putin dying, which might bring an end to the Ukraine war quickly; China surviving its COVID winter, and actually recovering and fully reopening by early summer; the Federal Reserve switching teams to an easing, lower-rate policy; or China-Taiwan negotiating a peaceful 50-year transition of political power). I know it’s hard to visualize such happening after the rotten 2022 bust performance in cryptocurrencies and the stock market, but things do change. To me at $35, with a tangible book value around $21 per share, and a real-world setup as the top crypto exchange, the downside argument of Coinbase going out of business, and falling to $0 for price is rather improbable. What if a large financial institution like Goldman Sachs ( GS ) or JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) decides now is the time to purchase Coinbase on the cheap? Don’t say it cannot happen. Maybe a bid for $50 or $60 per share is coming in the first half of next year. So, hold on to your britches. Although I still believe cryptocurrencies will decline in 2023 again, perhaps dramatically, Coinbase’s share quote may actually stabilize or rise during the year! I am upgrading my view of its stock from Sell to Hold/Neutral . That doesn’t mean a $25 or $20 price in the opening months of 2023 will not take place. All I am saying is the risk of a rebound is about the same as the risk of steep future declines. I would rather focus buying and selling attention on other opportunities. Seeking Alpha Table - Coinbase, Analyst Consensus Estimates, 2022-24, December 31st, 2022 Valuation Ideas $5 billion in cash held on the balance sheet vs. $3.7 billion in total debt (at the end of September), and an equity market capitalization of $8 billion does not highlight anything close to a Strong Sell , even with operating losses again in 2023. From its bubble IPO valuation of 40x sales and 20x tangible book value in early 2021, today’s 2.1x trailing sales and 1.6x tangible book value ratios look like any other S&P 500 company. I could even argue valuations are cheaper now than many large financial institutions, meaning any unexpected jump in cryptocurrency pricing and/or acceptance by businesses as a form of transaction payment could produce a monster rebound in Coinbase shares. YCharts - Coinbase, Price to Trailing Sales & Tangible Book Value, Since April 2021 YCharts - Coinbase vs. Major U.S. Financials, Price to Trailing Sales, Since April 2021 YCharts - Coinbase vs. Major U.S. Financials, Price to Tangible Book Value, Since April 2021 Stretched Short Position Am I suggesting you run out and buy Coinbase shares? No, the risk of a complete and total bust in cryptos could drag the share price lower over time. Company sales could be negatively affected by both lower trading volumes (investor interest) and crypto trade prices, while operating losses will mean book values are in decline. However, I would definitely rethink a short position and cover before any squeeze appears. Below is a graph of the sharp rise in short selling volumes and stats. At 24% of the float and 17% of shares outstanding, the level of bearish trade positioning has doubled since the spring of 2022. Assuming a change in attitudes toward a bullish outlook appears, it will be next to impossible for shorts to cover their borrowed shares without a sizable price increase, as they fight for supply with new buyers. YCharts - Coinbase, Short Selling Stats, Since April 2021 Technical Trading Chart A very large portion of my favorite momentum indicators are flashing sell, and this would be your expectation looking at the collapse in price since November 2021. However, ""bust"" charts like Coinbase often reverse sharply with little warning. And, we could be getting close to a January Effect bounce, where big stock losers of the previous year recover some in price as tax-loss selling subsides. Several indicators are hinting such a rebound may be next in Coinbase shares. I have drawn a daily chart of volume and price changes below, beginning from the IPO date in April 2021. For starters, the 14-day Ease of Movement calculation is telegraphing heavy selling volumes are necessary day-in and day-out to keep pressure on the stock quote (boxed in green). Second, a subtle change in the behavior of the Negative Volume Index (marked with a red arrow) is signally some buying on weakness is taking place on slower volume days. This has never happened before December 2022. It could be short covering, if I had to guess. Third, an oversold condition on the 14-day Money Flow Index (marked with blue circle) now exists that suggests decent odds of intense selling pressure relaxing a bit in January. Taken together, these three momentum indicators may be laying the groundwork for some sort of bottom in the days ahead (if not reached last week). Of course, any new drop in cryptocurrency prices would surely mean COIN selling will continue. I would watch general price levels in the space for clues. StockCharts.com - Coinbase, Daily Price and Volume Changes, Author Reference Points, Since April 2021 Final Thoughts I am modeling one last move lower in stocks will coincide with the start of a U.S. recession in Q1 or Q2 2023. Both a recession and falling equity quotes would then cause the Federal Reserve to begin easing aggressively again to prevent a worsening macroeconomic situation by late 2023. I am not a cryptocurrency expert, but believe a gradual slide in trade values for the sector will remain a problem until the Fed goes crazy with its fiat paper money printing presses. At that point, maybe demand for cryptos will reverse into a multi-year uptrend. If crypto pricing survives another year without a total collapse, who knows, maybe a bull move could play out in late 2023 and 2024. Such would mean Coinbase’s immediate future is not the going-out-of-business kind, but something akin to a sector-related depression in activity and interest. At least, that’s the strongest bullish case I can dream up, trading various booms/busts since 1986. Having said that, I am a bigger believer in gold and silver for 2023, as they will be the main beneficiaries of a new round of Fed easing. I am even on record suggesting gold prices will eventually surpass Bitcoin , possibly into 2024. Does this mean cryptos are dead money forever? No. Does this mean Coinbase will never fully recover to its IPO price and valuation? Absolutely. In my opinion, COIN was part of a crazy mania move that will never be repeated by cryptocurrencies. However, I suspect computer-money will remain part of our lives, and Coinbase may be able to generate decent profits off its exchange/banking business a few years out, after government rules/regulations are put into place to protect the marketplace from fraud, and some confidence by stung users and investors re-emerges. I am estimating the odds of $20 per share are about the same as $50 in 12 months. So, with a current $35 COIN price, I am looking at other stock market names for my money. If you already own a position, holding for a rebound makes some sense. I might consider buying a position at prices in the mid-$20s, if shares continue to decline in the first few months of 2023.

While bearish sentiment is still high as signaled by the 23% short interest, investors need to look beyond the current pessimism. Crypto trading volumes and COIN's financial performance have been negatively impacted by rising interest rates, so the expected peak in rates in 2023 is a positive sign. COIN has been investing in building its scale and improving its competitiveness in recent years, increasing R&D expenses significantly. It could be wise to start building a position in anticipation of improved cryptocurrency trading volumes once interest rates peak in 2023. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) fell around 65% in 2022, marking its worst year since 2018 when it lost approx. 74% of its value. The main reason for the cryptocurrency's fall in 2022 was the increase in interest rates in the US and other countries that mirror the Fed's policy actions. When interest rates increase, asset prices for riskier assets like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies usually decline as investors shy away from them in favor of high returns on risk-free investments. The plunge in the value of bitcoin and other tokens has led to an investor exodus in the broader cryptocurrency space. Coinbase Global ( COIN ) has not been spared. The crypto exchange lost more than 85% of its value on the stock market in 2022. COIN currently sports a market cap of $7.89 billion, a far cry from the lofty $65 billion market cap it commanded when it debuted as a publicly traded company in April 2021. Bearish sentiment Even after COIN's dramatic crash in 2022, investors are still not convinced that the stock has upside potential. COIN has a notably high short interest of 23.89%, indicating that bearish sentiment is still high. This pessimism is, in my opinion, unjustifiably high and the stock is worth watching for buy opportunities over the next two to three quarters. The reason investors are bearish on COIN is that its revenues (primarily derived from trading fees) and margins have declined amid a drop in the volume and value of transactions in the cryptocurrency space. For Q3 2022 , COIN's trading volume was $159B vs. $217B in Q2 and $327B in Q3 of 2021. As long as trading volumes in cryptocurrencies remain subdued in relation to historical levels, which is the expectation based on current interest rates, I believe COIN is unlikely to stage a strong recovery in its financial performance. Analysts expect revenue of $3.18 billion in 2022 and $3.36 billion in 2023 vs revenues of $7.35 billion in 2021 and $1.14 billion in 2020. EBITDA for the trailing twelve months is $100.80 million vs $4.53 billion in 2021 and $582.3 million in 2020. Building scale and investing in competitiveness COIN's compressed margins are not just a function of the decline in its revenue, but also the result of it spending more on its operations in order to maintain a competitive edge in an increasingly crowded industry. There are more than 100 active crypto exchanges today, each offering more or less the same products and services. COIN is currently the second largest exchange after Binance, according to CoinMarketCap , which ranks and scores exchanges based on traffic, liquidity, trading volumes and confidence in the legitimacy of trading volumes reported. To maintain this market-leading position, COIN has inevitably had to increase its investments in operations and research and development. The table below, which utilizes figures drawn from the company's income statement, illustrates this. 2020 2021 TTM Selling, general and administrative expenses $335.6 million $1.56 billion $2.17 billion R&D expenses $271.7 million $1.29 billion $2.19 billion I believe it is a bullish sign for a company to invest in building scale and competitiveness when it is operating in a crowded and competitive industry like crypto. This is a point that bears are missing. There are also a few more positives worth discussing. For example, COIN has been able to offset the weakness in its underlying business by increasing its exposure to interest-earning assets at a time of higher rates. Its interest income in Q3 2022 was $101.78M compared with just $8.39M a year ago. Increased interest income is a positive development that has not received as much attention from investors. COIN has also been able to retain the majority of its users in the past few years, even though they are understandably trading less than they did during the crypto bull market of 2021. Monthly transacting users (MTUs) were 8.5 million in Q3 2021, down from 9.0 million in Q2 but up from 7.3 million in Q3 2021. For 2022, the company expects to see MTUs at the top end of its outlook of 7 - 9 million users. An engaged user base and increased investments in operations and R&D are critical ingredients for success that COIN already possesses. When interest rates peak and trading in cryptocurrencies start growing again, COIN will be well-positioned to resume a solid growth trajectory. While it's impossible to predict when interest rates will peak, and how long the Fed will take before it eases financial conditions again, most economists expect rate hikes to stop in 2023 . This makes COIN a potentially good buy amid the pessimism that has weighed on the share price, thus presenting a potential discount. Key risks to watch COIN is not a set-and-forget investment and bulls need to beware of the risks. The main one is the fact that the company is investing in operations and R&D at a time of depressed revenue. This could lead to an imminent capital raise, which in the short term tends to hurt the share price because of dilution or increased leverage. Similarly, the cryptocurrency space has been riddled with scandals, the most notorious one being the FTX (FTT-USD) fiasco. COIN has so far maintained a clean track record but this has not shielded the stock from the negative sentiment that has permeated the crypto space. This is another risk investors need to be mindful of. Valuation is another risk as there are not many comparable publicly traded companies that one can use to determine whether COIN is overvalued, fairly valued or undervalued. Moreover, the fact that it has slipped into losses in 2022 also means that price/sales is the best valuation metric to use at the moment. I personally do not trust price/sales when used in isolation, so COIN's price/sales of 2.47x doesn't tell me much about the stock's valuation and potential upside or downside. Bigger picture In conclusion, investors need to look at the bigger picture, which is the fact that crypto is now an established asset class. Many institutional players are now involved and the risk of regulatory crackdown is overstated given the current downturn and scandals have not posed any systemic risks worthy of intervention. The current negative cycle will come to an end. Taking advantage of the bearish sentiment to build a stake in well-positioned players like COIN could be a smart move. The stock could surprise to the upside once rates peak.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4567627-coinbase-take-advantage-of-pessimism-and-accumulate?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/6990735.jpeg

42413266,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8Exc,1672782918,Web3 Co-Working Hub EmpireDAO Closes Amid Bear Market Woes,"As an extended crypto winter continues to put pressure on Web3 businesses, EmpireDAO, the crypto co-working space founded by entrepreneur Mike Fraietta in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, is feeling the frost.  The New York City office building was tapped to become the WeWork of Web3 at the historic 190 Bowery, but less than a year after opening Fraietta is looking to move elsewhere.  “We tried every which way to get new sponsors, partnerships and even crowdfunding,” Fraietta said. “But we needed more help to sustain at 190 Bowery.”  Fraietta attempted a last-minute crowdfunding campaign to save the EmpireDAO office space in December 2022, with hopes of raising 215 ETH (about $260,000). But the effort ultimately fell short, receiving just 27 donations for a total of 6.71 ETH, or about $8,100 at the time of writing.  Since Fraietta began leasing the building in March, EmpireDAO has amassed a community of over 1,500 members and around 300 visitors each day to its office. It officially opened its doors in June, according to Fraietta.  While EmpireDAO’s SoHo location is shutting its doors, Fraietta has plans to eventually re-open in another spot for “Season 2” of the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), along with potential EmpireDAO pop-ups at upcoming crypto conferences, as well as this year’s SXSW in Austin, Texas, in partnership with ATX DAO.  “The focus is now on making a clean exodus at 190 Bowery,” Fraietta said.  The announcement of EmpireDAO’s closure was met with hundreds of supportive comments in the group’s Telegram chat.  “Thank you for opening the doors both literally and figuratively to so many people, projects, minds and movements,” one user wrote. EmpireDAO “really became my home,” said another.  The news comes amid a larger crypto winter that has shuttered momentum for many Web3 startups, with new capital hard to come by. When EmpireDAO began its lease in March, the price of ETH was around $3,140, 163% higher than its current price of roughly $1,210.

42421408,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXo3WH,1672780662,The Right (and Wrong Way) to Get Web3 Adoption,"Last week, there was a small uproar in the Web 3 world when a new protocol, DeSo, announced an update to its user login flow. Previously, the decentralized media service had asked users to enter their “seed phrase” into the project’s web interface, defying all generally accepted best security practices and drawing criticism across the industry.  “Chrome extensions like MetaMask are more secure, but most mainstream users will never install them. Instead of yelling at our users about security best practices, we did something radical: We met them where they are today,” explained DeSo’s founder, Nader Al-Naji. The team found, however, that they had not actually met users where they were given that “10% of people lost their seed immediately.”  Jill Gunter, a CoinDesk columnist, is a venture partner with Slow Ventures, where she invests in early-stage crypto and Web3 projects. She is also a co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system.  To address this issue, DeSo now offers users the ability to automatically back up their seed phrases to Google Drive from within the application. If anything, this is even worse from a security perspective than their original login flow.  When it comes to seed phrases, the generally accepted best practice is never to store them on any device that is connected to (or has been connected to) the internet. These 12-, 18- or 24-word phrases are what enable users to recover the assets stored in a given digital wallet should they lose or replace the device they used to access their funds. Seed phrases are so sensitive because they allow anybody who knows their magic words to gain access to the associated assets.  Read More: DeSo Wants Your Seed Phrase. Let Them Come and Take It  Most crypto and Web 3 applications encourage users to write down their seed phrases and store them somewhere secure, such as a bunker or a physical safe deposit box. Do not tell anyone. Do not store the phrase in an online password manager, the wisdom goes, let alone in your Google Drive. And do not ever enter your seed phrase into a website form, lest you become the victim of a phishing attack.  And yet, my experience of interacting with all kinds of crypto and Web 3 users suggests that few take this wisdom on board. It is easy to empathize with DeSo’s predicament.  I have fielded many messages from friends who only lightly dabble in crypto asking me for help in remembering “what 12-word sentence” they might have used to back up the bitcoin wallet they set up in 2017. (As a note: unlike a password, users do not decide what their seed phrase should be; it is instead generated for them. Which is yet another point of friction and confusion for users to overcome.)  I have seen seed phrases scribbled in notebooks left in backpacks under the counters at bars during crypto conferences. I have acted as customer support on crypto projects and had users message me with their private keys (despite my admonitions not to) asking for help. I have seen users post their private keys in Discord channels. I, myself, only a couple of weeks ago came across 24 words scribbled down on a Post-It note in the bottom of a purse I frequently used a few years ago. I doubt that I will ever know what wallet it is associated with.  In light of these observations and experiences, it is tempting to shrug and say that maybe DeSo has it right. For the average user just dabbling in Web 3 for the first time, maybe it is the most sensible approach to store seed phrases somewhere like Google Drive. Better there than in a sock drawer, right?  Problem is, even if today the stakes for the average user would be low in keeping their keys in Google Drive, down the line the consequences may become financially significant. It seems that every year, the media becomes fixated on some other poor sap who bought bitcoin in 2011, made hundreds of millions of dollars, but lost their seed phrase and can no longer access the funds (the guy who lost half a billion in a dump in Wales comes to mind).  While DeSo users who store their seed phrases in Google Drive will not have to worry about losing track of the seed phrase, they will have to worry about their Google account becoming a target for hackers. If lots of early adopters of the protocol do become millionaires off of the assets they have stored within the DeSo system, then suddenly Google Drive will become an enormous honeypot for all of them. This is dangerous for users – and presumably a situation that DeSo would like to avoid.  For the industry, there is an even bigger problem with DeSo’s approach. It is teaching users to do things that are dangerous without adequately explaining to them what the risks are. DeSo is neither educating users nor mitigating the risks they are asking users to take on. DeSo is merely cutting corners and creating problematic habits that users will take with them when they go to use other Web 3 applications.  The user experience of accessing and engaging with crypto remains an unsolved problem. Web 3 and crypto almost definitionally ask users to take on more responsibility when engaging with the internet. The responsibilities and challenges arise well beyond the problem of seed phrase storage. Many hardcore crypto proponents advocate for users to run their own nodes for the protocols they interact with. Users regularly have to navigate block explorers to view transaction details, wrap and unwrap assets into different token standards, and, of course, deal with expensive, opaque and unpredictable fees.  Much of crypto reverses what Web 2 has trained users to expect and feel comfortable with. With the trusted, free, seamless applications of Web 2, users can port across devices that open and unfold with a mere glance or a buzz on a wristwatch, often without so much as entering a password. That stands in stark contrast to Web 3 and its device-siloed, security-intensive experience that asks users to navigate inscrutable flows, often with little education or instruction embedded in the product.  And therein lies a key part of the user experience solution: education. We should not think so little of users that we have to cut corners for them, as DeSo does. After all, a core principle of crypto lies in the empowerment of the individual. Teach users about their options and the associated risks (including, indeed, the options of storing a seed phrase in Google Drive), and let them choose.  When I think about the user experience of Web 3 today, I am often brought back to my earliest experiences using a computer and the internet. I recall, as a 5- or 6-year-old, looking on as my uncle set up a Gateway computer for my parents in our family room and hooked us up, for the first time, to dial-up internet. He was using all kinds of jargon that would become native to us all over the next 10 years, but to my parents was clearly foreign and uncomfortable.  The “operating system,” the “modem,” the “IP address.” I can still remember the aura of skepticism and exhaustion my parents seemed to share once my uncle had left that afternoon. As if they were thinking: “There’s no way we are ever going to figure out how to use this.”  Read more: DeSo Launches $50M Fund for Decentralized Social Ecosystem  But we all figured it out! The average computer user may not be able to give you the precise, technically accurate explanation of the role an operating system plays on their computer, or why a modem is needed or how an IP address is derived. But billions of us have figured out how to upgrade an operating system, plug in a modem and connect to Wi-Fi networks. Some of this has come down to innovation in user experience, but much of it has simply resulted from user education combined, importantly, with strong incentives for users to get up to speed. Once I caught a glimpse of what that old desktop computer connected to the internet could offer me, I made it my business to understand what I needed to be able to use it. Neopets and America Online were enough to motivate me to figure it out in all of its complexity.  The same is, and will continue to be, true of crypto and Web 3. With a strong enough value proposition, concerns about users balking and churning at the prospect of downloading a Chrome plugin or having to securely store a 12-word phrase will diminish for product builders. That is not to say that we should not still work to improve these experiences. It is only to say that we should not assume that we have to go to the extreme measures of cutting corners to onboard users. We ought to give them more credit than that. And if cutting corners is what it takes to users to pick up your product, then perhaps you should re-examine whether your product is actually providing sufficient value.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | RESEARCH,Jill Gunter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/03/the-right-and-wrong-way-to-get-web3-adoption,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2eebd5b61b1906ce72f1f3b44ebf4320cf7472fc-1400x969.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42420864,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtVs5,1672780430,Crypto Markets Analysis: Bitcoin Muddles Along; Consumer Credit Debt Could Present Problems,"In the final week of 2022, bitcoin’s tepid price movement veered from a recent, year-end pattern of wide swings stemming largely from investors' anticipation of heightened volatility.  Bitcoin moved just 1.6% last year compared to 7% and 20% shifts in 2021 and 2020, respectively.  The weak price action capped a disappointing 2022 for BTC – a year that was hard on risk assets as the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, plummeted 33% and 19%, respectively.  For the first time in its history, bitcoin’s price declined in four consecutive quarters.  ETH barely avoided this distinction after rising in the third quarter largely on the strength of the Ethereum Merge, which shifted the Ethereum protocol from proof-of-work to more energy-efficient proof-of-stake.  The limited price movement indicates that demand for the asset class is weak. Lack of volatility is often unappealing to short-term traders. Looming macroeconomic hurdles have also soured retail investors.  For now, BTC seems most attractive to patient, long-term bullish investors, looking to accumulate at a perceived discount.  Looking ahead, the same crypto ballad of woe still has a few notes left, despite investor hopefulness that the bear market will peter out.  Liquidity continues to ring loudly. The U.S. Federal Reserve remains committed to reducing inflation via interest rate increases and balance sheet reductions.  “M2” money supply for the U.S. decreased in 2022, as the Federal Reserve worked to slow inflation. Money supply in the eurozone declined in each of the last two months, although the money supply in China and Japan actually rose.  The push and pull between inflation control and economic stimulus in the world’s two largest economies by gross domestic product (GDP) remains unsettling for global asset markets.  A disconnect also exists between the extension of credit to corporations and the growth of revolving credit among individual consumers.  While the total credit issued to corporations has declined as a percentage of GDP, total credit card debt to consumers has risen.  Though not a completely apples-to-apples comparison, the difference implies that reduced access to credit is reining in corporate expansion. Still, consumers appear to have loaded up on potentially troublesome debt. There was an understandable decline in revolving debt in 2020, in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, however, consumer revolving debt levels have increased to all- time highs. The following dynamic appears to be present:  Economic stimulus added to the money supply and resultant inflation  Consumers increased their personal debt levels  The fight against inflation has led to increased interest rates, economic slowing and possible higher unemployment  But consumer debt most assuredly has to be repaid, even as high inflation lingers and growth brakes.  Given the large role that retail investors play in crypto investment, repayment obligations could reduce discretionary investing capital, adding another hurdle to crypto markets.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/03/crypto-markets-analysis-bitcoin-muddles-along-consumer-credit-debt-could-present-problems,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/edc48684762264ff8c01b31e3fb6cbf7b469f448-6016x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

6985738,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514608,1672778062,Currency Expert Explains Why Altcoins Experience More Carnage Than Bitcoin And Ethereum,"As the current bear market in crypto continues to deepen, Bitcoin has fallen by 78%, and Ethereum by 82%. Yet elsewhere in the crypto market, many altcoins are down by as much as 96% or more. In a recent video, Elliott Wave International Currency & Crypto Analyst Jason Soni sheds some light on why this occurs and what this could mean for various cryptocurrencies. Breaking Down Why Some Crypto Assets Crash More Than Others Bitcoin price has retraced by more than 78% from all-time highs set back in 2021. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, saw an approximately 82% retracement from peak to trough thus far. As you move down the ranks of cryptocurrencies, the total drawdown figures deepen. Cardano, for example, suffered a 92% collapse compared to the top two cryptocurrencies. Solana, once pegged to disrupt Ethereum, dropped by a staggering 96%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: What Elliott Wave Theory Suggests Is Next For BTC In a new video entitled “Looking at Opportunities for the Next Crypto Bull Market,” Elliott Wave International Currency & Crypto Analyst Jason Soni touches on why – theoretically – this discrepancy exists. According to Soni, newer altcoins in their first cycle will see the deepest retracement. As cryptocurrencies mature, and go through more boom and bust cycles, retracements are less steep, like we’ve seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum. ETH 2018 versus ADA 2022 | ETHUSD on TradingView.com Bitcoin Sets The Standard For Bear Market Corrections In the video, Jason Soni used a comparison between many newer altcoins today following a similar trajectory and total drawdown as 2018 Ethereum. With each new cycle, new participants join and liquidity in each asset increases, reducing volatility over time and resulting in less and less in terms of max drawdown. This is perhaps the most visible with Bitcoin. Following Bitcoin’s first major bull market, the first ever crypto asset retraced by 96%. In the second bear market ever in crypto, BTC retraced by 86%. During the 2018 bear market, Bitcoin sank by a grand total of 84%. A softer landing yet might still be possible during this bear market. Related Reading: Solana Suffers Double-Digit Losses, Is There An End In Sight? Considering the severity of the drawdowns in most cryptocurrencies and the extreme negative sentiment, it could mean that the end of the bear market is near.

The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is up 1.3% so far in 2023, with all six sector indexes in the green. That’s a reversal from the fourth quarter of last year when the benchmark index slid 12% from September through Dec. 15.  “The entire market is generally stabilizing, accompanied by apathetic market participation,” Arcane Research, which provides analysis of digital asset trends, wrote in a newsletter on Tuesday.  Lido DAO (LDO), the governance token of the Lido decentralized autonomous organization, grabbed the trophy as the top performer so far in 2023 in CMI.  The LDO token’s price has risen from 95 cents at the end of 2022 to $1.20 on the third day of the new year, surging 26% so far in 2023, according to data from CoinGecko. The rally follows Ethereum developers' Dec. 8 announcement that the network's next hard fork that will take place in March.  LDO is one of 142 assets out of 163 assets in the CoinDesk Market Index that are trading higher so far in 2023, with 25 assets trading more than 5% above their closing levels on the last day of 2022.  Runner-up JasmyCoin (JASMY), the token of a platform that develops internet of things (IoT) flipped the downward momentum from the 4th quarter of 2022 and gained 20% in the new year so far. Maple Finance’s native MPL token has also seen a roughly 15% increase.  Solana's SOL has surged roughly 12% in 2023 so far and about 20% in the past 24 hours as a decision by newly launched shiba inu-themed token Bonk to do a large airdrop generated interest in the Solana community.  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) have also held strong so far this year despite being down 0.4% and 0.8% in the past 24 hours.  Bitcoin has hovered between $16,000 and $17,000 for 19 consecutive days, after a horrendous 2022 during which the largest cryptocurrency lost 64%.  Looking at sector performance, CoinDesk Market Index sector indexes are in the green across the board during the first few days of the year, led by the Culture and Entertainment sector, up 5% through Tuesday.

42413265,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8Evk,1672775263,"US Federal Reserve, Other Agencies Continue to Warn Banks About Crypto","The U.S. Federal Reserve and other regulators issued a crypto warning for the banking system Tuesday, though the statement doesn’t extend any new policies about how traditional lenders deal with digital assets.  “Given the significant risks highlighted by recent failures of several large crypto-asset companies, the agencies continue to take a careful and cautious approach related to current or proposed crypto-asset-related activities and exposures at each banking organization,” according to the statement from agencies that also included the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC).  Issuing digital tokens or holding them on their own balance sheets “is highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices,” the agencies argued. The three regulators said they have “significant safety and soundness concerns with business models that are concentrated in crypto-asset-related activities.”  The U.S. banking regulators have maintained a careful resistance to cryptocurrency getting a significant toehold in the traditional financial system. They’ve allowed some custody operations among lenders, and the OCC briefly extended provisional charters to crypto trust banks, but the rules at the agencies now hold that a lender must get approval in advance before getting into any new business involving this sector.

The onetime billionaire, before U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan, entered his plea to eight criminal counts ranging from wire fraud to conspiracy to pursue money laundering, Reuters noted. If convicted, the 30-year-old, who has been accused of defrauding investors and FTX customers, could face up to 115 years in prison. Kaplan was said to have set an October 2 trial date and a federal prosecutor noted that the SBF trial could last about four weeks. The widely expected move came shortly after two of Bankman-Fried's associates, Gary Wang, FTX's former chief technology officer and co-founder, and Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Bankman-Fried's trading firm, pled guilty to fraud charges and agreed to cooperate with U.S. prosecutors to build a case against SBF. In her plea hearing on December 19, Ellison admitted that she conspired with others to use billions of dollars of customers' funds from Bankman-Fried's failed trading platform.

Read more: Solana Price Gains as Dog Coin Bonk Fires Up Community Interest  Sam Bankman-Fried, the now disgraced founder of bankrupt FTX, was a vocal supporter of Solana, and according to a Solana blog post in November, FTX and Alameda Research, an affiliated trading firm that Bankman-Fried also owned, purchased more than $58 million worth of SOL tokens from the foundation and its sister company Solana Labs six months after the platform first live with a test network.  That “initial attention” was helpful, Federa said, and it may have contributed to the network’s rise and now to its turmoil, as some Solana-based decentralized-finance (DeFi) projects leave the ecosystem.  Nonetheless, Federa said developers are continuing to join the network, even as non-fungible token (NFT) projects like DeGods and Y00ts leave. Federa pointed to NFT project Bonk (BONK), whose ""airdrop"" included a large portion of its tokens being sent to Solana users, sending SOL up 20% on Tuesday.  “You're not really seeing any projects migrate off of Solana that need the performance and power of the network,” Federa said. “There's a lot of stuff that you can only build on Solana, and those developers are continuing to build here.”  Read more: Solana’s Top NFT Projects DeGods and Y00ts to Migrate Chains",POSITIVE,SOL | BONK,EXCHANGE | SOL | TRADING | BONK | AIRDROP,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/03/solana-exec-says-platform-still-gaining-new-users-despite-ftxs-collapse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5a47230e9b4f981b74f23064778b4b03ac58cf4e-5760x3840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413271,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8F2I,1672772780,"Sam Bankman-Fried Pleads Not Guilty to Fraud, Conspiracy Charges","NEW YORK — Sam Bankman-Fried will go to trial in October.  U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York ruled on a tentative date for the anticipated weeks-long trial during the former FTX executive’s arraignment in the Manhattan courthouse on Tuesday afternoon. Bankman-Fried, who stands accused on eight different counts including wire fraud and campaign-finance violations, pleaded not guilty to all charges via his lawyer at the opening of the hearing.  The former CEO of the now-bankrupt crypto exchange made his second appearance in the federal courthouse on Tuesday. At his first appearance last week, Bankman-Fried was released on a personal recognizance bond, and shortly after that, he flew to his parents' home in California. His not guilty plea on Tuesday was expected, according to an earlier report in the Wall Street Journal.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon told the court that the prosecution expected the bulk of its discovery to be completed within the coming weeks. The government will produce materials it already has accessed within the next several weeks, she said. That includes documents shared by FTX’s bankruptcy attorneys.  Read more: Understanding the Charges Brought Against Sam Bankman-Fried  Kaplan also granted Bankman-Fried's application to seal the names of the two additional co-signers who, in addition to his parents, guaranteed his $250 million bail bond. Media organizations can object to the redaction of the identities of the bond signers through Jan. 12. Bankman-Fried's lawyers had argued that there were safety and privacy concerns with revealing the names of the co-signers.  On the government’s behalf, Sassoon asked the court to modify the conditions of Bankman-Fried's bail conditions, requesting that he be prohibited from accessing or transferring any assets tied to FTX or its affiliated entities. She referenced last week's discovery that several Alameda Research wallets had begun moving thousands of dollars' worth of crypto into other wallets.  ""This money is now inaccessible for the purposes of government seizure,"" Sassoon said.  Alameda Research was Bankman-Fried's trading firm.  While the defense argued that Bankman-Fried hadn't been involved in those transactions and in fact had been cooperating with the prosecution – which Sassoon acknowledged – the judge ruled that Bankman-Fried shouldn't be able to access or transfer any FTX- or Alameda-related funds.  Sassoon also said that while Bankman-Fried had tweeted that he wasn't involved in those transactions, he had “tweeted false statements” before.  Read more: Previewing FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s Not Guilty Plea in Court  Bankman-Fried was arrested last month in the Bahamas after a request from federal prosecutors, who unveiled eight different charges against him the next day.  Prosecutors alleged that Bankman-Fried “misappropriated” customer deposits, using client funds to pay for Alameda Research’s expenses and debts, and lied about FTX’s financial health in the process.  Tuesday's plea, which Bankman-Fried can change, at least for now sets up an October trial where prosecutors will spell out how they believe he violated federal laws in defrauding his customers, investors and lenders, as well as charges that he violated campaign-finance laws.  Before the trial, lawyers will have time to go through the voluminous discovery in the case. Bankman-Fried's lawyers have until April 3 to file a motion to dismiss the case, and federal prosecutors must respond by April 24. Bankman-Fried's subsequent reply is due on May 8, and both parties will get to argue their cases in a hearing on May 18 at 10 a.m. Eastern.

42421407,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXo3VF,1672771438,Bitcoin Mining: A Positive or Negative Indicator for the Future of Crypto?,"In a piece last week titled “Crypto will be fine,” former CoinDesker Brady Dale noted that even though crypto took a beating throughout 2022, some indicators remained bullish. Notably, Bitcoin’s hashrate, which is how much computational power is directed toward securing the network, held steadfast.  “If the industry were dying, these miners should be winding down. They aren't,” Dale wrote. Indeed, according to Blockchain.com data, Bitcoin’s hashrate hit an all-time high in November.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Bitcoin’s hashrate rose steadily over the past 12 months even as the network’s token, bitcoin (BTC), lost over two-thirds of its value. For many, that is a sign of faith in the long-term success of the network.  Of course, there’s more to the story than a single statistic. As Compass Mining’s Zack Voell (another ex-CoinDesker) detailed in a Monday report, the bitcoin mining industry took a series of beatings in 2022.  In his catalog of “all of the bad things that miners suffered,” Voell found that at least four executives of major mining firms resigned over the year, six lawsuits were filed against mining companies – for reasons stretching from breach of contract to zoning rule violations – and stocks for publicly traded mining companies were in the doldrums.  Additionally, two mining companies, Core Scientific (CORZ) and Compute North, filed for bankruptcy while Celsius Network and BlockFi, two bankrupt crypto lending firms with sizable mining wings, are likely going to have to restructure their operations. Another two mining companies, Marathon Digital (MARA) and Argo Blockchain (ARBK), are also at risk of filing for bankruptcy.  Read more: Inside Core Scientific’s Prearranged Bankruptcy  The situations vary by firm, but the main causes of the issue stem from bitcoin's depressed price and, often, poor treasury management. My colleague George Kaloudis simplified the picture by saying that over the last few years, many mining companies pursued accelerated growth strategies financed by debt and other investments while often choosing to hold onto their mined coins.  ""Many miners acted too deterministically,"" projecting bitcoin would hit $100,000, Juri Bulovic, head of mining at crypto mining and staking firm Foundry, which is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group, told CoinDesk’s Eliza Gkritsi. The situation worked well when bitcoin’s price was rising and the cost of financing expansion was cheap – two things thrown off course amid macroeconomic uncertainty and rising interest rates.  Already, outside firms have been stepping in to backstop losses and inject much-needed capital into the lagging professional mining sector. Galaxy Digital struck a $100 million deal with Argo, crypto exchange Binance has spun up a fund for distressed miners, and on Tuesday, investment giant BlackRock committed $17 million to bankrupt bitcoin miner Core Scientific.  Although the mining sector is in a precarious position – fueled in part by state-of-the-art mining equipment that was ordered and deployed during the heady days of 2021, when bitcoin hit a high of nearly $69,000 – the industry isn’t likely going to be wiped off the map. Battle-tested firms have better treasury management, and new financing options are coming online – like derivatives options from Two Prime that could allow miners to hedge their mining risks in a way that other commodities markets like oil do.  More capitulation and bankruptcies could come, and unprofitable miners may be taken offline. But considering the global sprawl of the mining industry, the sectors’ committed activist investors and supporters and the growing importance of mining within the hydrocarbon and wider energy sector, mining will remain. And the business might be better for its recent troubles.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/03/bitcoin-mining-a-positive-or-negative-indicator-for-the-future-of-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a946db2d8a9d07a547a7dd598539d68ea86eb2fb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421414,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXo3dV,1672768560,Previewing FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s Not Guilty Plea in Court,"Happy New Year everyone! Thanks for sticking around as this newsletter heads into year three. And as is befitting the first issue of 2023, we’re going to spend today in court for FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s arraignment.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  ‘Not guilty’  The narrative  GM. It's the third day of 2023, but to the U.S. federal court system it's the day of Sam Bankman-Fried's arraignment. For those of you in New York, it'll be at 500 Pearl St. in Manhattan at 2:00 p.m. ET.  Why it matters  Bankman-Fried was extradited and taken to court for a bail hearing in fairly short order last week, after just over a week in a Bahamian prison. U.S. authorities have already unveiled their charges against the former FTX CEO, and now we'll start seeing their actual case.  Breaking it down  To recap: Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested last month in the Bahamas at the behest of U.S. authorities, who later revealed they had indicted the FTX founder and former CEO on eight different charges: conspiracy to commit wire fraud on customers, wire fraud on customers, conspiracy to commit wire fraud on lenders, wire fraud on lenders, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and violate campaign finance laws.  Bankman-Fried is likely to plead “not guilty” to these charges this afternoon in a Manhattan courthouse, the Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported last week. After his extradition to the U.S., he appeared in court for his first bail hearing.  He’s currently out on a $250 million personal recognizance bond (not bail, which is important to note: neither he nor his family actually put $250 million in escrow or paid it to the court or even put up assets worth that much as collateral. Also SBF wants the names of the two co-signers to remain redacted).  CoinDesk will cover the arraignment, so keep an eye on the site for live updates.  Mark Cohen, the well-known attorney defending Bankman-Fried, and Christian Everdell, who works at Cohen’s firm Cohen & Gresser LLP, have both confirmed their appearances for the defense in court.  It's unclear, at least at the time of writing, whether any other motions or issues may be discussed. At any rate, today's hearing will set off the next steps in this long and increasingly complex process.  In bankruptcy news  In FTX's bankruptcy case, things are getting strained. Specifically, the U.S. management team and the Bahamas-appointed liquidators are escalating the ongoing jurisdictional mini feud.  Early last week, the Securities Commission of the Bahamas announced it had recovered and secured $3.5 billion worth of assets from FTX, a staggering and significant sum. That amount, coupled with the $1 billion the U.S. bankruptcy managers said they identified, would go a long way to helping the exchange's creditors become whole.  But, the U.S. bankruptcy team said the calculation was incorrect, and that the Bahamas had only recovered around $300 million worth of assets.  Obviously, that's a whole order of magnitude apart. The U.S. team said the value of the assets the Bahamas had recovered had fallen by the time the country announced their efforts.  Yesterday, the Bahamas disputed this characterization, saying the U.S. managers were wrong.  Without knowing what exactly these assets are, it's hard to say who's correct here. Still, this kind of fight seems unique, and it's clear the relationship between the managers in each country is continuing to deteriorate. The uncertainty also can’t be helping FTX’s creditors, who just want to know if they'll get their money back.  In non-FTX news  One of the big things we’re watching for this year is the U.S. Congress. During last year’s election, Republicans retook the House of Representatives with a slim margin, while Democrats retained the Senate. The split control of Congress was seen as a hopeful sign for the crypto industry, given its appearance as a bipartisan issue.  Before we get to the legislating though, the House needs to pick a new Speaker. And it’s a little unclear how this is going.  The Speaker of the House sets the legislative body’s agenda, ensures bills can come to the floor for a vote and otherwise has a lot of influence over what legislation lives and dies. The crypto industry should obviously pay attention as the individual who occupies this office will definitely impact which bills move forward.  Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), the former minority leader, was seen as a shoo-in for the speaker position now that his party is the majority.  However, the Republican majority is slim, and McCarthy doesn’t have much margin for winning the speakership. According to the Washington, D.C., press corps, he doesn’t currently have the votes to take up the gavel. One of the “no” votes, Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), confirmed in a statement he would not support McCarthy at this time. Other lawmakers are signaling hesitance as well.  This doesn’t mean McCarthy’s speakership bid is dead, just that it’s a lot more uncertain than people perhaps expected at this stage.  Meanwhile, Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), who is very vocally crypto-friendly, remains the Majority Whip, which means he’ll also help influence legislation this upcoming congressional term.

However, 2023 kicked off with a downtrend as the mining difficulty has begun to drop. A sharp drop in this metric recorded in the early hours of Tuesday could be the start of a trend reversal in this regard. Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Plunges The bitcoin mining difficulty declined suddenly on Tuesday morning during Asia hours. Data from CoinWarz shows that it had fallen almost 3.6% in a sharp downward correction. This took the mining difficulty from the 35.36T that it was trending at to 34.09T following the adjustment. Related Reading: Valkyrie Investments Wants To Take Over Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Reveals Plans The bitcoin mining difficulty is important in the fact that it actually measures how much power is needed to verify transaction blocks on the network. The higher this figure is, the more demand it shows for the bitcoin network. And the lower it becomes, it means there are fewer miners on the network. One factor that has had a profound effect on the mining difficulty in the last month was the blizzard that blew through the United States. As temperatures dropped dangerously low in some places, miners had to disconnect their machines to free up the energy grid. This was in a bid to leave enough energy for citizens to power their homes. BTC price at $16,700 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Impact Of This On BTC The bitcoin price is still stalling despite the sharp downward correction in the mining difficulty. The digital asset is still trending in the mid-$16,000s and has refused to budge. Even the return of some momentum with the new year has not been enough to trigger a movement beyond this point. So when looking at the broader picture with the difficulty adjustment and price, it does not look like there would be any profound effect on price. Also, miners are still seeing similar profitability in their mining operations, so there is no tipping of the scale toward sell-offs or holding.

Also, add in the fact that there are multiple events such as the DCG and Gemini debacle unfolding over the next month, and it becomes imperative for the cryptocurrency to hold support.

The transactions in a block get added at once to the chain, which is the complete history of legitimate transactions using bitcoin. Every blockchain has a genesis block, just as every regular chain has a final link. People care especially about the first Bitcoin block because Bitcoin was the first blockchain and remains the largest cryptocurrency in the world.  The number of transactions in a Bitcoin block is variable, but these days it’s generally between 1,000 and 2,500. On the other hand, the time blocks take to get validated or “mined” is consistently around 10 minutes. This schedule is built into the software: If blocks are mined too quickly, the validation hurdle contrived to keep the network secure and ensure the mining process is competitive automatically gets harder, and vice versa.  So, the Genesis Block contains the first set of bitcoin transactions to be validated. In fact, there was only one transaction, which was the distribution of the 50 BTC reward for mining the block to a certain address. Miners are still rewarded today, though the reward has since declined to 6.25 BTC. In the case of the Genesis Block, there was only one person who knew about bitcoin to mine it: the original cryptocurrency’s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.  Satoshi (almost certainly a pseudonym) mined the Genesis Block on Jan. 3, 2009. That was three months after he or she published the Bitcoin white paper in an online cryptography forum. People now call Jan. 3 “Genesis Block Day.”  The first Bitcoin block  Satoshi made the Genesis Block special in a number of ways. For one thing, the 50 BTC reward was sent to an address from which it can never be recovered. On a technical level, the 50 BTC transaction wasn't recorded as such in the same way as later transactions. That’s why any attempt to spend those coins would fail. Satoshi never commented on the reasons for that.  In a still more mysterious move, Satoshi wrote a message within the standard lines of data attached to the block. It was a headline from British newspaper The Times:  The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks  Again, Satoshi never explained this. But others have read heavily into the choice. One of Satoshi’s aims in creating Bitcoin might have been to save people from having to hand money over to a bank as an alternative to stashing cash under their mattress. In 2009, the great recession was in full swing. Some people had gone to their bank only to find their money was gone. Other people found their pensions had gone the same way. Many think it is no coincidence that Satoshi chose that particular headline to write into the Genesis Block. This was supposed to be the beginning of the end of people relying on banks so much that the government had to rescue them from their own mistakes using taxpayers’ money.  Whether Satoshi’s comment was targeted mainly at banks or governments or both remains a topic of debate among Bitcoin enthusiasts.  Another theory is a little more mundane. The inclusion of a headline from that day proved that the code wasn't written before that day. Satoshi might just have wanted to dispel any suggestion he had mined the block in advance to give himself some advantage as its creator.  Satoshi might have had all these things in mind. Barring a spectacular unmasking, we will never know for sure.  It is also peculiar that the second Bitcoin block was mined on Jan. 9, a whole six days after the first one. Remember, Bitcoin blocks are supposed to take 10 minutes to mine. There could be lots of reasons for the outlier block time. The algorithm that adjusts the difficulty of mining to maintain the 10 minutes only kicks in every two weeks or so. But the fun theory is that Satoshi was consciously echoing the six days that God takes to create the world in the Book of Genesis.  How are Bitcoin blocks different today?  Bitcoin blocks have changed a lot since 2009. They contain thousands of transactions, instead of one. They take 10 minutes to mine. As of January 2024, miners are rewarded with 6.25 BTC, after three “halvings” of the reward, which occur roughly every four years on a predetermined schedule. The next halving will likely take place in or around April 2024. Bitcoin blocks form an unbroken sequence, each specifically referencing the previous one, stretching all the way back to the Genesis Block.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/the-genesis-block,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e6a31b79e2ad31271547bf352f85b56831215833-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42413260,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8Es0,1672761772,Compass Mining Wins $1.5M in Lawsuit Against Hosting Firm,"Mining-services broker Compass Mining won $1.5 million in a lawsuit against hosting provider Dynamics Mining, court documents from last Thursday show.  Compass sued Dynamics last June for its failure to provide services and for withholding clients' machines. The broker had lent Dynamics $1 million to build two bitcoin mining sites, on top of paying $650,000 in hosting fees and deposits. Dynamics claimed that Compass failed to pay $861,000 in hosting and electricity charges and that Compass tried to break into Dynamics' mining facilities in order to steal the mining rigs.  Judge J. Travis Laster, of the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled in favor of Compass, entering in a default judgement against Dynamics for $1.5 million, as well as post-judgment interest and costs.  “We demand a high level of honesty and integrity from our hosting providers and will aggressively protect our clientele when their interests are threatened,” Compass co-CEO and co-founder Thomas Heller said in a blog post Friday.  In a tweet on Monday, Dynamics said it hopes ""that the US courts provides justice to the thousands of customers who have been displaced and lost their revenue.""  Compass, however, said it isn't sure whether it will be able to collect the $1.5 million.  ""Compass Mining’s efforts in this case will now turn to collecting its judgment against Dynamics, whose attorneys withdrew from the case for non-payment,"" it said in its blog post.  Compass has been trying to improve its reputation and relationship with customers after a series of what it called ""setbacks and disappointments"" that led to the resignation of then-CEO Whit Gibbs.

6972633,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514535,1672761651,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Lack Volumes To Justify Caps, Says Santiment","Data from Santiment reveals both Bitcoin and Ethereum currently lack the trading volumes to justify their market caps. Bitcoin And Ethereum NVT Ratios Are Both Bearish Right Now According to the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, both the bitcoin and ethereum networks will need to see a pickup in activity this year. The relevant indicator here is the “Network Value to Transaction” (NVT) ratio, which measures the ratio between the market cap of any crypto and its transaction activity. Usually, the trading volume is considered as the transaction activity of a coin, but Santiment’s NVT ratio works differently. Instead of dividing the market cap by the volumes, this version of the metric makes use of the “daily circulation,” a measure of the total number of unique coins that have seen some movement in the past day. The advantage of the circulation indicator is that transactions, where the same coins jump through several wallets, are only counted once towards the measurement, while the normal trading volume metric would have counted them as many times as they were transferred. This helps eliminate duplicate transactions and gives a more accurate idea about the market activity. Now, what the NVT ratio tells us is how the market cap of Bitcoin or Ethereum currently compares against the activity on the respective networks. High values of the metric suggest the volumes are much lower than the cap right now, and hence the coin may be overvalued at the moment. On the other hand, low values suggest the price may be undervalued. Related Reading: Litecoin Whale Withdraws $32M In LTC From Binance, Good Sign For Rally? Now, here is a chart that shows where the NVT ratio has been valuing Bitcoin and Ethereum during the past few years: The value of the metric seems to have been bearish for both the coins recently | Source: Santiment As the above graph shows, the NVT ratio has been bearish for Bitcoin since August 2022. This means that in the last few months, the circulation on the BTC network has remained pretty low when compared to the market cap of the crypto. For Ethereum, the indicator’s value had been switching between bearish and bullish throughout 2022, but the coin seems to have ended the year being overvalued as the circulation was bearish in December. Related Reading: Bitcoin Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Can’t Give Any Clear Signals As Demand Remains Low If the cryptos continue to be overvalued according to the NVT, then a correction may be imminent for them. “The circulation rate of both networks need to pick up in 2023, and this week will be telling as non-holiday days begin,” explains Santiment.

6969822,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514530,1672758047,Prediction: New Narrative Could See These Altcoins Skyrocket In 2023,"A look at the top performers over the past 24 hours reveals a trend that could trigger a boom among certain altcoins in 2023. We’re talking about Lido Finance (LDO), which has risen 7% in the past 24 hours and 17% over the past seven days, making it the 37th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Lido Finance is a decentralized liquid staking application that allows users to generate additional yield for staking their assets. The application currently offers support for five cryptocurrencies: Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), Kusama (KSM), and Polkadot (DOT). Of particular interest, however, is the first-mentioned altcoin, Ethereum. As Thor Hartvigsen, blockchain and defi researcher, explained, Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) altcoins could see a boom in 2023 as the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap implements the Shanghai upgrade. Of all major layer-1 blockchains, Ethereum has the lowest staking ratio of only 14%. In contrast, 90% of all BNB, 72% of all ADA, 68% of all SOL, and 62% of all AVAX are staked. The huge gap is likely related to the fact that ETH cannot yet be de-staked. However, the Shanghai hard fork planned for March will change that. Related Reading: These Altcoins Will Be Hit The Hardest If DCG And Grayscale Fall While the analyst expects a major unstaking initially, the upgrade could trigger massive growth for liquid staking solutions in the long run. And Lido Finance (LDO) is currently the undisputed leader in the liquid staking of ETH, providing further rocket fuel for the LDO token. Altcoins Poised To Skyrocket Based On The Narrative However, not only the LDO but rather small LSD altcoins could benefit from the new narrative. As anonymous analyst “Karl” says, numerous LSD solutions are poised to wobble at the throne of Lido Finance. Currently, LDO’s market share is about 65.62%, followed by Rocket Pool (3.10%), StakeWise (0.9%), Ankr (0.81%), Frax Finance (0.67%), and Stafi (0.25%). As the analyst assesses, the market caps of the altcoins Stakewise (SWISE) and Stafi (FIS) are still below $20 million, despite the fact that they control significant market share. “[T]heir tokenomics aren’t the best though, as there is still a considerable portion of the supply to be unlocked as team/investors’ allocation and liquidity mining rewards,” the analyst added. A look at the market share/market cap ratio also shows that both SWISE and FIS tokens are close behind the market leader, poised for future gains. Also remarkable is Frax Finance, which recently entered the LSD landscape of altcoins and has already managed to capture a significant market share. Hartvigsen stated that in less than 2 months, Frax has managed to attract more than 45,000 ETH (about $55 million TVL). According to the analyst, there are “no signs of slowing down” as APRs are consistently at 9-10%, far outperforming any competitor. Frax Finance accomplishes this by giving users frxETH when they are either liquidity pooled on Curve (frxETH/ETH) or staked on Frax Finance (sfrxETH). Related Reading: Craziest Bitcoin Price Predictions For 2023, 1,400% Rally Possible? “Only sfrxETH receives the ETH staking yield. This results in a higher APR as not all of the staked ETH is receiving the rewards as they are in the curve pool instead,” the analyst explained. But Rocket Pool is also a prime candidate to grow from the new narrative due to its relative size, recent popularity growth, and several differentiators, Hartvigsen added. Two Potential Spoilers For LDO However, in the near term, there could be two spoilers in particular for the price of the Lido Finance token, LDO. Both Nansen and Chain EDGE on-chain data shows that “smart money” has been selling LDO rather than buying it, Twitter user @AvaxGems pointed out. I guess not all of us are bullish on LSD coins. Both @nansen_ai and @ChainEDGE_io(by @OnChainWizard) showing ""smart money"" been selling $LDO rather than buying. pic.twitter.com/9k0nt0tHpG — rektGEMS🔺 (@AvaxGems) January 3, 2023 A second factor for LDO could be Alameda. The ex-company of Sam Bankman-Fried sold 719,498 LDO on December 28, worth about $717,451, for 601 ETH, and currently still has 1.86 million LDO left, the equivalent of about $1.81 million.

The lawyers were told the U.S. government takes no position on the request, according to the filing.  In the letter addressed to presiding judge Lewis R. Kaplan, attorneys Mark S. Cohen and Christian R. Everdell of Cohen & Gresser LLP said that their request is justified because ""all information relevant to the court's oversight of the bail proceedings"" – including the conditions for bail – will be public and that they are looking only to block the public disclosure of identities.  The lawyers also said Bankman-Fried's parents ""have received a steady stream of threatening correspondence, including communications expressing a desire that they suffer physical harm. Consequently, there is serious cause for concern that the two additional sureties would face similar intrusions on their privacy as well as threats and harassment if their names appear unredacted on their bonds or their identities are otherwise publicly disclosed.""  Following the stunning collapse of his multibillion-dollar crypto enterprise in November, Bankman-Fried was indicted by the Southern District of New York on charges that include money laundering and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The founder of now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX was arrested in the Bahamas and was extradited to the U.S. to face the charges in December.  Bankman-Fried's parents' house in California, as well as two additional sureties, secured the bail for his release following an appearance in the U.S. federal court in New York on Dec. 22. The means by which the bond for his bail was secured was heavily scrutinized in the days that followed his release.  Now, just ahead of his Tuesday arraignment hearing in New York, Bankman-Fried's lawyers are asking the identities of the two sureties ""be redacted on the bonds they will sign,"" and ""not be publicly disclosed by the government.""  ""In addition, the limited relief sought herein is narrowly tailored to protect interests that courts widely recognize as justifying an exception to the qualified right of public access, namely, the privacy and safety of the sureties,"" the letter motion said.

Litecoin Whale Takes Out $32M In LTC From Binance As per data from the crypto transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a massive LTC transfer has taken place during the past day.

Related Reading: Billion-Dollar Hedge Fund Is Betting Against Bitcoin And Grayscale, Not Just USDT Usually, such large transfers are a sign of activity from the whales, and due to the sheer scale of coins typically involved in them, the movements can sometimes have visible impacts on the price of Litecoin. However, which way the price will respond to a transfer depends on the intent behind it. Here are a few additional details regarding the latest whale transaction that may shed some light on its purpose: Looks like this massive transfer only took a negligible fee of 0.00000224 LTC to be possible | Source: Whale Alert As can be seen above, this Litecoin transaction was sent from a wallet attached to the crypto exchange Binance, and its destination was an unknown wallet. An unknown address is any address not affiliated with a known centralized platform and is thus likely to belong to a personal wallet. Related Reading: Bitcoin Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Can’t Give Any Clear Signals As Demand Remains Low Transfers of this nature, where coins move from exchanges to personal wallets, are called exchange outflows, and since holders usually withdraw from these platforms for accumulation purposes, outflows can have a bullish effect on the price. Here, the exchange outflow was done by a whale, so it may mean that this humongous investor is planning to hold onto their Litecoin for an extended period of time. In the few days since the new year has started, LTC has been rallying up with the coin already reclaiming $75, so the whale not selling here to take advantage of this profitable opportunity and instead opting to accumulate suggests conviction from the investor that there is more to come for LTC. There has also been another bullish signal for Litecoin recently, and it’s that the monthly LTC transactions on BitPay, the largest crypto payments processor, have gone up by 109% over the past year. This means that the network has observed some sharp growth in terms of adoption, a sign that should be constructive for the price in the long term.

Claimants allege that Genesis breached its master agreement when it became insolvent last summer, while hiding its insolvency from lenders like Gemini. Digital Currency Group, or DCG, owns CoinDesk.  The co-founder of Gemini has accused DCG CEO Barry Silbert of “bad faith stall tactics” as their companies lock horns over a business disagreement precipitated by crypto exchange FTX’s multibillion-dollar implosion late last year. Cameron Winklevoss blasted Silbert in an open letter posted to Twitter, alleging that crypto broker Genesis Global Capital and DCG owe Gemini’s clients $900 million. The letter alleges Gemini has awaited word on a repayment agreement for six weeks to no avail. In response, Silbert said his firm submitted a proposal to Genesis and Gemini’s advisers last Thursday.  The United Kingdom is enforcing a tax exemption for foreign investors purchasing crypto through local investment managers or brokers. The tax break, announced in December, is a part of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s plans to turn the U.K. into a crypto hub. “This exemption is an important factor in attracting global investors, meaning foreign investors won’t be brought into U.K. tax simply by appointing U.K.-based investment managers,” the government's tax arm, the HM Revenue and Customs, said in an email to CoinDesk.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the dollar index's (DXY) performance in January going back to 2000.  The DXY has appreciated 14 out of 22 times in January.  The bullish seasonality means the battered greenback could rebound this month, adding to the crypto market's woes.  The DXY declined by 7.7% in the final quarter of 2022. Yet, bitcoin fell nearly 15%, thanks predominantly to FTX contagion fears.

42413259,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8Ets,1672752450,Bahamas-FTX Dispute Heats Up as Bankman-Fried Prepares for Trial,"A media and legal dispute between FTX’s new U.S. owners and regulators in the Bahamas has worsened as the two prepare to take their case to a full court hearing later this week.  Each side is seeking to associate the other to the alleged underhand dealings of the crypto exchange's former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, who is awaiting trial for fraud in the U.S. after being extradited from the Bahamas and released on bail.  Central to the dispute is who can have access to FTX’s internal systems, such as internal Slack messages and the QuickBooks accounting software. Bahamas liquidator Brian Simms says he needs the data to wind up his side of the company, as a local court ordered him to do in November. New FTX chief John Ray III says the request has “staggering overbreadth.”  As Bankman-Fried prepares for his arraignment in New York, a Delaware bankruptcy court will have to adjudicate in a jurisdictional dispute between the two parties that have publicly accused each other of being “reckless in the extreme” and having a “cavalier attitude toward the truth.”  In late December, the Bahamian government hired law firm Brown Rudnick LLP – famous for representing actor Johnny Depp in his defamation lawsuit against ex-wife Amber Heard – to handle communications with media outlets and government agencies in the U.S., Bloomberg Law reported Tuesday.  In one corner stand liquidators who argue the company was in practice run from the Bahamas; in the other, Ray, who says the Bahamas entity of the company is at best a sideshow.  FTX Digital Markets was “never the center of the FTX group” and is “a virtual nullity” within Bankman-Fried’s empire – merely a short-lived matchmaking service that operated for just six months and earned no third-party revenue, Ray’s legal team argued in a legal deposition posted Friday.  FTX says that any information shared with counterparts in the Bahamas would be abused, and that the Bahamian government and liquidators “colluded” with FTX founders Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang, who, in Ray’s words, left the company “more closely resembling a crime scene than an operating business.”  Simms and the Bahamas Securities Commission “worked with Mr. Bankman-Fried, under criminal indictment for one of the largest financial crimes in history … to take digital assets” from FTX’s cloud service on Nov. 11-12, only seeking court approval after the fact, Friday’s the filing from FTX's new management said, accusing Bahamas liquidators of malpractice.  “It is also possible that after his appointment Mr. Simms violated his fiduciary duties as provisional liquidator by allowing the withdrawal window to remain open for Bahamas residents,” the filing said, referring to a one-day window in which $100 million in FTX assets were withdrawn, and by transferring funds to the Commission.  Ray also appears to disbelieve a claim by Bahamian authorities that they hold $3.5 billion in FTX assets, describing the valuation as “reckless in the extreme.”  Either the Bahamians have further assets they haven’t disclosed or the tokens they do hold – mainly 195 million shares of FTX’s own FTT token – are now worth closer to $167 million given the collapse in value, the FTX filing said.  The Dec. 30 filing received a furious rejoinder from the Bahamas Securities Commission, which on Monday issued a press release saying it “must once again correct material misstatements” made by Ray.  A claim that Bahamian authorities had instructed the minting of new tokens after bankruptcy was declared are “unfounded” and “without evidence,” the Commission said.  Court filings supplied by FTX include a Nov. 13 Slack message by Wang that said a transfer of FTT was directed by Bahamas regulators and a Nov. 12 letter from the Commission’s executive director, Christina Rolle, to Tether instructing the company to simultaneously burn and mint USDT coins.  FTX’s claims regarding asset valuation are “based on incomplete information,” the Commission’s press statement added.  Ray’s “continued lack of diligence … reflects a cavalier attitude towards the truth,” it said – adding that FTX’s current senior managers, including Ray, were appointed by Bankman-Fried. Asked by CoinDesk, the Commission didn't offer any further explanation of how it arrived at the $3.5 billion figure.  A substantive hearing on the issue is due to begin Friday. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey will preside.

The deal is the bitcoin miner's latest effort to improve its balance sheet. In August, Stronghold announced a deal to return 26,200 mining rigs to lender NYDIG in exchange for extinguishing $67.4 million in debt. In September, the company cancelled a hosting agreement with Germany's Northern Data in an effort to improve its cash flow.  Under the agreement announced on Tuesday, 10% convertible notes will be extinguished in exchange for a new series of convertible preferred shares that can be converted into common shares for 40 cents per share.  If all the preferred stock is converted, about 57.8 million common shares would be issued, adding about 46% to the current common float, according to the company. Stronghold won't pay a dividend on the new preferred shares.  With the deal, which is set to close by Feb. 20, Stronghold will have less than $55 million in debt outstanding, CEO Greg Beard said in the statement.  At the end of 2022, Stronghold had about $12.4 million of unrestricted cash and about 6 bitcoins, which are worth about $100,000 at current prices.

42413273,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8F3E,1672750800,"Heatbit Is the First Space Heater That Mines Bitcoin, Founder Says","‘Tis the season to be freezing, but in the cold, dark winter, Heatbit says its innovative space heaters can warm a room the size of a small studio apartment while mining enough bitcoin to offset at least a portion of a homeowner's monthly electric bill.  The two-year-old startup introduced its sleek, multi-colored heaters – about the size of an extra large PC computer tower – earlier this year. So far, it has sold nearly 1,000 units globally, but it has been encouraged enough to begin planning a wider roll-out.  “Is it a gold mine? Does it make a lot of money quickly? No, definitely not,” said Alex Busarov, co-founder of Heatbit, during a CoinDesk interview. “Is it something that's going to be quietly mining some [satoshis] for you? Well yeah, at some point it's gonna pay off.”  Heatbit looks like other high-end heaters. But integrated circuits inside the device quietly process bitcoin transactions and perform trillions of calculations per second. That activity not only generates bitcoin rewards (courtesy of bitcoin mining pool Nicehash), but also heat.  That heat, according to the official Heatbit site, is enough to warm 500 square feet of space. The kicker is, if you run the heater 24 hours a day at a bitcoin price of $20,000, the device will put $30 back into your pocket every month to help cover your electricity bill. Given the jump in energy costs last year, that capability may offer consumers some incentive.  Read more: Europe’s Last Bitcoin Mining Refuge Is No Longer Viable  Heatbit isn’t cheap. Despite the low noise, cool aesthetics and Wi-Fi compatibility, the $1,200 price tag still elicits sticker shock – even from crypto insiders.  But Busarov is quick to defend his invention by pointing to other high-end heaters at similar prices that don’t mine bitcoin.  “I think it's comparable to something like a $700 Dyson heater. And frankly, other heaters don't pay for themselves,” Busarov explains.  Heatbit isn’t the first mining heater. Four years ago, Qarnot, a French startup, rolled out QC1 – a “crypto heater” optimized for mining ether. The device cost $3,600, but it's unclear if it was ever commercialized.  More recently, Coinmine, the company behind Coinmine One – an at-home crypto miner that also focused on cryptocurrencies such as ether, but was not a heater – discontinued operations right after the Merge (customer tweets seem to imply Ethereum’s switch to proof-of-stake was the deciding factor).  Read more: The $799 Coinmine One Will Look Like an Xbox and Mint Crypto Money  Busarov doesn’t seem fazed by these historical busts.  “We have a pretty good margin right now. We were very lean with our costs. We could just keep selling the same device,” Busarov said. “But that's not the path of growth. We want to make a bit of a revolution.”  Busarov is planning to raise capital to build other product lines. He toyed with the idea of manufacturing heated toilet seats that also mine bitcoin, but has since settled on developing a fanless Heatbit version. Busarov also envisions the company building its own computer chips. Further in the future, the company may even venture into all-season products.  “There is water heating – water for washing dishes or taking a shower, Busarov said. “That's the one [product] that people use all year round.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MINING | TRADING,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/03/heatbit-space-heater-will-also-mine-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/884d9e4ff99364e9daaf1ee72cabbbbf3eace74d-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bankman-Fried was released after he and his parents signed a $250M bail package in December. The bond is secured by his parents' home in Palo Alto, California, but it's unlikely the home is valued anywhere near $250M. Often, ultra-large bonds are backed by assets worth only ~10% of the stated amount, Bloomberg said. The judge had asked that the bond be signed by two other people of ""considerable means."" Only one of those people can be a relative. The two people haven't yet signed the papers, but plan to do so by the Jan. 5 deadline, according to the letter from his lawyers. Last month, two of Bankman-Fried's associates, Gary Wang, FTX's former chief technology officer and co-founder, and Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Bankman-Fried's trading firm, pled guilty to fraud charges and agreed to cooperate with U.S. prosecutors.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3921486-ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-expected-to-plead-not-guilty-in-manhattan-court-report?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/6963086.jpeg
42413253,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8EnK,1672749492,Bernstein Says Crypto Exchange Binance Not Likely to Fail,"Binance is solvent, liquid and stable, which is evident in the exchange’s more than $55 billion in verifiable cold wallet addresses, Bernstein said in a research report Monday.  The crypto exchange can also “pass the test of withdrawals” as it did when $6 billion of customer funds were withdrawn on Dec. 13, the report said.  “Binance’s undisputed market leadership has not been an accident – it has a long history of doing right by the customer,” the report added, noting that the exchange has made customers whole through hacks and regulatory challenges. The exchange now accounts for about 75% of the global crypto trading market.  Bernstein says Binance faces two challenges. First, it has an offshore holding company based out of the Cayman Islands, which means it must take “progressive steps moving towards an on-shore structure,” even at the cost of short-term business.  Second, following the demise of crypto exchange FTX, it is now a “virtual monopoly in global crypto trading.” While it can't do much about its monopolistic position, competition may now emerge from decentralized exchanges, as traders could diversify their activities toward self-custody and decentralized trading platforms.  Binance will continue to seek licenses across multiple jurisdictions. It has obtained licenses from 14 countries so far, including France, Italy, Spain and Canada, the note added.

42413257,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8Er4,1672747957,Solana's SOL Token Surges 20% as Dog Coin Bonk Fires Up Community Interest,"Solana's SOL has surged about 20% in the past 24 hours even as larger cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) barely moved, as a decision by newly launched shiba inu-themed token Bonk (BONK) to do a large airdrop generated interest in the Solana community.  SOL leapt back above $13 on Tuesday following nearly nine straight days of losses that saw them trade at just over $8 on Friday. Selling pressure had resulted from Solana's close links to Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of crypto exchange FTX, who faces charges of fraud and misappropriation of client funds.  The recent price surge has liquidated some $6.7 million of short positions, according to Coinglass. This is the largest short liquidation since the collapse of FTX exchange and the subsequent market crash in November. Funding rates for SOL perpetual swaps are deeply negative, per Coinglass data, suggesting traders are bearish and betting for the token's price to drop, also known as shorting.  The Bonk airdrop – amounting to 50% of its token supply – likely drove massive community interest. Some 20% of the total airdrop supply is going to Solana NFT collections – comprising 297,000 individual NFTs – and 10% to Solana-focused artists and collectors. Airdrops refer to an unsolicited distribution of a cryptocurrency token or coin, usually for free, to numerous wallet addresses and are generally used as a tactic to gain users.  Bonk saw over $19 million in on-chain volumes in the past 24 hours alone. As of Tuesday, since its Dec. 25 issuance, Bonk has over 85,000 holders and a market capitalization of nearly $93 million. Users have conducted over 500,000 transactions using bonk tokens in the past week, data shows.  Several Solana projects have already integrated bonk tokens for use as payments for listed NFTs, while some introduced “burn” mechanisms for NFT-based events. Token burning means removing coins from the overall supply of a cryptocurrency.  Bonk prices rose some 95% in the past 24 hours. Major memecoins such as shiba inu (SHIB) and dogecoin (DOGE) were unchanged.  Memecoins are known to attract irrational exuberance from the crypto community, with the market capitalization of SHIB and DOGE reaching over $30 billion each in early 2022.

The Winklevoss twins have given DCG an ultimatum of January 8th to return the $900 million Gemini Earn customer funds, while the users themselves have filed a class action lawsuit against both companies. In addition, in what is believed to be a tactical decision, Valkyrie Investments and Fir Tree recently got involved in the “Shakespearean drama,” as NewsBTC reported yesterday. Thus, the pressure on DCG CEO Barry Silbert is building up day by day, while he is presumably hoping for Feb. 3rd when a three-judge panel will rule on the complaint against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for refusing to convert GBTC into a Bitcoin spot ETF. These Altcoins Are The Biggest Holdings Of DCG And Grayscale As many know, Grayscale owns a massive amount of Bitcoin as part of its GBTC, namely more than 630,000 BTC, which is causing great concerns among investors. However, as a Twitter user, Karl shows, not only BTC investors but also altcoin investors should be rooting for Silbert’s companies to survive. Related Reading: Craziest Bitcoin Price Predictions For 2023, 1,400% Rally Possible? While the more than 630,000 BTC “only” represent 3.28% of all Bitcoins in circulation, there are two altcoins owned by the company that represents an even higher percentage of the total market cap. Within its other trusts, Grayscale holds a staggering 8.53% of all Ethereum Classic (ETC), the equivalent of around $189 million. Second, on the list is Horizen (ZEN). The share of the total market capital is 4.64%, around $5.7 million. But Grayscale also has an immensely high share of ZCash (ZEC) and Ethereum (ETH) with 2.53% and 2.52%, respectively. They are followed by Litecoin (2.11%), Bitcoin Cash (1.6%), and MANA (1%). if Grayscale is forced to sell their balance sheet to cover Genesis' creditors, these tokens would be the most impacted pic.twitter.com/13Lo0yYPl9 — Karl (@karl_0x) January 2, 2023 The main concern for the above cryptocurrency investors could be that the company led by Micheal Sonnenshein is liquidating some of its altcoin trusts to save its flagship product the GBTC and possibly Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and the entire Digital Currency Group. Silbert could use the funds to serve creditors. Given the massive stakes in the overall market, it would be almost impossible to rule out the possibility of the already underperforming altcoins suffering even higher, hefty losses due to a Grayscale dump. The Ethereum Classic price is currently 90.85% below its all-time high of $176.16, while Horizen is trading 94.44% below its all-time high of $168.15. The biggest loss comes from Zcash, which is 99.36% below the all-time high of $5,941.80. Hurdles For Grayscale For Dissolving Their Trusts Whether there will be a dissolution of all or only some of the trusts can only be speculated at this time. CEO Michael Sonnenshein had emphasized several times in recent weeks that Grayscale has no intention of dissolving the GBTC fund. Despite that, he brought into play the option of returning up to 20% of GBTC’s capital to shareholders if he fails to convert the product into an exchange-traded fund two weeks ago. Related Reading: Valkyrie Investments Wants To Take Over Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Reveals Plans Still, there are high legal hurdles. It’s important to remember that Grayscale is regulated by the SEC. Dissolving trusts requires an application to the SEC, and the process is very lengthy and difficult, on the other hand not impossible as evidenced by the dissolution of the XRP trust as a result of the SEC lawsuit against Ripple. Grayscale has a low-risk, high-return project. However, the current developments put massive pressure on DCG and therefore also on Grayscale. Due to the connections through loans between both companies, a downfall of the parent company could also drag the cash cow Grayscale down with it. However, it is important to emphasize that a downfall does not necessarily mean a dump of all coins at once. If there is a Reg M solution, probably not all Grayscale investors would want to sell. It, therefore, remains important for investors to monitor the development of the DCG/ Grayscale drama. At press time, the Ethereum price stood at $1,216, still lagging momentum.

However, it seems as though 2023 has new plans for the struggling ecosystem with its native token SOL up by 13% based on CoinGecko figures, Tuesday. This huge uptick in price led to SOL reclaiming double digits after dipping as long as $7.96 back in December 29. Related Reading: SushiSwap Head Chef Suggests Cooking Up New Token Model – Will The DEX Survive 2023? A Breath Of Fresh Air For Solana After the ecosystem lost most of its value last year, this price pump is a breath of fresh air for investors and holders of SOL. Even though the bears left their mark on investor sentiment on SOL, some are still bullish for a possible reversal. This, however, is not surprising. Solana has been taking its time in distancing itself from being known as one of the “Sam coins”, with Messari releasing a detailed overview about the ecosystem on December 15. Solana’s token isn’t the only one that was hit hard, however. Solana’s NFT market has suffered through this whole debacle as DeGods and y00ts, two of the most prominent collections on-chain, decided to migrate to Polygon. Solana NFTs sure don’t look dead pic.twitter.com/UXNqJ6wRyi — Mamba 🐍 (@Mamba248x) December 31, 2022 However, this has not stopped Solana from still maintaining its top 2 spot in terms of NFT sales volume. Transactions also support a bullish future for its native token as it still retains its top 1 spot in transaction volume according to Delphi Digital, an institutional grade research platform. With Solana leading in active addresses against competitors as well, we can definitely see why the SOL has just shot straight up. Macro And FUD, Not A Great Mix Even though the current bullishness is good news, investors and traders shouldn’t disregard the power of macroeconomics on crypto markets. With SOL still being highly correlated with Bitcoin, we can see SOL’s price move somewhat closely tied to BTC’s price movement.

Not to mention that the U.S. Federal Reserve does plan to increase its interest rate if inflation does not slow down in the coming months. This will cause a slow down for SOL’s recovery in the coming months if the situation does not improve.

42413272,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8EyY,1672744018,Bernstein: Returns From Buying Crypto During Downturns Have Been Spectacular,"Before the turmoil of 2022, the digital-assets market had witnessed two crypto winters, and the returns from buying into such periods of market stress have been spectacular, brokerage firm Bernstein said in a research report Monday.  Bernstein notes that despite bitcoin’s (BTC) slump last year, the largest cryptocurrency is up about 60 times from its 2014 low and roughly five times from its 2018 bottom. Ether (ETH) is up 14 times from its 2018 lows, despite a 68% slide last year.  The crypto industry has a strong track record of fighting back from its lows and “taking punches when down,” the report said. Still, some may argue that the macro backdrop is different this time, the report added.  “Crypto is probably among the few industries that can clock frontier-tech-like growth, in a broadly maturing tech landscape,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote. Crypto touches less than 5% of total internet users with “significant headroom for application led adoption.”  Investors should continue to focus on the long-term consumer adoption of crypto, the note said, and that adoption should mirror the growth of the internet, as blockchain applications become more mainstream.  As blockchains scale up and applications mature, Bernstein expects the monthly user base to increase by as much as 100-fold long term, with gaming, social and non-fungible-token (NFT)-based digital commerce and brands leading adoption.  NFTs are digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items and that can be sold or traded.  The crypto industry should focus on growing by “accepting a few regulatory trade-offs, that would incite more capital and mainstream participation,” the note added.

42388280,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRCVzh,1672742917,"Ethereum's Upcoming Shanghai Upgrade Powers Lido DAO, SWISE, RPL Tokens Higher","There is rarely a dull moment in the crypto market.  While bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) remain in stasis, governance tokens of liquid staking platforms, which allow users to retain liquidity of their tokens even though they are locked in a blockchain network, are rallying.  Lido DAO or LDO, the governance token of the Lido decentralized autonomous organization, has jumped 19% in the past seven days, with prices reaching a one-and-a-half-month high of $1.30 early Tuesday, according to data source CoinGecko. Liquid staking protocol StakeWise's SWISE token has surged over 70% in a week, while Rocket Pool's RPL has gained almost 10%.  The rally follows Ethereum developers' Dec. 8 announcement that the network's next hard fork, or backward-incompatible software upgrade, will take place in March. The upgrade, known as Shanghai, will include code allowing withdrawals of ether staked in the Beacon Chain since December 2020, finally giving participants a timeline for reclaiming their ether.  ""Most recently, liquid staking derivatives [tokens] have had a nice uptrend. This is thanks to the Shanghai upgrade expected in a few months, which will enable withdrawals of staked ETH,"" pseudonymous analyst CroissantEth tweeted. ""As withdrawals are enabled, many believe more users will stake their ETH.""  Staking refers to locking coins in a cryptocurrency wallet to support a blockchain's operations in return for rewards. The process is loosely analogous to investing in fixed-income securities, such as bonds.  Staking, however, can tie up assets for a long time. Liquid staking protocols remove the opportunity cost by issuing a derivative token that represents the claim on the locked coins and rewards earned. These derivative tokens can be used elsewhere to generate additional yield.  At press time, ether staked through liquid staking protocols accounted for over 40% of the total ether deposits of more than 15.7 million, according to data sourced from Dune Analytics. That explains liquid staking governance tokens' positive price action ahead of the Shanghai upgrade.  According to Messari, ether has a staking ratio of 14%, the lowest among layer 1 coins. Therefore, there is plenty of room for growth in the ether stake rate – the amount of ether staked relative to the cryptocurrency's total supply – and adoption of liquid staking protocols.  Activity in liquid staking protocols has picked up in the past few weeks, as highlighted by David Alexander of Binance Labs, the venture-capital arm of crypto exchange Binance.  With a total value locked at $5.9 billion, Lido has left behind MakerDAO and AAVE to become the world's biggest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, according to data source DefiLlama.  Shorts stacked in LDO  Still, some traders appear to be skeptical of long-lasting gains in LDO. That's evident from the profoundly negative funding rates or costs incurred for holding bullish long or bearish short positions in the perpetual futures contracts tied to LDO.  A negative funding rate indicates the leverage is skewed on the bearish side. That leaves the doors open for a short squeeze, which is an exaggerated price rally triggered by bears squaring off their positions.  ""Shorts have stacked on (in LDO) following the outperformance in hopes that early investors sell (according to on-chain evidence),"" crypto hedge fund Ouroboros Capital told CoinDesk. ""However, it is likely as well that shorts can be squeezed, ushering another leg up as these on-chain sellers were merely closing their perp shorts/spot longs.""",POSITIVE,ETH | LDO | RPL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | LDO | RPL,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/03/ethereums-impending-shanghai-upgrade-powers-lido-dao-swise-rpl-tokens-higher,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2af90e3515f41994c95d700445805411e685a0ae-2671x939.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Chief Technology Officer Matthew Lilley said in a tweet thread last week that two products – the Kashi lending platform and MISO, a launchpad for external tokens – would be shuttered because of low public interest and the significant effort that went into maintaining the two.  “We made the decision to deprecate Kashi (Sushi Lending) and Miso (Sushi Launch Pad),” Lilley said, adding that yet-unnamed “successors” to these products could be released in the future once Sushi has the requisite resources to support their functioning.  Lilley said Sushi developers would focus more on the protocol’s decentralized-exchange (DEX) product. “In Q3/Q4 it became obvious that there was a strong need to prioritize, and we decided to focus on ideas to improve our most-loved and profitable product, the DEX, SushiSwap,” he said.  SushiSwap, the DEX, had over $390 million in locked token value as of Tuesday, according to DefiLlama data. Some $280 million of that is locked on Ethereum-based assets.  In contrast, Kashi has a little over $800,000 in locked assets, the data shows, suggesting poor demand for the lending product. It held nearly $40 million during its 2021 peak, but has seen gradual outflows ever since.  Last year proved to be a difficult one for crypto lenders, with centralized companies like Celsius Network and Voyager Digital filing for bankruptcy after yields on DeFi platforms dried up.  Since December, Sushi developers have been proposing and making changes to the protocol to ensure its long-term viability.  As CoinDesk reported, the Sushi treasury provided for only 18 months of runway calculated from the first week of December, causing a significant deficit in its treasury. Lead developer Jared Gray proposed setting Kanpai, a fee-diversion protocol, to 100% of fees diverted to the treasury multisig for one year at the time, or until new token distribution and reward schemes were implemented.  On Dec. 30, Gray proposed a token buyback, fee burns and rewards plan to the Sushi community.

In December $62 million worth of tokens were stolen, scammed or attacked, making it the least harmful month in 2022 in terms of money lost to nefarious activities. In contrast, CertiK recorded over $595 million worth of crypto-based attacks in November.  The year, overall, saw over $3.7 billion lost to various attacks, hacks and scams – making 2022 the worst year in the market’s history so far. Attackers gained over $3.2 billion in 2021. But 2022 was off to an even rockier start with a $325 million exploit of popular cross-chain service Wormhole, which was followed by a $625 million attack on Axie Infinity’s Ronin bridge, and then a $200 million exploit of the Nomad bridge.  Helio Protocol’s $15 million attack and Defrost Finance’s $12 million alleged rug pull were the top attacks in December. A rug pull refers to a developer or creator promoting a project, such as a new token or non-fungible token release, and then disappearing with investor money.  Flash loan attacks saw over $7.6 million impacted, with a single attack on crypto project Lodestar accounting for $6.5 million of this figure. Four other projects saw similar attacks with amounts ranging from $50,000 to $300,000.  Flash loans are a popular way for attackers to gain funds to conduct exploits on decentralized finance (DeFi) systems.  The loans allow traders to borrow unsecured funds from lenders using smart contracts instead of third parties. They do not require any collateral because the contract considers the transaction complete only when the borrower repays the lender. This means a borrower defaulting on a flash loan would cause the smart contract to cancel the transaction and the money would be returned to the lender.  Attack vectors in the crypto sector range from exploiting bridges, a blockchain-based tool that allows users to transact between different networks, to market manipulation, where rogue traders utilize millions of dollars to move thinly traded markets in their favor to net several multiples of the initial capital deployed.",NEUTRAL,없음,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/03/2022-crypto-attacks-were-least-in-december-with-62m-lost-in-heists-certik-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b035bcebbf5348a357c34d15ba57387738402ebc-3353x2514.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This 100% allocation, however, is temporary until the DEX’s situation improves or new tokenomics are enacted. Will this proposal be the answer to SushiSwap’s urgent situation? Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash Closes 2022 With A Year-Low – Will 2023 Be Better? New Year, New Tokenomics Grey’s current proposal, if passed, is a technical undertaking for the DEX which could save it from its current state. According to the proposal, liquidity providers, or LPs, will receive a share of the 0.05 % swap fee on the ecosystem. Chart: Sushi Tokenomics Proposal PDF They can also lock their liquidity to earn emission-based rewards with a soft-lock system, meaning that they can pull their liquidity out before it reaches maturity but they lose their rewards. xSUSHI rewards are also updated. The token would lose its previous cut on the fees and will be replaced with an emission-based rewards system. The soft-lock system will have differing rewards for different lock tiers. The emission APY, according to the forum post, will be around 1-3% if instated. The new tokenomics would also introduce token burning in the form of buy backs of SUSHI and burning off the rewards if the locked liquidity or xSUSHI is pulled out.

This is incredibly troubling as this only leaves the team a measly $1 million for making SushiSwap better through innovation. Jared Grey’s reply to this is just: “Yes, we need to pay people competitive wages to work at Sushi.” SUSHI total market cap at $217 million on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com But it seems that the proposed tokenomics has an effect on SUSHI’s price. According to CoinGecko, SUSHI has jumped by 1.8% in the past 24 hours with the biggest rally in the weekly timeframe at 2.8%. The DEX’s fundamentals are also looking bullish as Cryptolaxy, a crypto fundamental and technical analysis platform, show that SUSHI is undervalued to some degree. If SUSHI is to recover from 2022 market woes, the token must break through $0.9849 resistance. As the year progresses forward, we’ll see if SushiSwap will implement its proposed tokenomics and save it from its current state. -Restaurant Business Magazine",NEUTRAL,SUSHI,BCH | ICO | MARKET | SUSHI | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/news/sushiswap-new-token-model/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk.  Class-action arbitration — a dispute resolution process where a neutral third-party arbitrator resolves disputes between parties — is often seen as an alternative to a class-action lawsuit. The arbitration process is usually voluntary and less formal. However, the decision of the arbitrator is binding and cannot be appealed, making the process potentially faster and less expensive than a class-action lawsuit.  The claimants allege Genesis has failed to return their and all Gemini Earn users' digital assets as required under the Master Agreements between the firm and users.  They claim Genesis first breached the Master Agreement when the firm became insolvent in the summer of 2022, but concealed its insolvency from its customers.  Genesis then, they allege, engaged in a sham transaction with its parent company, DCG, to conceal the insolvency, exchanging the right to collect a $2.3 billion debt owed to Genesis by the now-insolvent hedge fund Three Arrows Capital for a promissory note of $1.1 billion due in 2033.  The group also claims that Genesis’ Master Agreement effectively is creating unregistered sales of securities, and are seeking to rescind the contracts of sale and related damages.  There is also a concurrent class-action suit filed against Gemini in late December by investors Brendan Picha and Max J. Hastings, which alleges the exchange engaged in the sale of unregistered securities via its Earn program.  ""When Genesis encountered financial distress as a result of a series of collapses in the crypto market in 2022, including FTX Trading Ltd. (“FTX”), Genesis was unable to return the crypto assets it borrowed from Gemini Earn investors,"" a filing from the Pica and Hastings class action says. ""[Gemini] refused to honor any further investor redemptions, effectively wiping out all investors who still had holdings in the program, including plaintiffs.""  Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss and DCG CEO Barry Silbert engaged in a back-and-forth on Twitter late Monday, where the exchange executive accused Silbert of engaging in “bad faith stall tactics” over plans to resume withdrawals from Genesis.

Experts are debating whether bulls or bears will drive 2023’s price action. Last year, bears took over and sent the benchmark crypto back to its 2020 levels. Related Reading: Cardano Enters 2023 With A Bang, But ADA Still Bearish In The Short Term As of this writing, the Bitcoin price trades at $16,700, recording a small profit during today’s trading session. On higher timeframes, the cryptocurrency continues to record sideways price action. The latter could operate as the dominant price action for 2023. The Best Is Yet To Come For The Bitcoin Price Per a report from CNBC, the Bitcoin price is bound for an extreme shift in its trajectory. Optimistic experts, such as BTC bull Tim Draper, believe the cryptocurrency will trend higher from its current levels. Draper believes the benchmark crypto will experience a 1,400% rally, reclaim previously lost territory, and break above $250,000 by mid-2023. The BTC bulls believe macroeconomic conditions will push adoption much higher. One demographic will lead this potential new wave of adoption that will coincide with the upcoming Bitcoin halving. This event is scheduled for 2024, but in the past, the market has priced its impact much earlier. Draper said: My assumption is that since women control 80% of retail spending, and only 1 in 7 bitcoin wallets are currently held by women that the dam is about to break. Professor of finance at Sussex University, Carol Alexander, believes Bitcoin could see two short-term rallies. The first could take the Bitcoin price back to $30,000, and the second to $50,000 on the back of less trading volume and prominent players. As FTX and Three Arrows Capital collapse, Alexander expects less competition in the market, which could provide other prominent players with room to push BTC upwards. The professor explained: There will be a managed bull market in 2023, not a bubble — so we won’t see the price overshooting as before. We’ll see a month or two of stable trending prices interspersed with range-bounded periods and probably a couple of short-lived crashes. Exploring Less Favorable Scenarios, How Low Can BTC Go? Better macroeconomic landscape, adoption, halving and supply squeeze, and less competition. These are the factors that could work in favor of the cryptocurrency. On the other hand, Eric Robertsen from Standard Charted claims the Bitcoin price could return to its 2020 levels and touch $5,000. A lack of trust from investors and more capitulation from crypto companies could prompt this scenario. The low liquidity levels in the sector make things worse. The current state of the market could experience another leg lower if the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) doubles down on its hawkish monetary policy.
