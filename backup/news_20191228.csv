42383104,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uAK9,1577534431,Data Creators Should Share in the Profits From Big Data,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Alex McDougall in the co-founder Bicameral Ventures, a venture capital firm focused on blockchain, interoperability, data and identity self-sovereignty, personalized AI, and Web 3.0.      Striking it rich. The phrase derives from natural resources exploitation. Prospectors would strike an easy patch of oil, extract it from the ground, sell it and get rich. Sometimes it was hyper-focused geological engineering that made the strike, sometimes the speculator stumbled upon it in a TV hillbilly swamp. But the story remains the same: someone finds a resource, accesses it, and sells it.      We’ve had a checkered history with resources compensation dating back to the colonial era, but in the modern capitalist era we’ve been relatively good about acknowledging who owns the land oil is found on and assigning some level of compensation to them for the use of “their” resource. Not so with personal data. ""The new oil"" is worth billions of dollars, but we haven't worked out how to extract, refine, sell and establish its value.      We’ve been pretty good about compensating “owners” of oil - the generic, fungible, naturally-made, public good resource that the “owner” did nothing to actually make. But somehow we’re atrocious at compensating the owner of the highly personalized data that they exclusively created. We don’t tell data creators that we’re “mining” them and then we manipulate their subconscious biases via engagement algorithms to get them to take actions that make their data even more valuable. It’s like if an oil company came to your oil-filled swamp and instead of paying you for the rights to extract said oil, they convince you that if you extract, refine, package and leave the oil on your front doorstep that five million strangers may like you.    The new oil is worth billions of dollars, but we haven't worked out how to extract, refine, sell and establish its value.    It’s no secret that the most valuable companies of today are driven by data and artificial intelligence (Google, Facebook, Amazon, and so on). It’s also no surprise that large corporations have been the first to realize the value of the resource and have been extremely efficient in harnessing and monetizing it. It’s super unsurprising they have generally tried wherever possible to keep as much of the value chain for themselves as possible.      We completely exclude data creators to the point where we don’t even have a model to understand how we could do it better. While oil companies from history would happily completely exclude “owners” from the value chain if they could, they haven’t been able to because land ownership is something ingrained in us and because five oil rigs showing up on your property is something people tend to notice.      Who owns the searches you make on Google Chrome? Who owns the words you type into Gmail? There are no rigs, no trucks, no smoke, just opaque terms, and a business model average users find confusing (“everything is free you say?”), and an incredible user experience that happens to deliver creepily targeted ads to you on random webpages. Worse, even if your physical oil is extracted without compensation, a drop of it doesn’t contain your medical records, credit card information, or where your kid goes to school. 2019 saw yet another increase in data breaches (data spills?) partially because of the disparity between how different parties value data and the antiquated methodologies used to protect it.      With ongoing privacy breaches and growing dissatisfaction with how privacy and data are handled, we’re finally starting to demand better of our platforms. Altruism and “doing what’s right” is one way to solve this extraction problem, regulation and establishing penalties for egregious data policies is another, but in our current system the lasting solutions are revenue and profit driven.      Luckily, our data is far more valuable when we share it willingly. Big data’s value is a byproduct of bad data. Extracted data is often bad data and you need sufficient bad data to scrub out the signal from the noise and determine what is actually a valuable insight underneath all the byproduct.      Shared data is timelier, more accurate, more relevant and more ethical. While shared data comes with its own incentive issues, the quality of a platform and insights built on shared data vs. extracted data is night and day. What is the best way to get us to share it willingly? Help us understand why it’s valuable, who it’s valuable to, how we can make it more valuable and then let us share in that value in a simple tangible way. Ideally all of this happens via platforms and behaviours we already do on a day to day basis and value is shared back to us in tangible, creative ways.      In 2020, let’s see commuters earning mobility credits towards free metro rides because they’ve agreed to work with a platform to organize mobility preferences en masse to help municipalities, wellness groups, favorite chain restaurants, scooter companies, real estate investment firms, car manufacturers and other mobility stakeholders in understanding how commuters are moving around a city.This type of shared data-centric optimization is an exciting potential evolution of what Velocia, a Bicameral portfolio project, has recently launched a mobility rewards platform in Miami.      Next year, let's see closed loop platforms start experimenting with open platform ideas like “data-portability” whereby you can use reputation and experience generated on one platform to gain status or better user experience on another platform. For example, we should be able to port driver ratings between Uber and Lyft, or order histories between food delivery apps. This doesn’t even need to be driven by the platform but can begin to be built by third party tool developers. The Open Application Network, another Bicameral portfolio project, has been working to create and popularize these types of tools.      At Bicameral, we’re exploring brand new models whereby we partner with emerging market ISPs and households to leverage valuable shared data profiles to improve the economics of laying expensive fiber broadband directly to the home. Giving households next generation routers and IoT smart-hubs, we can help data creators organize and optimize their 360-degree home data profiles simply by continuing to browse, research, watch, buy and take the digital actions they already do. These profiles can be shared with a transparent insights and analytics platforms to both earn discounts and dollars and increase the quality of data-driven interactions with consumer brands, educational tools, market researchers, government agencies and even protect you from manipulative third-party algorithms and bots.      Let’s be frank, it’s not going to be a data paradise overnight. 2020 isn’t going to be the year we see a world of complete transparency into our data supply chain and we’re not going to be able to pinpoint the exact unit of value we’re getting for the exact piece of meta-data we’re sharing with an exact brand. But we can take meaningful steps forward to change the mindsets of transparency and value sharing. We can create models that leverage our existing hardware, software and consumer behavior to start bringing data creators into the value chain and we can start proving out the model that shared data is better than extracted data.      We can start proving the hypothesis that if you compensate us and help us understand how our data is valuable, we’ll opt in willingly and you don’t have to trick us. Maybe 2020 will even be the year some of us even start turning off data feeds or deleting extractive apps that offer us nothing in return? We may not end up millionaires like the hillbillies, but I’m confident that 2020 will be the year the tide changes and we as data creators start taking our rightful place in the flow.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | MINING,Alex McDougall,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/28/data-creators-should-share-in-the-profits-from-big-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/57aabcc34834e9a3f325b80df9fe7e7934b69287-1200x737.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383110,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uARh,1577532786,Blockchain Projects Are Just Entering the Netscape Phase,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. David Nage is the Principal at Arca, a full service digital asset management firm.            “It is always wise to look ahead, but difficult to look further than you can see.” - Winston Churchill      Recently Jill Carlson wrote a piece for CoinDesk that inspired me to think through counterarguments to the points she shared. Much of the following is based on 100 in-depth interviews during the last year for Base Layer, my podcast. While I am a strong proponent of diversity in thought and opinion, and Jill is one of the most respected investors and thinkers in digital assets, I disagree with her piece for two reasons. One, I believe the time and scale of review doesn’t properly factor where in the maturation cycle things in digital assets are. And two, I believe it diminishes the work being done in the infrastructure of digital assets to propel adoption.      When I talk to my former peers in the family office world, I often discuss parallels between digital assets and past periods of technological innovations. The digital asset ecosystem needs to evaluate its progress (or lack thereof) against the historical diffusion of innovation. Below I discuss some key project updates with releases this year, showing maturation of the technology ecosystem.      A quick incidental point first. Jill’s article is titled “Cryptocurrency Is Most Useful for Breaking Laws,” which is apt. As Jérôme Blanchart describes in his book “Crimes of the Future,” criminals have always been early adopters of new technology. For example, the Bonnot Gang, a French criminal anarchist group that was active in the 1910s, were among the first to make use of a getaway car after their armed robberies. The police would pursue them were on bicycles or horseback.    Perspective is key    In the early to mid-1990s, I remember my family getting our first home PC, connecting a modem and hearing that horrible dial-up sound when signing onto AOL. It didn’t always connect and, many times when it did, it was painfully slow. I remember ugly hyperlinked websites and thinking, “No way am I putting a credit card into this and buying something.” Then in 1997-98, when I got to college, second-generation websites started popping up with better UI/UX. There was vastly better developer tooling, improved infrastructure, encryption and regulatory clarity. I think a lot of people who question crypto and blockchain now forget, or didn’t experience, these early days.      Jill writes about how we are collectively evaluating digital assets and makes a determination that: “I think perhaps we have been judging cryptocurrencies’ success (or lack thereof) according to a false metric. We would not judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree.”      Our judgment is marred by our collective timescales and expectations. We have become a society of “now.” Venturing outdoors to rent a movie, buy food or other household supplies has been replaced by a click of Netflix, Postmates and Amazon Prime. We expect to plug in a device or download an app and for it to work perfectly. In the early days, we just hoped we didn’t blow up our computer.    Because of our on-demand mentality, we have lost patience.    This shift in mindset to “on demand” has altered our idea of how quickly things should happen and, in my opinion, has negatively affected our perspective on digital assets and blockchains. Most blockchain technology appearing now started as academic theory 20 or 30 years ago. For example, zero-knowledge proofs were first conceived in 1989 by Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff in their paper ""The Knowledge Complexity of Interactive Proof-Systems.”      In 1968, Douglas Engelbart gave what is known as ""The Mother of All Demos"": a live demonstration featuring the introduction of a complete computer hardware and software system called NLS. The 90-minute presentation demonstrated almost all the fundamental elements of modern personal computing: windows, hypertext, graphics, efficient navigation and command input, video conferencing, the computer mouse and word processing. It wasn’t until the late-1990s that home computers with all of these capabilities entered our homes and workforces.      Jill says digital assets don't provide “marginal improvements"" on legacy financial services and systems and that ""often blockchain-based systems will fail when compared to more conventional, centralized solutions.” However, in my opinion, there are companies and projects in the works that address problems in the financial system. To paraphrase Marc Andreessen, I believe we just entering the Netscape phase of digital assets.    Promising projects    Wyre, a company that predominantly uses the bitcoin blockchain, cuts the time and expense of cross border payments. While banks take up to three days and charge between 4 percent and 6 percent for international money transfers, Wyre completes transactions in less than six hours, charging less than 1 percent.      One of the more important developments in 2019 was the mainnet launch of Cosmos, an interoperable blockchain protocol that began work five years ago. It facilitates the transfer of data between existing chains creating an internet-of-blockchains. Prior to 2019 we have had disparate, distributed and decentralized systems being built to handle file storage, query, search and more – components necessary to build robust applications comparable to Web 1.0-2.0. Those components need to talk to each other and, without protocols like Cosmos, that becomes fairly impossible.      In a similar vein, 0x is a protocol that facilitates the peer-to-peer exchange of Ethereum-based assets. It released Version 3 to it protocol this year, an upgrade that will deepen liquidity for the DeFi ecosystem and improve the developer experience of building on 0x.      Meanwhile, projects are improving how they handle governance: the ability to get distributed groups of network facilitators to work together. Aragon is one of the most important projects in the space and after two years of design, development, and testing, the Aragon Client went live on mainnet for the first time near the end of 2018. By September 2019, Aragon One shipped Aragon 0.8 featuring a vastly improved on-boarding and user experience.      This year Parity led the way with a major advance in Substrate, Parity Technologies' blockchain framework. Substrate's modular architecture abstracts away as much blockchain development as possible, freeing teams to focus on crafting their project's unique business logic. It could have a similar impact as Wix, which launched in 2006, making website development simple and easy for anyone.      Argent shipped a “radically better crypto wallet,” targeting one of the major pain points in crypto (seed phrases). It has shown that you can be self-custodial/decentralized. Argent uses a system called Guardians where you can pick any ethereum address to help recover your wallet. Guardians can also lock it and approve transfers over your daily limit. Now, if you lose your phone, you can recover your wallet in a couple of taps.      People who claim “nothing has happened yet,” or that digital assets and blockchains only have limited use cases such as breaking laws or social contracts, only see patches of the quilt. Because of our on-demand mentality, we have lost patience. We expect things to work immediately. But this buildout is a tectonic shift, not only for those building and participating in these new applications and platforms, but for the people who will eventually use them. It takes time.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | ZRX,David Nage,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/28/blockchain-projects-are-just-entering-the-netscape-phase,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/223d88b7e2c4f8bb3448b099998c2dbdc0abf91b-1322x686.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
