42383052,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9trAX,1575411905,State Street Slashes DLT Developer Team as Bank Rethinks Blockchain Strategy,"State Street, the global custodian bank, has taken a new direction with its blockchain strategy and cut scores of developer jobs in the process, people familiar with the situation said.       The focus is now more on digital assets such as tokenized stocks and bonds through to cryptocurrencies, rather than the heavy lifting work of re-plumbing front to back office with distributed ledger technology (DLT).       Because of various cost pressures weighing on the Boston-based bank, there has been a dramatic streamlining of the global blockchain team in the past few weeks. A former State Street engineer, who wanted to remain nameless, said the cuts numbered over 100 blockchain developers.       A second person familiar with the situation said “most of the blockchain team had gone,” and that the number let go was “upwards of 100.” There are now “only a few token people left” from the team, this person said, meaning “token” as in perfunctory, not in the crypto sense.       (All told, State Street has 39,407 employees worldwide, according to its latest quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission).       “They are moving away from this giant in-house DLT initiative,” the source said of State Street. “They are more focused on digital assets, stablecoins, custody, and the USC initiative [the Utility Settlement Coin being developed by bank consortium Fnality].”       Ralph Achkar, managing director of digital products at State Street in London, acknowledged that it had “streamlined some of the people in those teams,” declining to give exact numbers of those let go.       But that streamlining should not be taken to mean “we are not focused on distributed ledger,” he said. “That is absolutely not the case.”       Innovator’s dilemma       Previously, a large DLT team at State Street had been working with the Hyperledger Fabric open-source permissioned blockchain software.       The aim was to create a single book of record, which could run State Street’s investment book at the front end, an accounting book of record for the middleware and a custody book of record on the back end. This new DLT system would remove the need to reconcile between hundreds of databases, involving hundreds of man-hours each day.       Now, however, the bank is now describing its approach as “ledger-agnostic,” and relying more on outside providers.       “If something is Fabric-related we still have some Fabric engineers on board,” said Achkar, who runs a digital asset product development and innovation team in London, complemented by similar teams in the U.S. and Singapore. But his objective is to identify the best business cases, rather than the best protocol, he said.       “I think the choice in approaching that space was, do we need to have all of these resources internally, or can we actually build partnerships and work with other providers in the market?” he said.       Most big banks face the same issues as State Street in grappling with how best to upgrade legacy systems. When the system in question controls over $30 trillion in asset movements, digital transformation is not going to happen overnight.       “There is an innovator’s dilemma,” said Achkar, using a well-known term for the challenge to large incumbent players of adopting technologies that would disrupt their business models. “What we recognize is that some of the processes that might appear to be inefficient in the market today are there for a reason.”       Market rules and market structure have been put in place to ensure bad behaviors can be detected early on, or prevented altogether, he said. “We don’t believe that you are going to throw everything you have done away and replace it with new tech and everything is resolved. It's hard to imagine it happening that way.”       New kid on the block       In any case, State Street’s loss has turned out to be a gain for others.       Moiz Kohari, the former global chief technology architect at State Street, who left the bank in April to co-found DLT-based data privacy startup Manetu, has been busy hiring.       According to its website, Manetu has so far hired former State Street senior vice president Greg Haskins, as chief technology officer; former SVP of enterprise data Conor Allen as head of product; and former managing director Binh Nguyen as chief scientist.       “I on-boarded some of the big names to my Manetu team on Nov. 5,” said Kohari. “There are others from the bank behind them who I’m not going to name; multiple maintainers on the Hyperledger project.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/03/state-street-slashes-dlt-developer-team-as-bank-rethinks-blockchain-strategy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/78b1540708661d7cfe29562e1db8ded1e84727c3-1500x987.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383058,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9trFZ,1575404111,Freedom Fighter or Fool? Jury's Out on Arrested Ethereum Developer Virgil Griffith,"Did Virgil Griffith go too far with the idea of ethereum as a ""world computer""?      The Ethereum Foundation researcher was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport on Thanksgiving for traveling to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) earlier this year. Griffith attended the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference in April and is accused by U.S. authorities of giving the North Korean regime information on how to use cryptocurrency to evade sanctions. He's expected to be released on bail in the coming weeks.      Griffith’s arrest sparked debate across Crypto Twitter about whether giving a lecture with public information about open-source projects, and potentially suggesting how to use them, constitutes a violation of economic sanctions or an act of admirably spreading ethereum’s gospel of global reinvention.      Across the ethereum community, the jury is still out as to whether Griffith’s choices are heroic, reprehensible or just plain foolish. Some are comparing him to the cypherpunk folk hero Ross Ulbricht, currently serving a life sentence for operating the Silk Road black market. On the other hand, critics like journalist Laura Shin are tweeting that Griffith could only have helped the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.      In a statement, Griffith's lawyer, Brian Klein of Baker Marquart, said, ""We dispute the untested allegations in the criminal complaint. Virgil looks forward to his day in court, when the full story can come out.""      Much remains unclear, including what exactly went down at the April conference in Pyongyang. Alejandro Cao de Benós – the Spanish-born DPRK booster who helped organize the conference – told CoinDesk in June that the idea of creating a DPRK cryptocurrency was raised at the event by foreigners who belonged to ""organizations related to the top five cryptocurrencies.""      However, another attendee, Fabio Pietrosanti, said this week that the conference did not touch the subject of sanctions evasion, or much of anything significant for that matter.      Even before the trip, though, Griffith openly expressed interest in arranging crypto-related equipment shipments to North Korea in 2018, Reuters reported citing anonymous sources. He was also not shy to publicize his travel plans, using Twitter to invite Spankchain advisor and porn star Brenna Sparks to travel with him.      In June, Griffith tweeted there was a “market opportunity” for North Korea to create a cryptocurrency exchange without know-your-customer compliance requirements. The FBI complaint claims Griffith also floated the idea of sending cryptocurrency between DPRK and South Korea, but the transaction never happened.      ‘Special Projects’    Griffith, 36, has long been a contentious yet beloved figure in the broader tech world. He has irresistible dimples and a patient manner when explaining tricky computer-science tradeoffs.      In 2008 the New York Times described him as a “troublemaker … and a magnet for tech-world groupies.” His initial fame came from creating WikiScanner, a publicly searchable database that linked anonymous Wikipedia edits to the organizations where those edits seemed to originate. He’s since become the center of several controversies related to ethics and computer science.      In 2013, he befriended Vitalik Buterin. Like so many privacy-minded technologists hanging out in certain corners of the internet, they were both young bitcoiners looking to make their mark with this new blockchain technology. Buterin founded the Ethereum Foundation in Switzerland in 2014 to fund the development of the then-nascent cryptocurrency he created.      In an interview in May, Griffith said he offered private feedback but declined to join the project because it felt too ambitious, technically speaking.      ""I've known Vitalik longer than anyone else in the foundation,” Griffith said, describing himself as a mentor. Indeed, some in the ethereum community said they consider him a paternal leader to many project participants.      Griffith said he was one of the first people to see Buterin’s early drafts of the ethereum white paper, when Griffith was still a Ph.D. student at Caltech. Around that same time Buterin was revising the paper, Griffith posted his first tweet about wanting to visit DPRK.      He finally joined Buterin’s foundation as “head of special projects” in 2016, after he was rebuked by many in the Tor community for contacting the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) and authorities in Singapore. Although Tor browser users seek to anonymize themselves by bouncing traffic across a dizzying mesh of participants, Griffith collected and offered to sell parts of users’ IP addresses, requested onion hostnames, timestamps and HTTP response codes.      Griffith defended this choice by saying he felt ads were crucial to sustaining the Tor project and he hoped to sell “minimized logs” of user activity, an arrangement that he argued still offers more privacy than Google AdSense.      These days, he appears to have been looking for ways to take ethereum mainstream through other types of government participation, namely nonprofit funding and nationalized blockchain projects.      ""Most of them [special projects] I can't tell you about,” Griffith said during an interview in May about his efforts to promote ethereum in places like Saudi Arabia. “They're kind of moonshots. They have a high upside if they work and low downside if they don't work.”      Griffith was also a co-chair of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) for corporations. Griffith owns and operates Ethereum Research, a website the entire ethereum community relies on. Several community members have backed up and mirrored the data there since his arrest, in case the site is taken down.      Following his arrest last week, the Ethereum Foundation released a statement saying Griffith’s trip was a personal vacation taken without any support from the nonprofit. But it wasn't the first time an ethereum leader met with a controversial political figure; Buterin famously met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2017. That meeting, according to Time magazine, led to the genesis of the petro, Venezuela's digital currency project that Russia is supporting.      Neither Buterin nor the foundation was available for further comment by press time. The EEA did not respond to requests for comment, but Griffith’s name is no longer listed as co-chair on the website.    Twitter debates    In defense of his incarcerated friend, Buterin tweeted Sunday that U.S. authorities are needlessly “going after programmers delivering speeches” based on public information. (He did not address the prosecutors' allegation that the State Department denied Griffith permission to travel to North Korea.) ConsenSys engineer Joseph Delong started a petition to have all pending or potential charges against Griffith dropped, using the hashtag #FreeVirgil.      Some ethereum fans are already comparing Griffith to the late computer legend Aaron Swartz, who committed suicide in 2013 after the U.S. government indicted him for illegally publishing academic research. Swartz and Griffith were friends who worked together on the Tor project. However, there are significant differences between these legal cases.      Attorney Zoe Dolan, who represented Osama bin Laden’s son-in-law Sulaiman Abu Ghaith when he was convicted of “conspiracy to kill Americans” and aiding terrorism, said Griffith’s arrest is a unique case because it may be adjacent to matters of national security and diplomacy.      Even unaffiliated bystanders, like Switzerland-based attorney and Iranian expat Fatemeh Fannizadeh, are tweeting there’s no clear distinction between promoting censorship-resistant technology and supporting non-compliant transactions on some level.      Preston Byrne, a partner at the law firm Byrne & Storm, said it's a “teachable moment” for the Ethereum Foundation. ""Every business has to be alert to a wide array of risks, and that includes risks arising from social media and the out-of-office behavior of senior staff,"" he said.      Meanwhile, Shin argued censorship inside North Korea is so severe that Griffith’s educational talk could only help the notoriously repressive Kim administration; civilians aren’t even allowed access to the internet. Along those lines, Human Rights Foundation executive Alex Gladstein tweeted “it is terrible for anyone to provide technical training to the Kim regime.”      Most ethereum fans don’t seem to see it that way, however. Entrepreneur Enrico Talin described Griffith as a “man of peace” whose controversial DPRK talk was titled “Blockchain and Peace.” In a blog post supporting Griffith, Talin recounted a conversation where the researcher allegedly described ethereum as a road to peace that the U.S. government “can’t stop.”      Beyond ethereum diehards, even early bitcoin evangelist and bitcoin cash investor Roger Ver tweeted Griffith’s actions were a form of anti-war activism.      Likewise, the EEA member said he sees this as a case of the “police state” restricting academic collaboration across borders, even though he also acknowledges “none of us are trained diplomats.” He added this arrest might discourage technologists seeking to work with peers in places like Iran or Venezuela.      On the other hand, some community accounts portray Griffith as a rogue diplomat spreading the blockchain revolution.      As such, the anonymous ethereum fan from the EEA said they need to take the “larger movement” more seriously and recruit people with actual experience in politics or lobbying.      This highly publicized arrest may be a “turning point” for ethereum, the EEA member said.      “As long as it stays in the limelight, the more inclined the prosecution may [be] to make an example out of it,"" Dolan said of Griffith’s case. “The Southern District of New York has historically been shown to be a leader, across the nation, in departing below the United States sentencing guidelines. But that's not necessarily true in white-collar cases.”      Christine Kim contributed reporting.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/03/freedom-fighter-or-fool-jurys-out-on-arrested-ethereum-developer-virgil-griffith,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83f8dad2e1a8317be3d58e0a317e025049c060f1-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374512,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWva0Bt,1575401104,Ethereum Devs Reconsider ‘Difficulty Bomb’ Timing as Hard Forks Loom,"Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP) 2387, created in mid-November, would tentatively schedule a Jan. 6 hard fork to delay the “difficulty bomb” or “Ice Age” from going off for another 4,000,000 blocks or about 611 days. The hard fork is dubbed “Muir Glacier,” after the retreating Alaskan glacier.  Slated for block number 9,069,000, the hard fork contains a bridge between the current chain, based on a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, and the Beacon Chain, or the first phase of the so-called Eth 2.0 transition to PoS.  With other networks like EOS, Binance Chain and Substrate looking to pick off projects from Ethereum, developers voiced concerns on a call last Friday over maintaining the current chain’s health as the transition to Eth 2.0 occurs. Complicating matters, the network’s next major hard fork, Istanbul, is now slated for Saturday.  If developers fail to agree on Muir Glacier soon, which remains unlikely after reaching rough consensus on a developer call last week, block times will continue to move upward, restricting the current network’s capabilities as transaction fees crowd out users.  The difficulty bomb, explained  A piece of code embedded in 2015, the difficulty bomb is one of two components which gradually increases the hashing difficulty on the Ethereum blockchain, meant to force the network towards PoS with the Serenity network overhaul, currently slated for 2021.  Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum features a mining difficulty adjustment scheme to control the output of ether rewards for mining on the network, which the bomb is a part of.  Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum’s pending difficulty bomb will increase the time it takes to mine a block – typically between 10 and 20 seconds – every 100,000 blocks. Since the difficulty bomb is based on when blocks are mined, knowing when the network will feel the effects is more art than science.  EIP 2387 would be the third time since 2015 the bomb’s fuse has been extended, first by 3 million blocks in the 2018 Byzantium hard fork and then by another 2 million blocks in the February 2019 Constantinople hard fork.  High settlement times are not alien to Ethereum. As data provider Etherscan shows, block times soared before both the Byzantium and Constantinople hard forks, hitting over 30 and 20 seconds, respectively.  “It looks like given faster block times since Constantinople, it was a bit underestimated on when [high transaction fees] would hit again,” Ethereum developer Eric Conner said in a private message. “People were under the assumption we had until the next fork after Istanbul, but actually it’s slowly kicking in now.”  In light of the earlier-than-expected uptick, Conner drafted EIP 2384, the Istanbul/Berlin Difficulty Bomb Delay, included in EIP 2387. In a little over six weeks, block times have increased from 13.1 to 14.3 seconds, Conner said. And, as the difficulty bomb is an exponential feature of Ethereum, a one-second change has large implications down the road.  Keeping up with the network  Although the difficulty bomb is an original feature of Ethereum, some developers have called for getting rid it altogether. After all, its launch has been punted every time it becomes inconvenient.  Some see the logic in maintaining the original design, however. It does force Ethereum clients to stay on top of updates or face increasing costs to run on the network.  “The strongest argument for keeping some kind of expiry is to ensure that there is no option for ‘do nothing,’” Ethereum developer Micah Zoltu said in a private message.  “The issue is more around stakeholders just simply no longer paying attention and not upgrading their clients,” he said. “The bomb is about ensuring people have to make a conscious decision to fork in the face of regular network upgrades.”  For now, EIP 2384 currently stands on last call for comment among Ethereum developers. EIP 2387 reached rough consensus in last Friday’s call, but awaits both finalization of EIP 2384 and acceptance by Ethereum clients such as Parity or Geth before network implementation.  “I’m on the fence between cutting out the bomb entirely and just changing the way the bomb works,” Zoltu said. “What I’m against is keeping the bomb implemented as it is.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | FORKS,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/03/ethereum-devs-reconsider-difficulty-bomb-timing-as-hard-forks-loom,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e6bc7cc858ac30f6e11477a2285c229afa6dec8-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383070,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9trUf,1575396005,Global Android Vulnerability Could Grab Wallet and Banking Data,"A newly-discovered vulnerability, called StrandHogg, could allow hackers access to private data on almost any Android phone and has already been used to access banking information. Documented by security firm Promon, the exploit affects all versions of Android.      The StrandHogg exploit isn't particularly new – security researchers have known about a proof-of-concept version since 2015. A working, and potentially dangerous, version of the exploit only recently appeared in the wild hidden inside malware that has been propagating across the internet for the past year. Promon created an informational page for the exploit after discovering how widespread and dangerous it could be.      The exploit interrupts the flow of an app from launch to welcome screen and forces a user to give a piece of malware powerful permissions before letting the legitimate app run.      ""Our researchers focused on describing the vulnerability, as such, but we also collaborated with Lookout Security who contributed some parts by scanning their datasets of malware. They found 36 malicious apps that exploit the flaw,"" said Lars Lunde Birkeland, Promon's Marketing & Communication Director.      ""We tested the top 500 most popular apps and all of them are vulnerable,"" he said.      All versions of Android, including Android 10, are affected and even patched, seemingly secure phones are allegedly vulnerable according to Promon.    Hiding in plain sight    The exploit works by highjacking a legitimate app as it's launched on almost any Android phone. Instead of going to the welcome screen or login page, the exploit allows a piece of malware to display so-called permissions pop-ups, the kind that asks if the app can access your contacts, location, and stored data. When you approve the request, the malware is given all of the permissions instead of the legitimate app, which continues to run as if nothing happened.      ""The victim clicks on the legit app but instead of being directed to the legit app the malware tricks the device to show a permission pop-up. The victim gives the malware and the attacker the permissions and then you're redirected to the legit app,"" said Birkeland.      The researchers found that a Trojan program called BankBot used the exploit to give itself powerful permissions that could intercept SMS messages, log keypresses, forward calls, and even lock a phone until you pay a ransom, a concern for anyone running banking, financial, or wallet apps on their phone.      ""It's a well-known banking Trojan and is seen in every country in the world,"" said Birkeland.      The exploit can also show a fake login page for some apps on some Android phones but the permissions exploit is far more common.    Serious business    ""The vulnerability is quite serious. You, as an attacker, are able to carry out quite powerful attacks,"" said Birkeland.      Promon discovered the malware when ""several banks in the Czech Republic had reported money disappearing from customer accounts,"" wrote the researchers.      ""From here, through its research, Promon was able to identify the malware was being used to exploit a dangerous Android vulnerability. Lookout, a partner of Promon, also confirmed that they have identified 36 malicious apps exploiting the vulnerability. Among them were variants of the BankBot banking trojan observed as early as 2017,"" they wrote.      ""While Google has removed the affected apps, to the best of our knowledge, the vulnerability has not yet been fixed for any version of Android (incl. Android 10),"" wrote the researchers.      Why is it called Strandhogg? That has to do with the company's Swedish roots.      ""The vulnerability has been named by Promon as ‘StrandHogg’, old Norse for the Viking tactic of raiding coastal areas to plunder and hold people for ransom,"" wrote the researchers.      In a statement, a Google spokesperson said: “We appreciate the researchers' work, and have suspended the potentially harmful apps they identified. Google Play Protect detects and blocks malicious apps, including ones using this technique. Additionally, we’re continuing to investigate in order to improve Google Play Protect’s ability to protect users against similar issues.""",NEGATIVE,없음,RESEARCH,John Biggs,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/03/global-android-vulnerability-could-grab-wallet-and-banking-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/594e8acd612c82b54e69ba7a9dbae8208ef70a77-1600x1600.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383063,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9trLr,1575393092,Placeholder Leads $2 Million Seed Round for DeFi Services Provider Zerion,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) startup Zerion is building out its team with a $2 million investment from venture capital firms Placeholder, Blockchain.com Ventures and Gnosis.      According to a press release, Zerion provides a number of financial services using decentralized protocols, including credit creation, insurance and asset management. The company says it is able to provide these services more cheaply than existing centralized solutions.      CEO Evgeny Yurtaev told CoinDesk that the seed funding will primarily go towards adding support for new protocols – to date, Zerion supports MakerDAO, Compound, Uniswap and others – as well as hiring some additional developers.      Over the past five months, Zerion has processed just under $50 million in transaction volume, with a user experience interface designed to allow non-technical users to participate.      Much of its protocol integration comes from user feedback, Yurtaev said.      In a statement, Placeholder venture partner Brad Burnham said Zerion is providing a more accessible infrastructure for DeFi, which could allow it to reach a mainstream audience.      “Back in the '90s many of us intuitively understood the Internet was a powerful new infrastructure but it took Marc Andreeseen with Mosaic and then Netscape to make this powerful new infrastructure accessible to a broader audience,” he said in the statement. “DeFi, or decentralized finance, feels just as profoundly transformative today as the Internet did then, but it is still too hard to use.”      Blockchain.com Ventures managing partner Samuel Harrison added that DeFi could address use cases not well-served by the traditional financial infrastructure.      Yurtaev said the company is not looking to be the only such infrastructure provider.      “There’s a huge discussion about how Facebook and Google monopolize data and we were thinking about … in Web 3.0 this shouldn’t happen,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MKR | SPONSORED | UNI,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/03/placeholder-leads-2-million-seed-round-for-defi-services-provider-zerion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a29215a095a12d573bef0b65125295dc83abf7c2-2520x2093.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383071,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9trTP,1575389120,China's Internet Firewall Has Blocked Access to Ethereum Block Explorer Etherscan.io,"China's Great Firewall, used by the government to regulate access to foreign internet sites, has blocked one of the most popular sources of ethereum blockchain data.      As of Tuesday, etherscan.io, one of the longest-running and most widely used ethereum block explorers, was inaccessible from IP addresses inside mainland China, based on tests performed locally.      The change appears to be recent. According to Greatfire.org, which compiles and monitors a database of sites that are blocked inside China, etherscan.io was still accessible with ""no censorship detected"" as of Aug. 18, 2019.      But Greatfire.org's scanning record shows etherscan.io has become 100 percent blocked since at least Oct. 30, rendering it inaccessible from inside China unless via a virtual private network (VPN).      This is likely the first known case of a blockchain explorer becoming an internet firewall target and puts etherscan.io in the company of such blocked information and social media sites as Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit.      ""This is another instance of friction between the decentralized and immutable technology of blockchain and the tightly controlled, centralized government of China,"" said Matthew Graham, CEO of blockchain investment firm Sino Global Capital. ""We should expect additional problems like these in the future as blockchain is integrated further into the Chinese economy and daily life.""    Reasons unclear      It's not immediately clear what exactly led to the blocking of a blockchain explorer in China. But last year, there were reports that cryptocurrency users encoded censored articles regarding the #Metoo movement and a pharmaceutical scandal in China onto ethereum transactions in a bid to bypass internet censorship.      Internet users had been sharing on WeChat the hash of those transactions using etherscan.io, which even prompted WeChat to later block users from viewing the exact etherscan.io URLs from inside the messaging app. Etherscan.io's site itself remained intact at the time.      ""Some have used this feature to post sensitive messages without the need to worry about the message being blocked or removed, or their identity being exposed,"" said Graham. ""Anyone with a blockchain explorer like Etherscan can view these messages, so it is not surprising that this website has come in the crosshairs of internet censors.""      Matthew Tan, founder and CEO of etherscan, said his firm noticed the block ”within the last 3 months"" but was unsure of the exact date. He said he doesn't know why this occurred and thus ""can not speculate on what the reasons might be.""      Substitute site    There is evidence that the blockage may have happened sometime in September and went largely unnoticed.      For instance, MakerDAO, the decentralized finance project, switched from using etherscan.io in a WeChat post in Chinese on Sept. 16 to using a new etherscan site – cn.etherscan.com – in another post on Sept. 30. The new site, which appears identical to etherscan.io, is currently accessible from inside China.        To be clear, a blockchain explorer is merely an online portal that makes it easier for end-users to browse transaction information of a decentralized network. The actual blockchain transactions are not stored in any centralized database and thus can't be taken down by a single entity regardless of geographic locations.      So far, other ethereum explorers are still accessible from inside mainland China.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MKR | TECHNOLOGY,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/03/chinas-internet-firewall-has-blocked-access-to-ethereum-block-explorer-etherscanio,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e07ffeb7f5b0f697710eaf647f15ac0118ac01a4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383065,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9trN7,1575384000,Court Backs Nordea Bank Bid to Block Staff From Trading Crypto,"Nordea Bank has won a court battle over its bid to bar employees from buying and selling cryptocurrencies outside of work.      Bloomberg reported Tuesday that a Danish court had ruled that the northern European bank is justified in the ban due to the risks associated with cryptocurrencies.      The case was brought against Nordea by a financial industry union in Denmark, claiming a crypto ban would interfere with the personal lives of staff.      “We filed suit because of the principle that everyone obviously has a private life and the right to act as a private individual,” union chairman Kent Petersen said in a statement. “It was important for us and our members to establish what rights managers have. In this case, it was more far-reaching than what we find to be appropriate.”      Expressing concerns over harm to the reputation of the bank and its clients, Nordea had warned its employees in early 2018 against crypto trading because “the risks were too high.” The bank cited a lack of regulation and connections to criminal activity such as money laundering to back up its case, Bloomberg writes.      Staff would still be allowed to invest in financial instruments tied to cryptocurrencies and were not prohibited from holding cryptos purchased before the ban.      Some commentators are pointing out on crypto Twitter that the staff ban is perhaps ironic, as Nordea itself has been accused of money laundering.      Reuters reported in March that Finnish broadcaster Yle said leaked documents showed the financial group had allegedly handled €700 million euros ($775 million) in suspicious transactions between 2005 and 2017 that were linked to Russia. In its defense, the bank said it had reported suspicious behavior to relevant authorities.      Then, in June, the bank's offices were searched by the Danish state prosecutor as part of a criminal investigation into money laundering.      Sweden's financial watchdog also warned the firm in 2018 over deficiencies in how it followed anti-money laundering rules, according to another Bloomberg piece at the time.",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/03/court-backs-nordea-bank-bid-to-block-staff-from-trading-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f88bc355ad2ca3bf9e2da6fc20d1e1e26a0693fc-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383054,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9trBn,1575381600,Zcash Foundation Funds App Mixing Private Messaging and Payments,"The Canadian nonprofit Open Privacy is working on Cwtch, a zcash-fueled messaging app with more decentralization than Telegram or Signal.      “Cwtch is focused on building a decentralized infrastructure,” said Open Privacy founder Sarah Jamie Lewis. “It can’t be reliant on Visa or Venmo unless we can find a way to remove that metadata.”      The project is still in an early stage of messaging between roughly a dozen node and server operators. Now, thanks to a donation from the Zcash Foundation of roughly $40,000, the nonprofit will hire a designer and continue research on the payment aspects of the system.      “Think of it like a prepaid card,” Lewis said. “You would top off at some point using zcash or any other payment methods.”      Lewis said Cwtch (a Welsh word for hug pronounced something like “kutch”) was inspired by market research with sex workers and queer communities that experienced censorship and malicious surveillance. As such, Open Privacy is looking into multiple options, including bitcoin, diverse on-ramps and liquidity.      “There are ways to minimize some of those issues and get around them,” she said in reference to bitcoin’s public ledger and lack of capacity for direct encrypted messages.    UX hurdles    It is unclear at this stage how Open Privacy will overcome the user experience challenges, however. Even the zcash option will rely on shielded transactions, which requires a node that very few people know how to operate. Part of this grant will go toward hiring a designer and conducting more research, Lewis said.      “Server-side support is only half the battle, and the most critical aspect of this whole endeavour will be getting people who use Cwtch to a position where they can easily use zcash (and possibly other cryptocurrencies with similar properties) to pay for anonymous services, or even accept it themselves,” Open Privacy said in a press statement.      So far, some of the greatest needs appear to be personal ads, such as those Craigslist or Backpage used to offer, and dating app–like features. It would also need to be discreet, since Lewis said some people are subjected to “systematic or personal violence” if they are found by authorities to have apps like Grindr on their phones.      To address this, the app works almost like bitcoin in that everyone downloads a ledger of all the messages, some of which are public. The difference is, private keys and user identifiers can be used to unlock certain conversations, including private group chats and direct messages.      George Tankersley, the Zcash Foundation’s director of engineering, said he hopes to incorporate insights and feedback from Cwtch into the “Zebra” zcash implementation.      “One of our goals … is to do more work with external users and even competitors of zcash and to allow that to drive our priorities going into 2020,” Tankersley said.      Open Privacy, founded in 2018, is funded primarily through user donations of bitcoin, zcash and monero.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | WALLET | ZEC | RESEARCH,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/03/zcash-foundation-funds-app-mixing-private-messaging-and-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d49362de33453cabc162c082dae0d1f28947d784-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At press time, the WisdomTree ETP (ticker symbol BTCW) is live on SIX's platform, but showing no volume as of yet. A physically backed product is settled in the underlying asset, not a cash equivalent.      WisdomTree said its Bitcoin ETP gives investors ""a simple, secure and cost-efficient way to gain exposure to Bitcoin while utilising the best of traditional financial infrastructure and product structuring.""      With the product there is no need to hold the cryptocurrency directly, with the firm saying it employs ""institutional grade storage solutions"" for the bitcoin underlying the product. As with gold ETPs, investors in the bitcoin product will have an entitlement to the cryptocurrency underlying it.      “We have been monitoring cryptocurrencies for some time and ... have seen enough to believe that digital assets, like Bitcoin, are not a passing trend and can play a role in portfolios,"" said Alexis Marinof, head of Europe at WisdomTree.      The firm sees ""many parallels"" between cryptocurrency and commodities, according to Marinof, whose firm has been providing gold-based ETPs in Europe since 2003.      While the product is currently available for professional investors only, WisdomTree said it hopes that a cryptocurrency ETP may soon receive regulatory approval for wider access by retail investors too.      “[W]e see blockchain technology and digital currencies as being transformative for the asset management industry,"" said WisdomTree CEO Jonathan Steinberg.

42383061,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9trJL,1575371515,Bitcoin to See Return of Bull Cross That Marked Onset of 2016-17 Price Rally,"View  Bitcoin’s 50- and 100-week moving averages (MAs) look set to produce a bullish crossover next week. Back in 2016, the same cross marked the start of a long-term bull market.  Prices could rise to key trendline resistance at $7,600 in the short-term. A break higher would expose the recent high of $7,870.  The short-term bullish case would be invalidated if prices drop below $6,847.    A bitcoin price indicator that marked the beginning of the 2016-17 bull market is about to make another appearance.      The cryptocurrency's 50-week MA is on track to cross above the 100-week MA next week. The resulting bullish crossover would be the first since May 2016, according to Bitstamp data.      MA crossovers are momentum indicators and help traders gauge the market trend. A bullish cross, therefore, suggests a rally is about to gather steam or a bull market is on the horizon.      It's worth noting that MA studies are based on historical data and that crossovers, especially longer duration ones, tend to lag prices. For instance, the 50-week MA is based on one-year-old data and the 100-week MA is sensitive to the price action seen over the last two years.      Put simply, the price rise from the December 2018 low of $3,122 to the June 2019 high of $13,880 has put the 50-week MA on an upward trajectory.      So it could be argued that the impending bull cross is a lagging indicator and has limited predictive powers.      Even so, the chart pattern warrants attention due to the fact that bitcoin broke into a 19-month long uptrend with the bullish crossover of the same averages in May 2016.    Weekly chart (2015-2017)    The 50-week MA found acceptance above the 100-week MA in the last week of May 2016, following which the cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid near $430 and charted its way a record high of around $20,000 in December 2017.      The low of $377 registered four weeks ahead of the confirmation of the crossover was never put to test again.      (Interestingly, bitcoin's bear market from the December 2013 highs above $1,160 ran out of steam with a bearish crossover of the same two averages in April 2015.)      Similar price action was observed earlier this year, as seen below.    Weekly chart (2018-19)    Bitcoin charted a higher low of $3,700 in February, despite confirmation of a bear cross, signaling an end of the bear market following record highs near $20,000.      With history perhaps looking to repeat itself, there's some reason to believe the upcoming bull cross of the 50- and 100-week MAs could bode well for bitcoin.      As for the next 24 hours, the probability of bitcoin witnessing an upside move is high. At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $7,270 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.75 percent drop on the day.    Daily and three-day charts    The long lower wicks attached to the previous two daily candles represent a rejection of lower prices or seller exhaustion. This, coupled with the MACD histogram's bullish turn to above zero indicates scope for a re-test of the descending trendline, currently at $7,600.      Also, with prices holding well above $6,847, the bullish hammer reversal pattern confirmed on the three-day chart last week is still valid.      That pattern would be invalidated if prices drop below $6,847, opening the doors for re-test of recent lows near $6,500.

42383064,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9trKb,1575369000,"Institutions Are Showing Interest in ETP Tied to Binance Coin, Amun Says","Swiss crypto investment product provider Amun says it has received significant institutional interest in its exchange-traded product (ETP) tied to the Binance Coin (BNB) exchange token.      Amun’s Managing Director and Head of ETFs, Laurent Kssis, said the company’s European roadshow in London, Zurich, Milan and Scandinavia is already “fully booked” with meetings with representatives from over 30 institutional investors across the continent.      The event, which began last week and is expected to continue through Friday, is marketing the BNB ETP to potential clients. These are primarily ""qualified investors who may have a mandate to allow exposure to crypto as part of a much broader portfolio of assets,'' said Kssis.       Meetings have been with hedge funds and family offices, with some also scheduled with asset managers. One-to-one sessions were oversubscribed, so Amun has added more events, including a lunch meeting, for investors to participate in.       Obviously, taking a meeting isn’t the same as making a purchase. But institutional interest may signal that such big-money investors are starting to broaden their crypto horizons beyond bitcoin.     The ETP and BNB    The ETP is listed on Swiss stock exchange SIX and was created in conjunction with Binance and launched in October. Each tradeable unit tracks just over 1 BNB, providing institutional investors with exposure to the exchange’s ecosystem through a regulated, conventional product.      Amun launched its first crypto ETP in October 2018, tracking a basket of the five largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. According to Kssis, institutional interest in the BNB ETP has broadly been in line with those of other Amun products that launched this year.      The measures Binance takes periodically to reduce the supply of BNB are part of what makes it attractive to institutions, said Lanre Jonathan Ige, a researcher at Amun.       “Historically one of BNB's value propositions has been the token burn, where Binance would burn a given amount of BNB equal to 20% of their quarterly profits,” he said.      BNB holders also get discounts and special privileges, such as participation in token sales on Binance’s Launchpad platform. Debuting in 2017, the token surged in price this year to an all-time high of $38, though it’s since slid down into the mid-teens.       New BNB-integrated products and services, such as margin trading, lending, and derivatives, could become another key value proposition should they gain and hold market share, said Ige.      In an investment thesis published at the ETP’s launch, Amun argued Binance Coin was “in a prime position to be one of the best performing large cap crypto assets of the next twelve months.”    Alt season?    Supporting the idea that well-heeled investors are starting to sniff around cryptos other than bitcoin, Grayscale Investments’s Q3 report showed that inflows into its non-bitcoin trusts increased sharply, with nearly 80 percent coming from institutions. Out of the total $104.4 million invested into non-Bitcoin products, $83.1 million had been in the last quarter.       But some are not convinced institutional investors favor so-called altcoins. Mati Greenspan, founder of research firm Quantum Economics, said there is little appetite for additional investment into any cryptocurrencies.      “What seems most likely to me, and of course will be very difficult to prove, is that some of the miners who had been stashing bitcoin during the bull run are releasing additional supply on the market,” he wrote in an email brief Monday.      This added selling pressure on bitcoin, which Greenspan believes caused the 10 percent fall over the weekend, will likely prevent traders from moving into other digital assets, at the risk of taking a loss from liquidating their BTC. The lack of short selling this week suggests many traders are unwilling to speculate about future prices and will hold BTC unless something fundamental changes, he told CoinDesk.      Historically, developments have increased interest in BNB. David Thomas, director at the London-based crypto brokerage firm GlobalBlock, said clients had enquired about purchasing BNB following the launch of the Binance.US platform back in September.      But that can cut both ways. Last month, crypto news outlet The Block reported that authorities in China had paid a visit to Binance’s Shanghai office amid a broader clampdown on the crypto sector by the government. While the initial characterization of the event as a “police raid” appears to have been overblown, and Binance itself insisted it never had an office there, the report alone may have been enough to discourage investment.       The added selling pressure from miners flooding the market with bitcoin may mean some institutional investors sit on their hands until conditions improve.      Again, there’s a difference between expressing interest in an asset and actually investing in it. Amun hopes its meetings with potential clients will convert into orders.",POSITIVE,BTC | BNB,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/03/institutions-are-showing-interest-in-etp-tied-to-binance-coin-amun-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d66803716e21776fec91d738a2562f0cb477e4bb-1024x939.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Taking over from Robert A. Cohen, who left the post for a position in the private sector in August, Kristina Littman will be the agency's new chief of the Division of Enforcement’s Cyber Unit, according to an SEC announcement on Monday.      Joining the SEC as a staff attorney in 2010, Littman rose in the ranks to become a senior advisor to SEC Chairman Jay Clayton in the summer of 2017. In that role, she has advised Clayton on regulatory and policy relating to cryptocurrencies and digital assets, as well as international affairs, trading and markets, the SEC said.      “Kristy’s innovative thinking and extensive experience within the Commission have made her an invaluable advisor and, most importantly, a tireless defender of America’s investors,” said Clayton. “She will be an excellent leader for the Cyber Unit as it continues its work in this critical and continually evolving area.”      The Cyber Unit was founded in 2017 as a way to tackle cybersecurity issues and protect investors against wayward members of the developing blockchain and crypto industry.      Under Robert Cohen, the unit pursued actions against initial coin offerings the agency considered fraudulent. Littman will inherit notable ongoing crypto lawsuits, including one against Kik Interactive for allegedly engaging in an unregistered $100-million securities offering. Telegram is also fighting a similar SEC-brought case over its gram token.

42383069,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9trS9,1575363600,"Sanctions Weren't Discussed at North Korea Crypto Conference, Attendee Says","An Italian citizen who attended the North Korean cryptocurrency conference in April says the U.S. government’s charges against his friend and ethereum developer Virgil Griffith are overblown.      Griffith has been charged under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act for allegedly providing technological training that would make it easier for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to evade U.S. economic sanctions. He is in federal custody for providing ""highly technical information to North Korea,"" as U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman put it in last week’s announcement.      But Fabio Pietrosanti says law enforcement has an exaggerated conception of what took place at the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference. Very little of substance transpired, he told CoinDesk.      ""The sanctions were not a topic at all,” said Pietrosanti, who attended the event on the same trip as Griffith, the Ethereum Foundation staffer arrested by the FBI on Thanksgiving Day.    According to Pietrosanti, the conference took up two days of a larger trip that allowed a small group of non-North Koreans to have a look at the so-called ""hermit kingdom."" The visit's full itinerary can be viewed on the state websitehttps://korea-dpr.info/dprk-blockchain-conference-2019.html.    ""I always wanted to go there, in North Korea,"" Pietrosanti told CoinDesk. As a sanctioned country, the place inspires a lot of curiosity for anti-censorship activists like him. ""As you always want to fight against control, it's very interesting,” he said.      Pietrosanti said he’s known Griffith for nearly a decade, first meeting as participants in the TOR community developing the open-source anonymized web browser that makes surveillance all but impossible for anyone but state-level actors.      Griffith's attorney, Brian Klein of Baker Marquart, issued a statement after the accused's first court appearance Monday.      ""We are very pleased that today the judge found that Virgil should be released from jail pending trial. We dispute the untested allegations in the criminal complaint,"" Klein told CoinDesk. ""Virgil looks forward to his day in court, when the full story can come out.""    ‘Don’t talk politics’    To be sure, Pietrosanti has an agenda. He made it clear that his goal in speaking was to advocate for Griffith's safe release.      He asserted multiple times that the sanctions were not discussed at the DPRK conference. To speak of them in such a setting would have been ill-advised, Pietroanti said.      The first rule of visiting a regime like North Korea's, he told us, was, ""don't talk about any political topic."" He knew this already but he said it was something the trip's organizers also emphasized.      More broadly, Pietrosanti said that the conference provided a reason for some outsiders to get access to North Korea and see part of the country. ""From a certain perspective, it's sort of like a tourist trip with some educational value,"" he said.      They were in North Korea for a week, Pietrosanti said, with several days of seeing different parts of the country under a strict schedule, continuously with government minders. There were then two days of the conference. Pietrosanti said it cost him approximately $4,400 to go.      He estimated that the conference involved something like 40 to 60 North Koreans and fewer than 10 outsiders, but Pietrosanti emphasized that the event functioned nothing like a western conference would.      ""We didn't have any opportunity to speak individually with a single [North Korean] person at the entire conference,"" he said. Further, the presentations were slow and halting, because the provided translators were not able to translate in real-time.      So, a presenter would speak, the translator would translate and the speaker would continue unless someone didn't understand. Then they would start over.    Sleepy audience    While the initial agenda was completely planned out by the organizers and approved by the government, Pietrosanti said that they didn't actually have enough material approved to cover two days of a conference.      ""The conference program was a bit improvised,"" he said.      For example, he hadn't originally been slated to speak, but he ended up giving a talk about the tokenization of property, even though he doesn't have expertise in that, because the organizers needed to fill the time.      He didn't have a clear sense of the identities of the North Koreans in the room, but based on some of their questions he guessed that maybe four or five were sophisticated about technology. His impression was that most of the people there had simply been told to go.      ""I saw people sleeping during the conference,"" Pietrosanti said.      The conference is scheduled to take place again in 2020, according to its website.      Pietrosanti said he doesn't really remember much about Griffith's presentation. He characterized the conference as ""a boring two days."" The information covered was ""basic Google-level knowledge,"" he said.      ""It's just crazy to think there was some sophisticated technology transfer,"" Pietrosanti said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/03/sanctions-werent-discussed-at-north-korea-crypto-conference-attendee-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/62e29ded4f01b3de213276d2165d74cf73967c70-2560x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The acquisition of Beijing-based DappReview will help the world's leading exchange by volume to further develop its existing dapps and create new blockchain use cases, said Viktor Radchenko, founder at Binance's Trust Wallet.      ""In the near future, Trust Wallet will integrate DappReview APIs to provide easy access to explore new dapps and crypto games, as well as more insight into DeFi [decentralized finance] services, analytics and usage,"" Radchenko said in an interview.

In recent weeks, the exchange vociferously denied reports that it has closed an office in Shanghai and has tamped down rumors that a Beijing office was forthcoming.      Binance declined to disclose the financial terms of the deal or the actual entity that made the acquisition.

""DappReview is building the bridge between protocols with developers and users,"" Niu said.

42383059,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9trGp,1575334068,Ethereum Developer Virgil Griffith to Be Released From Jail Pending Trial,"A judge ruled that the U.S. Department of Justice has enough evidence to move a case against ethereum developer Virgil Griffith to trial.      Griffith, who was arrested in Los Angeles on Thanksgiving Day on charges of conspiracy to assist the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in learning more about cryptocurrency for its own benefit, had a preliminary court hearing Monday to determine whether the DOJ had sufficient evidence to establish probable cause.      The U.S. Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York said Friday that he had been charged with ""violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by traveling to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) in order deliver a presentation and technical advice on using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to evade sanctions.""      According to Friday's complaint, Griffith asked for – and was denied – permission to travel to North Korea in order to give the presentation, titled ""Blockchain and Peace."" Moreover, the complaint said, Griffith subsequently ""began formulating plans to facilitate the exchange of Cryptocurrency-1 between the DPRK and South Korea,"" despite knowing that this would violate U.S. sanctions against the DPRK.      Following the hearing Monday afternoon, Brian Klein of Baker Marquart, who is representing Griffith, said in a statement that the developer will be released from jail after bond is posted.      He added:    ""We are very pleased that today the judge found that Virgil should be released from jail pending trial. We dispute the untested allegations in the criminal complaint. Virgil looks forward to his day in court, when the full story can come out.""    Klein has represented a number of high-profile individuals in the cryptocurrency and cybersecurity worlds, including bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem and security researcher Marcus Hutchins.      Klein negotiated a settlement against Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who sued Shrem in November 2018 alleging he owed them $26 million in bitcoin. Hutchins, who was accused of creating the Kronos malware by U.S. authorities, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a year of supervised release, with the judge in the case recommending he apply for a pardon.      Correction (Dec. 2, 1:02 UTC): After publication of this article, the lawyer representing Griffith added that his client will be held until bond is posted.
