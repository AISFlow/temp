42428901,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLee3h,1524085558,Scam Twitter Profile Impersonates 6 Different Crypto Accounts,"In an egregious example of the ""blue checkmark"" scam infecting crypto-Twitter, a fraudulent account that recently aimed to dupe users of the cryptocurrency Verge moved onto Bitfinex – that is, before going dark completely.  The Next Web reported Wednesday that freelance film producer and director Seif Elsbei's verified Twitter account (@seifsbei), which boasts Twitter's coveted blue checkmark and over 83,000 followers, was posing as the official account of the Verge developers. The cryptocurrency was thrust into the limelight Tuesday with the news that Pornhub would accept it as a payment method.  Verge's real account, @vergecurrency, lacks a verified checkmark, which the hacker behind @seifsbei perhaps saw as an opening. Twitter allows verified users to change the display name of their accounts without risking their verified status, so @seifsbei adopted the display name vergecurreǹcy. They then proceeded to retweet messages from the actual verge account.  Shortly after, @seifsbei moved on to impersonating the exchange Bitfinex under the name Ƀitfinex.  @seifsbei as Bitfinex, 2:11 pm EDT  A Google search for the account indicates that it was impersonating another exchange, Bittrex (as Ƀittrex), prior to posing as either the verge team or Bitfinex.  As The Next Web points out, the account's controller has previously masqueraded as ethereum's founder Vitalik Buterin. Retweets from the @bitcoin account suggest they were also posing as that account as well as that of the Tron project.  Prior to this week, @seifsbei tweeted almost exclusively in Arabic. Elsbei announced on his Facebook page Tuesday that this account had been hacked and that he was working to recover the handle.  After being contacted by CoinDesk, the account removed its banner image and avatar. Its username is now "".""

The funding was revealed in a Form D filing published Tuesday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Per the document, 190 investors took part in the sale, which occurred between January and April of this year. All were accredited investors, according to the filing, and a spokesperson for the startup confirmed the funding amount when reached.  As CoinDesk reported in December, the startup sold $3 million worth of its tokens to venture fund Pantera Capital. The funding went toward the development of Origin's platform, which its founders described as a system for creating decentralized marketplaces.  A public token sale will occur at some point, co-founder Josh Fraser told CoinDesk. And while Fraser could not confirm a timeline for token distribution, he said ""we expect [it] to happen at the same time as the platform launch.""  ""We already have an early proof of concept on testnet, and are still on track to do our mainnet launch in Q3 of this year. ... Development progress is coming along really well,"" Fraser said, adding:  ""For example, we've built out the first working implementation of the ERC 725 identity standard as proposed by Fabian (same guy who came up with ERC 20).

Kraken was one of 13 exchanges that received a letter from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on Tuesday as part of his new inquiry into cryptocurrency exchanges, as previously reported. While most exchanges generally welcomed the inquiry and said they would fill out the attached questionnaire, Kraken took a different tack when reached for comment.  ""Kraken's BitLicense-prompted exit from New York in 2015 pays another dividend today,"" CEO Jesse Powell said via email early Wednesday morning.  Powell made it clear that Kraken does not intend to answer the questionnaire, saying:  ""I realized that we made the wise decision to get the hell out of New York three years ago and that we can dodge this bullet.""  Kraken announced that it would leave the state in 2015 due to the BitLicense, New York's cryptocurrency regulatory framework. In a blog post at the time, the exchange called the law ""a creature so foul, so cruel that not even Kraken possesses the courage or strength to face its nasty, big, pointy teeth.""  Powell wrote Wednesday that Kraken is generally happy to engage with government bodies but criticized the AG's approach, adding: ""Why don't you try extracting this information from those businesses actually operating in your state?""  A spokesperson for the Attorney General's office, who saw Powell's remarks, told CoinDesk via email:  ""Legitimate entities generally like to demonstrate to their investors that their money will be protected. This is basic information that credible platforms should all have on hand.""  While Kraken is not alone in having left New York due to the BitLicense, some state authorities continue to praise the regulations.  ""The regulatory structure that we created for virtual currency has helped our licensed companies attract greater interest from customers, investors, and potential financial services partners,"" New York Department of Financial Services superintendent Maria Vullo said last week.  Yet lawmakers in the state are looking at the question of revising the framework – or doing away with it entirely. Indeed, during a roundtable discussion in February, industry stakeholders blasted the BitLicense, prompting a pledge from the state senators that hosted it to look at how it may be reworked in light of those concerns.

MassRoots  outlined its vision in an annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, adding that it formed a subsidiary – MassRoots Blockchain Technologies – to explore applications of the technology in December. It has engaged software company MEV to work on the development of the applications.  According to the report, the company has moved to sell Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFTs), collecting more than $900,000 between September and January. Of that amount, $250,000 has been invested in the development of ""blockchain-powered features and utilities.""  Founded in 2013, the company's app is somewhat akin to a cannabis-specific Yelp, allowing users to rate cannabis products and strains. The publicly-traded company has had a colorful history, having its app banned from Apple's online store in a move that was later reversed.  MassRoots explained in the report that blockchain could improve the quality of information available to consumers on its platform, among other things.  ""Currently, a number of technology companies are attempting to curate the best information available on cannabis products and strains,"" the document reads. ""However, the number of cannabis product reviews are low, such reviews are often biased and the most commonly reviewed products received greater exposure than the less reviewed products.""  MassRoots went on to explain that the introduction of a token based on the ERC-20 – running on the ethereum network – standard could create a better system, explaining  ""To provide additional information so that cannabis consumers can make better informed purchasing decisions, we plan to utilize digital instruments as a form of reward based currency within the MassRoots platform to encourage high-quality reviews, including reviews of new products, which we believe will also incentivize user-growth and stimulate our platform's overall activity.""  According to the filing, users will be able to earn tokens through writing reviews. Initially, users will only be able to use the tokens to purchase products and services within the MassRoots ecosystem, but the company said other businesses in the industry – such as vaporizer manufacturers – could also use the tokens one day.  However, the annual report also disclosed that the company posted a net loss of $44 million for 2017.  As detailed by The Cannabist, a marijuana-industry news site, MassRoots's report ""provides a portrait of a negative-net-worth company that is burning through cash, missing IRS payments and SEC reporting deadlines, handing out stock-based compensation like candy, and operating with no external sources of liquidity.""

Sindri Thor Stefansson, who is accused of stealing 600 cryptocurrency mining computers across at least four separate incidents between December 2017 and January 2018, allegedly flew to Sweden on a flight with Iceland's prime minister, according to a report from The Guardian published Wednesday.  Police arrested a further 22 individuals as possible accomplices, though it is unclear how many remain in custody.  The heist – which resulted in the theft of an estimated $2 million worth of mining hardware – is the largest in Iceland's history, as previously reported. At the time, officials called it ""a highly organized crime"" that was coordinated ""on a scale unseen before.""  As such, Stefansson likely had help escaping, local police chief Gunnar Schram was quoted as saying. He told reporters that the alleged criminal ""had an accomplice"" to help him leave the low-security prison he was being held in and travel to the airport, located some 60 miles away.  The mining hardware has not yet been recovered, The Guardian further reported. The owners of the machines have offered $60,000 as a reward for anyone who can help locate the machines.  While a warrant is out for Stefansson's arrest in Sweden, his whereabouts are reportedly unknown at this time.

Speaking at the Blockchain Expo in London, Julian Gray, the technology director for BP’s digital innovation organization, voiced a common theme: non-financial enterprises are perhaps more open to open-blockchain innovation than their financial-services counterparts.  Gray said:  “We haven’t done anything with public chains yet. But that doesn’t mean we won’t. We have done proof of concepts using tokens internally, transferring value.”  Inside BP, he said, there’s a lot of education that needs to be done. But there is a handful of people at the company, formerly known as British Petroleum, now who realize that blockchains, even the open kind, are not merely “hacker territory.""  Gray said that while his own innovation department is robustly funded, he is open to working with others that have gone the ICO route.  “Would we partner with people who are doing this stuff? Yes, I think so,"" he said. ""Not right now, but I wouldn’t be surprised if we did.”  The session moderator, Lewis Cohen, a partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells, said it was interesting to hear someone from a company like BP say this.  While the financial services industry has shown a lot of resistance to anything having to do with ICOs or public chains, that’s not the case in the wider enterprise world, Cohen said, where he’s found players are more amenable to the token route to funding innovation.  Gray added,  “This technology is out the gate and it’s clearly going somewhere and at some point we will interact with it.”  Speaking to CoinDesk after the panel, Gray said: “I have been looking at this for a long time and I don’t believe in taking the view that ICOs are terrible, like we have heard from many people.  “However, I would stress that is my view – and not necessarily the view of BP,” he said.

As previously reported  , Wright is being sued by Ira Kleiman, who filed the case in February on behalf of the estate of his brother, the late Dave Kleiman. Dave Kleiman, an author and forensic computer investigator, was previously linked to the development of bitcoin in its earliest days, and later died in 2013 following a battle with MRSA.  Ira Kleiman accused Wright of scheming to ""seize Dave's bitcoins and his rights to certain intellectual property associated with the bitcoin technology,"" and is seeking the roughly 1.1 million bitcoins (worth roughly $8.8 billion as of press time) or its ""fair market value,"" as well as compensation for the IP claims.  In a court filing dated April 16, Wright – who is being represented in the suit by Miami law firm Rivero Mestre LLP – moved to dismiss the complaint. In the motion, Weight argued that Ira Kleiman's claims are without merit and that the plaintiff lacks any standing to file suit, calling the effort an ""attempted shakedown"" based on ""a thin soup of supposition, speculation, conflicting allegations, hearsay and innuendo.""  Kleiman, as Wright claimed, knew nothing of his late brother's activities related to bitcoin until after he had passed away. At that point, Wright claimed, he himself told Ira that his brother ""might have left a legacy in the form of bitcoins and codes on hard drives held by the estate,"" according to the motion to dismiss.  ""No good deed goes unpunished,"" it adds.  Wright went on to claim that, when Ira Kleiman was unable to access his brother's bitcoin holdings, he ""trained his sights on Dr. Wright’s bitcoins"" and ""mined Australian tabloids for the raw materials needed to cook up his stew of contradictory, absurd, and legally insufficient allegations."" Wright does not control the private keys needed to access those funds, the motion goes on to assert.  He also argued that the court lacks jurisdiction over Wright for the alleged activities, noting that an Australian court has already heard the matter and that its decision cannot be considered invalid as the plaintiff argues.  Wright was first identified as bitcoin's pseudonymous creator in 2015 by several news outlets, sparking a wave of controversy that continues to this day. The bitcoin community was largely skeptical regarding the claims, with some alleging that the proof offered is fraudulent. Wright ultimately declared that he would offer no additional proof to back the Satoshi claim.

42428867,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeYLh,1524060042,IBM-Backed Blockchain Trial Takes Aim at Advertising's Middlemen,"Online advertising has long seemed a ripe target for blockchain transformation.  Going back to the early days of bitcoin, technologists imagined that cryptocurrency tips would fund content creators so they wouldn't have to rely on display ads to pay the bills. More recently, marketers have experimented with smart contracts on ethereum to prevent bots from generating fraudulent traffic that bilks advertisers.  Now, a notable partnership involving a blue-chip advertiser and a well-known media brand is testing a private blockchain to see if it can remove some of the adtech intermediaries leeching from their value chain.  Announced today, the ad industry blockchain R&D consortium AdLedger is launching a proof-of-concept with publisher Salon Media and IBM, which is playing a dual role of advertiser and technology provider.  It's the first proof-of-concept from the consortium, which formed last summer with the mission of bringing transparency to the ad supply chain. And, while a trial of a private enterprise blockchain may not seem as radical as bitcoin tipping, it's a shot across the bow of the many middlemen – up to 15 – that take a cut of ad dollars on their way from the advertiser to the publisher right now.  “Basically what we believe is that the existing protocol was built by those middlemen – and was built to enrich them, for lack of a better term,” Christiana Cacciapuoti, AdLedger’s executive director, told CoinDesk.  As an alternative, the trial aims to show how a media campaign can be done fairly and transparently by using a blockchain to track spending from start to finish and reveal which intermediaries are taking out more value than they are putting in.  But, in addition to demonstrating the potential, it's also meant to lay foundations for actual products for the ad industry.  As Cacciapuoti explained:  “We are going to come up with rules and standards around a blockchain application and what that should look like, and get some hands-on experience for our members.""  Those members include well-known ad industry names such as GroupM, IPG Mediabrands, IAB, IBM, iSpot.tv, MAD Network, Publicis Media and TEGNA.  For Salon Media, the trial promises to ""not only help publishers like us regain more control over our inventory but will also illuminate where inefficiencies exist within the long and complex supply chain,"" said Ryan Nathanson, the publisher's chief operating officer, in a statement.  ""The shared ledger on the blockchain will act as a single source of truth creating indisputable transparency for both the brand itself and the publisher which will aid in greater accuracy during reconciliation as well as make advertiser spend much more efficient,"" he added.  Where'd the money go?  The specific problem the partners are tackling is campaign reconciliation – getting everyone on the same page about where advertising dollars are going and avoiding discrepancies.  The UK’s Guardian newspaper exposed the extent of this problem when it bought its own ad inventory using the so-called programmatic process, and then went on to sue Rubicon Project, alleging the online advertising platform had illegally spirited away a large proportion of the spend.  The lawsuit highlighted how little of the money advertisers think is going to premium publishers actually get there; the Guardian measured this at around 20 cents to 30 cents on the dollar.  The industry has become this opaque and convoluted in spite of, if not as a direct result of, tech advancements.  Cacciapuoti, whose day job is vice president of partnerships and platform operations at adtech firm MAD Network, witnessed in her career the rise of ad networks that would buy publishers’ “remnant” inventory, which was then aggregated into packages that included bottom-of-the-barrel sites rather than premium news as promised.  The proposed fix was automation.  In 2010, the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) introduced real-time bidding, which meant looking at essentially a type of customer relationship management software called a supply-side platform (SSP) that connected publishers’ inventory with bidders. On the flipside, the advertiser goes to a demand-side platform (DSP) and broadcasts what they want to buy.  Publishers and ad buyers pay SSPs a fee to be connected to the auction process. But discrepancies abound between the amounts of advertising publishers and advertisers think has been delivered.  Lots of third-party companies have sprouted up within the gaps, matching and verifying, as the system has grown in complexity.  As Cacciapuoti put it:  “The joke is, ‘how many companies does it take to serve an ad on a website?’”  The answer can be as many as 15 middlemen from the advertiser to the publisher, she said. And all of these players are taking something out.  For example, the SSP, which is just one of those intermediaries, takes 30 percent of the publisher’s revenue, right off the bat.  Enter blockchain  AdLedger’s hunch is that a blockchain can expose where all of those cuts are being taken and participants can easily see who is taking out more value than they are putting in, while also providing a golden record of how much advertising is being placed.  If it works as expected, the technology will eliminate an average 10 percent discrepancy rate.  “As an advertiser, we know better than anyone that the current digital advertising system is broken,” said Chad Andrews, global solutions leader of advertising at IBM, explaining its participation in the trial.  “We believe that blockchain can help our advertising dollars go further by eliminating unnecessary intermediaries, and combining disparate sources of data ... [to produce] immediate metrics,” he said.  The trial will also demonstrate how recording impression-level data to a shared ledger can provide an instant view, instead of 24 hours or 48 hours later, which means advertisers can better optimize campaigns.  After the proof-of-concept is complete, the consortium will produce a white paper which will delve into how the technology performed, right down into the weeds of consensus algorithms (AdLedger is using the open-source Hyperledger Fabric, which is based partly on code contributed by IBM), and what should be allowed to be done off-chain versus what has to be done on the blockchain.  Cacciapuoti acknowledged that while blockchain has got some people excited, there's also a degree of “banner blindness” in the industry to yet another buzzword. It’s also a difficult concept to grasp even for B2B players.

As such, while the notice is not a first for the country, it yet again signals the financial regulator's effort to strengthen its scrutiny over cryptocurrency activities in the Philippines.

42428876,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeYjh,1524050950,"Bain, Lightspeed Back First ICO With $133 Million Basis Funding","It turns out investors are interested in central banking alternatives.  Announced Wednesday, Basis (formerly known as Basecoin) has raised $133 million (most of which was reported last week in an SEC filing) in an initial coin offering (ICO), a round that featured an all-star cast of investors originally first revealed by CoinDesk back in October.  But if that funding round sounds big, so too are the project's ambitions with Basis seeking to offer a so-called ""stablecoin,"" or cryptocurrency that would maintain a stable price in what has proven to be one of the world's most volatile markets. As such, Basis's investors include some of the biggest names in crypto – Andreessen Horowitz, Bain Capital Ventures, Lightspeed Ventures, Google Ventures and others.  ""I think we were able to convert a lot of institutions into understanding the full scope of crypto more broadly,"" Nader Al-Naji, the founder of Basis told CoinDesk.  Some of those institutions haven't even ever invested in a crypto token before. For example, Lightspeed Ventures made its first token investment ever with the Basis round.  ""I think the size of the opportunity is unique and the team is a very good fit for the problem,"" partner Adam Goldberg told CoinDesk.  Basis also convinced Bain Capital Ventures, the venture arm of Bain Capital, to make its first investment in tokens. Although, the $95 billion private investment firm has been interested in crypto since it invested in CoinDesk's parent company, Digital Currency Group. Bain Capital Ventures led the round.  Al-Naji said:  ""I think Bain is uniquely positioned in the institutional finance world.""  Bain has supported al-Naji's idea from the very beginning – alongside AngelList's Naval Ravikant, the firm helped Al-Naji put together the project's initial venture round last year.  Stepping back, Basis is built on the idea that, fundamentally, central banks basically know how to keep a currency stable, but they tend to screw it up through human error. So Basis sets out to use the same operations that central banks use, but control them with software, not brains.  Bain's Salil Deshpande makes the argument for Basis in a forthcoming blog post, saying, ""There have been various approaches to solving the price-stability problem … none of which solve for both counterparty risk and volatility at the same time. Because it is hard to do.""  Many other cryptocurrencies assure stability by backing their tokens with actual fiat currency, but this requires users to trust the entities that manage those currencies. Trusting someone else is risk, and crypto promises to create trustless payment systems where that risk isn't inherent.  Basis uses simple supply and demand to manage the price of its currency. When too many people want basis, the protocol increases the supply of the currency. It does the opposite when demand is weak.  All of this is managed by software, not people — who might have ulterior motives or simply bad judgement.  Well-rounded investors  In fact, the pool of investors reflects an intimate familiarity with the behavior of national banks.  In addition to the firms cited above, the round also includes some notable individual investors, such as Stanley Druckenmiller, who is known for watching the behavior of central banks and understanding their decisions alongside economic fundamentals. He worked alongside George Soros when he bet against the Bank of England and won.  Kevin Warsh also joined the round. He served as an economic adviser to President George W. Bush before he was appointed to the Federal Reserve Board, where he served from 2006 to 2011. Warsh served on the Federal Open Market Committee during the 2008 financial crisis that many credit for inspiring the creation of bitcoin. The committee makes, as a group of humans, the same decisions around issuing bonds and retiring them that Basis is designed to make algorithmically.  Valor Capital is an investment group focused on bridging the U.S. and Brazil. This connects Basis to Latin America, where it believes some of the strongest use cases for crypto might be found.  An Alphabet's venture arm, GV, connects Basis to some of the world's best computer programmers. ""That technical pool of talent and experience that GV has is going to be helpful,"" Al-Naji said. GV declined to indicate whether this was its first purchase of a token pre-sale.  Basis will need that technical talent as it builds a set of products that it hopes will build interest and buzz that will lead to regular people using its new currency. Al-Naji said they will accomplish this by building new, compelling products that work with its token, but he declined to describe what these products will be, for competitive reasons.  Still, if the aim is to reach the non-crypto economy, the products will need to fast, light and super easy to use, and all that takes a unique combination of tech skills.  Why Basis?  The idea of breaking into the consumer market was a big part of what enticed Lightspeed to take part.  ""A unit of account that could be leveraged for all crypto projects lets you remove one mental barrier for consumers,"" Goldberg agreed.  But Basis is not even close to the first project targeting that issue. We've recently covered MakerDAO, Tether, Saga, Carbon, Fragments, Stably and more.  Emulating central banks on the blockchain is a problem Al-Naji tinkered with for years. The trouble he found with blockchains is that they don't generally ""know"" what the price of their token is. Mostly, they just log trades.  Then the idea of oracles started to emerge. Oracles are ways to get data about the real world, and the concept is critical to other projects as well, such as Augur. Al-Naji had been working on ways to help bring stability to bitcoin for years, alongside the fellow Princeton students who would become his founding teammates at Basis. Nothing quite did it until he discovered oracles.  ""That was a big breakthrough,"" he said.""Basically I realized you could get the price of the cryptocurrency onto the blockchain, and once you get the price onto the blockchain, the adjustment can be algorithmic.""  As we previously reported, Basis's coin will initially be pegged to the U.S. dollar. When the price goes below the target, the supply will be contracted by selling bonds and burning tokens. When the price goes over the target, basis will redeem bonds with newly generated tokens.  Just in case the protocol needs to expand supply at some point when there are no bonds available to redeem, it will also sell what it calls ""shares."" If there aren't any bonds to redeem when supply needs to expand, holders of shares will get them.  And not to be U.S.-centric,the protocol allows for its users to change its peg. Speaking to Al-Naji, he seems to very much hope it will one day switch to something like a basket of goods and services rather than a fiat currency. Again, government already does this. In the U.S., officials maintain the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to assess what's happening with prices. The CPI is a basket of goods that gives officials a sense of how much a dollar can buy.  It's a simple concept, but as this episode of Planet Money illustrates, determining the CPI is one of the more time consuming, complicated and secretive things the government does.  Basis seems to be determined to find a way to get there, and that's reflected in its name change. As Al-Naji explained:  ""The other big reason why we like 'basis' is we want Basis to be the fundamental unit of account, the basis of all value.""

42428864,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeYHh,1524048305,Cambridge Analytica Planned ICO Before Facebook Controversy: Reports,"Cambridge Analytica, the firm that faced much criticism over its misuse of Facebook user data, had reportedly planned to organize its own initial coin offering (ICO) before the news broke.  According to a Reuters report citing anonymous sources on Thursday, Cambridge Analytica was originally expecting to raise around $30 million via the launch of its own cryptocurrency and had reached out to a firm that advises on how to structure such schemes.  While it remains unclear at the moment whether the ICO will go ahead after the Facebook controversy, the company told Reuters that it currently has plans to develop a blockchain platform that would give users control of their own information.  Another article from the New York Times indicates that the firm's ICO plan started in mid-2017 with the aim of building a system that would secure users' personal data so it could be sold to advertisers.  ""Who knows more about the usage of personal data than Cambridge Analytica?” Brittany Kaiser, a former employee of the firm, was quoted as saying. “So why not build a platform that reconstructs the way that works?”  The reports come as the firm is under international scrutiny over the way it acquired data on possibly as many as 87 million Facebook users. Cambridge Analytica was hired by President Donald Trump's campaign prior to the 2016 election and was also involved in the ""leave"" campaign of the British Brexit referendum in 2016.

42428879,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeYnh,1524045608,Bitcoin Price Defends $8K But Pullback Still in Play,"Bitcoin (BTC) remains on the hunt for a major bullish breakout after bouncing back from an overnight dip.  Prices hit a four-day low of $7,823 yesterday reportedly due to whale dumping over $50 million-worth of the cryptocurrency in one Bitfinex trade. The news that New York's attorney general is taking a closer look at major cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the state may also have dampened the bull mood.  The sudden price drop raised the possibility that the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 had run out of steam.  However, BTC's sharp return from $7,873 to $8,160 this morning established the area around $7,800 as a strong support level and indicates a strong dip-demand mentality in the market. For the second time in the last three days, a dip below the $8,000 mark was quickly undone.  The recovery witnessed this morning adds credence to the bullish moving average studies.  As of writing, BTC is trading at $8,090 on Bitfinex – largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis.  4-hour chart  The bullish crossover between the 50-day moving average (MA) and the 200-day MA favors the bulls. Note that BTC has also cut through the descending trendline.  More importantly, the recovery from the low of $7,823 to $8,168 signals a bearish pattern failure – that is, BTC witnessed a head-and-shoulders breakdown (bearish reversal) yesterday, seemingly signaling the rally from $6,815 had ended, however, there was no bearish follow-through.  The price action indicates that bitcoin could challenge the resistance zone of $8,350–$8,420 seen in the daily chart below.  Daily chart  The descending trendline resistance has sloped lower to $8,350, while the 50-day MA has shifted lower to $8,416.  The 10-day MA continues to slope upwards in favor of the bulls and is currently seen at $7,674.  View  BTC will likely test supply around $8,400 in the next 24 hours. A high volume close (as per UTC) above that level would signal a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  On the downside, $7,870 (today's low) is the key level to watch out for. BTC's failure to defend the key support level could yield a pullback to $7,510 (former resistance turned support).  Only a daily close below the ascending (bullish biased) 10-day MA would indicate the rally from the low of $6,425 has ended.

42428866,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeYNh,1524042026,Huawei Unveils Hyperledger-Powered Blockchain Service Platform,"Telecommunications and smartphone provider Huawei has become the latest tech giant in China to launch a blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) platform.  Announced at Huawei's analyst conference in Shenzhen on Tuesday, the company's new platform, dubbed Blockchain Service, is said to enable companies to develop smart contracts on top of a distributed ledger network for several use-case scenarios.  A member of, and contributor to, the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger Blockchain Consortium since October 2016, Huawei has based the new BaaS solution on Hyperledger Fabric 1.0, according to Hu Ruifeng, a Huawei engineer who also co-authored the project's white paper ahead of the launch.  As reported by CoinDesk, Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 version was first released in July of last year, and marked a key milestone for the open-source software as it progressed towards production-ready status for enterprise application development.  According to the white paper, the BaaS platform currently allows clients to build smart contract applications that focus on supply chain, tokenized securities assets and public services such as ID verification and financial auditing.  The launch marks the latest technological development from Huawei in its push into blockchain technology, and follows recent efforts by Hu and Huawei engineer Zhou Haojun to develop Project Caliper – software designed to test the performance of major blockchains.  Huawei's effort also comes as major internet and technology giants from China are moving into the space with Baidu and Tencent both having launched their own blockchain service platforms recently.

42428881,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeYhh,1524038460,Police Bust Alleged $13 Million Crypto Pyramid Scheme,"Police in China's northwestern city of Xi'An have arrested the founders of a claimed nationwide cryptocurrency pyramid scheme that allegedly amassed 86 million yuan ($13 million) from over 13,000 people.  According to a report from local media source Huashang News, Wednesday, the scheme launched in March 28 this year after months in preparation by a primary suspect who has has the surname Zheng, as well as three other accomplices.  The report cited an investigation from the police who said the scheme used a cryptocurrency called Da Tang Coin (DTC) that is linked to DTC Holding – a firm under the suspect's control and registered in Hong Kong – to allegedly hoax potential members of the pyramid scheme.  In various promotional events in multiple cities in the country, the scheme claimed that new members can make 80,000 yuan (roughly $13,000) per day with an initial investment of $480,000 to purchase the DBTC at $0.50 per token, according to the report.  These promises of high returns stem from both commissions after developing subsidiary networks and potential trading profit once the token was listed on multiple exchanges, the police force said.  To apparently make the project appear more convincing, the report said suspects hired a foreign-looking man to be the chairman of DTC Holding in an effort to build its company image as an international blockchain technology startup.  A search of the company's name leads to various reports published by notable Chinese media. These include a China Daily piece from March 21 in which a man named Evgeny Subbotin, cited as the chairman and general manager of DTC Holding, attended a blockchain event in Xi'An.  The report further said that the company had touted the potential of DBTC, saying it would be listed on several exchanges such as Shangya, U-Coin and ZB.com. Subbotin was also quoted as promising that the token would eventually be adopted in several real-life use cases including retail payments, hospitality, and education.  The Xi'An police force reportedly launched the investigation on April 5 after receiving complaints from residents in the city who had become involved in the scheme.  The news comes a time when China's Ministry of Pubic Security, the agency that supervises the country's police forces, is beefing up efforts to target financial crimes. The ministry said in January that it will continue cracking down on pyramid schemes related to cryptocurrencies.

42428862,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeYDh,1524031242,Riot Blockchain Has Been Subpoenaed By the SEC,"Riot Blockchain, the Nasdaq-listed company that made headlines last year after its pivot to cryptocurrency related services, has received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The disclosure was made in Riot Blockchain's annual report, which was released on April 17. The company said in its filing that the SEC is ""requesting certain information from the Company.""  ""As part of its review of the Company's public filings, the Securities and Exchange Commission...has inquired about certain of the Company's assets' classification as, and amount of, possible Investment Company assets,"" explained elsewhere in its filing, adding: ""The Company intends to fully cooperate with the SEC request.""  That the firm would face a probe from the U.S. securities regulator is perhaps unsurprising, given that the agency indicated in January that it was scrutinizing companies that have pivoted toward blockchain in recent months amid a wave of interest from investors.  ""The SEC is looking closely at the disclosures of public companies that shift their business models to capitalize on the perceived promise of distributed ledger technology and whether the disclosures comply with the securities laws, particularly in the case of an offering,"" SEC chairman Jay Clayton remarked at the time.  Riot Blockchain's stock price soared in December, exceeding $40 per share at one point – as of Tuesday, the stock was trading at $7.30, according to data from Google. The company has also been hit with several investor lawsuits in the wake of that stock price peak.  The subpoena also comes just a week after Riot Blockchain announced its acquisition of a futures brokerage firm on March 31, announcing plans to launch a cryptocurrency and futures exchange in the U.S.  Elsewhere in the report, Riot Blockchain offered new details about a potential delisting from the Nasdaq, a possibility it first disclosed back in January due to its failure to hold an annual meeting (a situation that was later the subject of a CNBC report).

42428865,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeYRh,1524024025,The New Last-Ditch Effort to Unfreeze a $260 Million Ethereum Fortune,"""The least evil.""  That's how one ethereum user described the latest effort to recover $264 million in cryptocurrency lost due to a code fault in a popular ethereum wallet. But while the recovery efforts that have proliferated since the November incident have been so far shunned, a new effort, now documented in code, aims for a simpler and less invasive way to implement the fix.  Stepping back, in November, the code library associated with U.K. startup Parity's multi-sig wallet was deleted by a pseudonymous hacker who ""accidentally"" exploited a function called “self-destruct."" In the fallout, Parity proposed a modification to the ethereum software whereby the self-destruct mechanism would lose its functionality, but the proposal was found to contain significant security risks.  This new proposal, published on April 15 by Parity Technologies communications officer Afri Schoedon, suggests simply restoring the lost wallet library with a version of the code that does not contain a self-destruct function.  Users would be able to regain access to their funds, and on top of that, the new code would protect Parity from similar exploits going forward. As such, the new proposal sends a clear message - when it comes to fund recovery, some developers have no intention of giving up the fight.  “I think simply recovering funds is both more technically sound and more honest than the original proposal to modify the self-destruct opcode,” ethereum core developer Nick Johnson told CoinDesk.  And a number of others agree.  Co-founder of ethereum prediction protocol Augur, Joey Krug, told CoinDesk:  “I do believe it doesn’t make sense to just have all this capital senselessly locked up.""  Case-specific recovery  What seems to be different about this proposal is its limited reach.  Not only is it focused on the Parity software client only, but it's also targeted specifically at only the 513,774.16 ether lost in the November hack. (This provides a contrast to past proposals, which have aimed at fund recovery broadly).  “Speaking personally, I'm in favor of helping people recover lost funds if the cost to do so is low relative to the funds being recovered, the owner is unambiguous, and the funds are definitively locked up,” Johnson said. “I think the case with the Parity multi-sig bug fits all three criteria.”  The other thing EIP-999 seems to have going for it is that it's simple to execute. Instead of trying to rework the whole ethereum virtual machine, the proposal is specific to the frozen Parity wallets.  Schoedon noted that this would be easy to implement, pointing to the pull-request he already submitted to Parity's code base. If accepted, other ethereum clients could simply follow suit.  And Krug, like others, believe this request might actually see enough community support to finally put an end to the Parity fund recovery debate.  Although for some, including Krug, the balance between protecting ethereum users and encouraging good security practices should be taken into account when deciding whether recoveries should happen.  “In my opinion, proposals like these should be accepted provided the code was actually audited,” Krug said, adding:  ""If it wasn’t, the community should be less forgiving.”  Debate continues  But with the broader debate over the recovery of funds due to code vulnerabilities splitting the community for years, some aren't so sure even EIP-999 will settle the mess.  “Allowing case-by-case proposals for mistake reversals is a terrible idea and opens up all kinds of concerns. This would set a terrible and dangerous precedent,” one user wrote on an ethereum forum.  This sentiment seems to be the current majority on social media and GitHub, where many are worried about future corruption and bribery.  Indeed, a Reddit user warned, ""Some unknown amount of developer mindshare will leave ethereum if this happens.”  Wrapping up what he sees as the sentiment among the community, Johnson told CoinDesk, “It seems plain to me based on an informal survey that a large proportion of the community is opposed to the idea. I think it's unlikely this proposal will be implemented.""  Yet, the debates have brought about some sort of silver lining.  After EIP editor Yoichi Hirai stepped down from his role as a result of an eruption of criticism over the frozen fund recovery efforts, the EIP process was streamlined.  Still, Schoedon is aggravated by the opposition, telling CoinDesk:  “Even though I hear the feedback and apply changes to the new proposal, I get the feeling we’re running in circles here.”  Frozen ether coin image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/18/the-new-last-ditch-effort-to-unfreeze-a-260-million-ethereum-fortune,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c68b3c13da225c46309fcbbec5ed337971dd833-1333x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42428871,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeYVh,1524016850,Crypto Startup Files Petition Against India's Central Bank Ban,"An Indian startup planning to launch a crypto exchange has filed a complaint against the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) decision to bar banks from engaging with crypto services.  Kali Digital Ecosystems filed a writ petition with the High Court of Delhi on Tuesday against the RBI, the Ministry of Finance and the Goods and Services Tax Council (GST Council) seeking ""an appropriate writ, order or direction quashing the circular"" which it describes as ""arbitrary and unconstitutional.""  The company initially planned to launch its crypto exchange, CoinRecoil, in August 2018, and said in the petition that it has ""undertaken substantial investment in this regard."" However, the company now says it will be unable to operate due to the restrictions on banking services imposed by the RBI earlier this month, as previously reported.  The petition reads:  ""On account of the Impugned Circular, the Petitioner will not be able to avail banking services to operate the cryptocurrency exchange 'CoinRecoil.' Such banking services are imperative for the business of the Petitioner. Consequently, the business of the Petitioner is stillborn on account of the Impugned Circular.""  Kali Digital Ecosystems specifically states that RBI's move violates the firm's constitutional right to practice any profession, trade or business.  It also argues that RBI's decision constitutes discrimination under the Constitution, because it gives crypto services ""differential treatment"" without justification.  This lack of justification, the company contends, stems from the failure of RBI to adequately define the scope of the term ""cryptocurrency."" Because of this ambiguity, the term has sometimes been wrongly applied to rewards programs, like airline miles.  Likewise, the company adds that the GST Council has created ""uncertainty"" by neglecting to put forth crypto-specific tax laws, and is ""adversely affecting"" its business as a result. It appeals to the court to correct this by directing the Council to ""frame appropriate regulation on cryptocurrencies.""  RBI's circular was preceeded by two warnings on cryptocurrencies, issued in 2013 and 2017 respectively. Despite its strict stance on cryptocurrencies, the Bank revealed in the circular that it is exploring the idea of issuing its own digital currency.
