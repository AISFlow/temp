42424946,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX6Nh,1370378844,BitAngels interview with David Johnston -- The next bitcoin startups,"I recently had the pleasure of sitting down with David Johnston, the executive director of BitAngels, which is a network of investors that was sporadically formed a couple of weeks ago during a San Jose technology conference to create the first ever angel investment network for Bitcoin startups.  David hopped on Skype with me after having just flown into Mountain View, California for the week, where he was staying at an AirBnB location he dubbed the “Zen Pad”.  “AirBnB is part of the share economy,” he stated enthusiastically. “You rent out your place to travelers and they pay you like a hotel. Normally cheaper in my experience and nicer accommodations in good locations. There was a bar of chocolate and bottles of water waiting for me, I'll put it that way. Amazing what the Internet and a free market can come up with – no more barriers we can just talk directly with one another person to person, much like Bitcoin.”  BitAngels began as a small idea – sort of a side bar during the technology conference – that somehow turned into the Project X of startup investment organizations.  “Mike Turpin came up with the name BitAngels and we invited like five people out to lunch, and like 25 people showed up.”  The numbers did keep growing. At the time of this writing BitAngels has over 100 Bitcoin alumni in their group made up of business owners, lawyers, programmers, and more waiting to fund up to six or seven startups in just the next few months. Early Bitcoin startups are set to receive anywhere from $25,000 to a quarter million dollars in funding at the higher levels.  BitAngels has grown so rapidly in just two weeks that they have received over 60 applications at the time of this writing, and most of them are being heavily considered. Not only that, but the group itself has spread to over 20 cities across the world, with many members offering office space in places like San Francisco, New York, and Austin.  David talked in length about some of the interesting startup applications BitAngels has already received and may be announcing funding for shortly.  Bitcoin Transfers Through Social Media – One BTC-based application wants to make it possible for people to send Bitcoin through Facebook, Twitter, and other social media avenues. David says this will likely be one of the first companies they announce funding for, and the idea is incredibly exciting. The easier Bitcoin is to use and transfer, the more legitimate it will become, and the marketplace as a whole will become more stable and steadily profitable. Imagine being able to send BTC to someone as easily as you would a tweet or FB message, that would trump even PayPal transfers.  Better Wallets – One thing about wallets is, if you haven't put in the research, they're kind of confusing. You have web wallets, mobile wallets, software wallets, and paper wallets. Of course, the safest wallet is paper or “cold storage,” which can be a hassle. Software wallets can be hacked, even if they're encrypted – not only that, if your computer crashes, it's the equivalent of your safe disappearing into the proverbial ether (money go bye-bye). Web wallets and mobile wallets are definitely more convenient, but are at a much higher risk of theft and hacking. Any startups that can achieve funding for the development of easier, more secure wallets with a greater mass appeal will definitely help change the landscape and make Bitcoin more accessible to – let's say – your grandmother, or your friend who still doesn't understand what Twitter is. David says he's gotten a lot of applications in this area.  Colored Coins – David talked a lot about colored coins in our interview and for good reason. Many of you reading this right now may not know what colored coins are, so I'll do a little 'splainin' because it's super cool. Originally, bitcoins are fungible and operate as a neutral medium of exchange. However, imagine if you could track the origin of any given BTC and essentially “color” it in order to distinguish it from the rest – kind of like if you had a stack of Benjamins and decided to mark a few of them with a highlighter in order to set them apart (or color a mustache on ol' Franklin). By coloring the coins, they can be provided with special properties by either an issueing agent or a Schelling point, which will give them value independent of the face value of the underlying bitcoins. What does this mean? Well, it means that specifically colored bitcoins can be used for alternative currencies, commodity certificates, smart property, and other financial instruments such as stocks and bonds. Basically, these colored bitcoins can be stored or transferred without the need for a third party and be exchanged for one another in an atomic transaction, which may open the way for decentralized exchanges of things that are not possible by traditional methods. Neat!  Compliant US Exchanges – This is a biggie. David says, “There aren't that many exchanges in the US that have navigated the regulatory problems and regulatory issues around being a money transmitter.” And, right now, we're all currently under the mighty whim of Mt.Gox or one of the other exchanges that, let's face it, are just a nightmare to fund and trade on. With the upcoming new US exchange launching soon, we can not only have a more convenient US alternative to Mt.Gox, but make sure we are completely compliant with the US government, which is a really good thing – it provides more legitimacy to the currency. We want to be friendly with the feds – you know, take them out to dinner, show them a good time, but definitely don't enter into a monogamous financial relationship.  Because BitAngels is made up of a large and growing group of alumni, it is able to provide social capital. As David says, it's costing less money to start businesses now, which makes social capital more and more important. With all of these experienced alumni working together to fund Bitcoin startups, it allows for an amazing amount of room for growth in the overall digital currency economy.  If you think you have the next big idea for a Bitcoin startup head on over to BitAngels.co and submit an application, chances are they'll be happy to hear from you.  Oh, and for those of you wondering whether or not BitAngels is concentrating solely on BTC and completely ignoring alt-currencies – they're not. When asked whether or not they will consider alt-currency startups, David issued an emphatic, “Absolutely” followed by a resounding, “Monopoly is not a healthy thing.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,William McCanless,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/04/bitangels-interview-with-david-johnston-the-next-bitcoin-startups,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b3c3479944725c0a7d8f4df3e1ec80035a344b30-941x355.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424938,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX6Hh,1370378442,CoinMkt exchange to ease alt-currency transfer woes,"If Travis Skweres gets his way, buying bitcoins will be as easy and simple as trading fiat currencies on your bank's website. His exchange, CoinMKT, will be launching in a month, and will offer easier transactions between fiat dollars and alternative currencies.  Skweres, who founded CoinMKT, has worked for the past year as a front-end developer specializing in user interfaces. Before that, he co-founded the now-defunct job-matching site Werkadoo, and the freelance job placement site Adjungo.  With CoinMKT, Skweres hopes to simplify the process of exchanging US dollars for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  ""It's obvious that getting US dollars into the bitcoin market is really hard,"" he says. ""Is an institutional investor going to take $50,000 to Moneygram at the liquor store to send overseas to Mt. Gox?""  ""I remember last year when I first got into this market that it took about five steps to get my money into bitcoin,"" he recalls. He took cash to Moneygram, sent it to a company called ZipZap, through which he had registered a receipt with BitInstant. Finally, he got his money into the incumbent exchange.  He wants to simplify the process by introducing a range of money transfer options that will enable people to get US dollars into his exchange and get access to their bitcoins instantly, he says. He plans to use transfer mechanisms including automated clearinghouse (ACH) services, eCheque, Dwolla and BitInstant.  “If I'm a US customer, I have to do a wire transfer or BitInstant to get USD in there,” he says. “What we really want to do is provide a more seamless experience where the user never has to leave our site, similar to Coinbase. Think: Coinbase's easy bank linking process, but not just bitcoins ... six different cryptocurrencies.”  CoinMKT isn't putting all its eggs in the bitcoin basket. It will be offering a variety of other alt-currencies, namely Litecoin, PPCoin, TerraCoin, NovaCoin and NameCoin. No sign of FeatherCoin, the widely regarded second runner to Litecoin, or the demurrage-based, SHA-256-based Friecoin, as yet.  ""No one really knows what the final cryptocurrency is that will go mainstream,"" concludes Skweres. ""When we started CoinMKT, what we basically said was that we don't want to take a particular one. We want to support them all and allow customers to choose the ones that they do business in.""  Having watched Mt. Gox get burned by the Department of Homeland Security, he is taking extra care with compliance. He aims to be a fully registered money transmitter business by the time he launches (on July 1, he hopes). He may make some ""play trading"" accounts available in late June.  ""We are striking deals with money transmitter businesses and companies that have licenses so that we can use their licenses and do money flows through them as well as applying for our own licenses,"" he says. He wants to be ready before the regulators come knocking. ""Internally we are calling it ‘pre-compliance’.""  Other companies, such as California-based Tradehill, identify banks as partners who can help new exchanges by providing money transmitting business licenses to do business in a particular region. Skweres is looking at other types of partners to help him achieve compliance across the US.  ""A lot of the money transmitter laws were aimed at prepaid card services in the '90s,"" he says. ""I was talking to a potential partner who said that all of the Bitcoin companies are complaining about this regulation. He was saying 'I have been dealing with this for 10 years'.""  Still, Skweres faces some challenges with CoinMKT. The exchange is bootstrapped as of today, with no external funding. And yet he aims to have enough liquidity to eventually satisfy trades on his own without having to trade via other exchanges. ""This will give us the advantage of instant settlement,"" he explains.  ""We want to be the Mt. Gox for the US,"" he says. ""A lot of our competitors that accept US dollars for bitcoin will accept your dollars, trade them on another exchange, buy your coins, and pull them in.""  The danger here is that an exchange can hit a threshold with another exchange, making it difficult for them to trade any more with that exchange for the rest of the day and limiting their ability to deliver fast trades to customers. ""We want to build a local market here in the US that has the coins, so that when you click 'buy', you get them straight away.""  However, that means having enough bitcoins to satisfy all of the trades on its order book.  ""We are in talks with investors and partners,"" he says. ""It will be a tough one but we think we can pull it off.""  In the meantime, he adds, he will be able to resort to trading on other exchanges if necessary.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/04/coinmkt-exchange-to-ease-alt-currency-transfer-woes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09f87d072327caa3962af03eaa19c565b6dc5483-628x356.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Gox bitcoin exchange will stop allowing funds and withdrawals through the Australian Technocash service, which was recently linked to the $6 billion money-laundering case involving Liberty Reserve.  In a statement released today, Mt. Gox noted it made its decision ""after some deliberation and discussion with Technocash.""  ""We are working on alternatives for our Australian customers, but in the meantime please use other available methods such as international wire transfers, which are available in your customer accounts,"" the statement from Mt. Gox went on to say. ""Withdrawals via Technocash will be processed as long as we possibly can, and we will make our best effort to keep this method available.""  In its indictment against Liberty Reserve and the company's principles, handed down last week, the US federal government identified a number of financial institutions believed to be holding a portion of the $6 billion connected to money laundering charges. They included three accounts at Australia's Westpac Bank held in the name of Technocash Ltd.  The three Technocash accounts reportedly held nearly $37 million on deposit.  The US indictment also sought forfeitures from bank accounts in Costa Rica, Cyprus, Russia, China, Morocco, Spain and Latvia.  Speaking to The Australian this week, Technocash managing director Paul Monsted said the company's appearance in the US indictment was ""distressing"" and ""a bit of a hit.""  In a press release issued last week, Technocash stated the following:    ""Technocash wishes to make clear that it:      ""Technocash has been assisting authorities in their investigations of the matters raised in the abovementioned article and is committed to continuing its compliance with the requirements of the anti money laundering and compliance legislation in all jurisdictions in which it operates.  is a B2B global multi-currency payment system, that offers its business customers a platform to receive, hold and pay in most major international currencies;  does not have accounts in the name of Liberty Reserve;  is, and always has, fully complied with Australia’s anti money laundering and compliance regimes, including Austrac reporting; and  does not have any anonymous transactions or unverified customers.

42424937,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX2Zh,1370350835,US Federal Reserve investigating online banking potential risks,"The United States Federal Reserve is studying the impact of online payment options such as PayPal and Bitcoin to determine potential risks associated with them. The Bitcoin community is apprehensive following recent comments of Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen, who said, “We have been talking at the Fed and with banking organizations, trying to more carefully understand what the concerns are with these new payment mechanisms”.  While that comment was made in response to a question regarding regulatory scrutiny over online payment providers such as PayPal, Bitcoin users are fearful, keeping the recent shutdown of Liberty Reserve, a virtual currency site, and the seizure of an account belonging to Mt. Gox, a digital currency exchange operator, in mind.  Yellen’s comment follows a recent US Treasury Department ruling which states that online banking providers are subject to the same money-laundering rules and regulations as traditional banks and banking institutions. These rules apply to Bitcoin and other digital currencies, even if they are not under the governorship of a central bank, or indeed a central company or government.  The chief fear of banking officials appears to be that virtual currencies may be used by criminals or terrorists for money-laundering purposes, or by multinational companies to transfer money without tax repercussions. As Bitcoin is one of the fastest growing alternative currencies, it is coming under increasing scrutiny.  It is unclear yet what the ultimate attitude of the Federal Reserve will be in regard to Bitcoin and other online payment options. However, according to Yellen, “This (concerns over new online payment mechanisms) is very much on our radar screen and we are carefully trying to identify where the risks are”.

42395336,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASkVDX,1370339865,Fixing Bitcoin's shaky exchange infrastructure,"September 14th will be a big day for Jered Kenna. The former Marine knows a thing or two about hard sprints, which is exactly what he's facing this summer.  Kenna is CEO of Tradehill, a bitcoin exchange focusing on high net worth individuals. Based in California, it calls itself the ""single most secure and reliable major bitcoin exchange platform"". It has never been hacked, it says. Indeed, the site, which launched on March 18th, hired tech staff from Google and Cloudflare (which specialises in mitigating DDoS attacks). When you're dealing with professional investors, you don't want to make any mistakes moving their money around.  But Tradehill faces other challenges. On the day it launched, US financial regulator FinCEN released its regulation on virtual currencies, confirming that anyone selling units of a decentralised virtual currency to another person for real currency or its equivalent is a money transmitter.  That means bitcoin exchanges like Tradehill would have to register as a money transmitter with the federal government. That is the easy part, says Kenna, requiring little more than a single page form. The hard part is getting the relevant licence in each US state. They all have different rules, and some (sources single out New York and California) are particularly difficult.  Time (at least a little of it) is on Tradehill's side, however. Even though the FinCEN guidance came into immediate effect, it only applies to businesses 180 days after they begin trading in bitcoin. This gives it until mid-September to get its paperwork in order.  Not all exchanges have been as rigorous as Tradehill, however. Many have fallen, suffering closure due to regulatory squabbles, or technological failures. Indeed, researchers at Southern Methodist University and Carnegie Mellon found that 45% of bitcoin exchanges established over a three-year period closed. Even more alarming is the customer redemption rate: half of those exchanges failed to return customers' funds. Just how stable is the community of bitcoin exchanges?  “Nearly half of the exchanges that we recorded being operational later decided that they wanted to close for one reason or another,” says Tyler Moore, assistant professor of computer science at Southern Methodist University, and co-author of a study called Beware the Middleman: Empirical Analysis of Bitcoin-Exchange Risk. “It could be because they were not a good business opportunity, or they ran out of the funds or they scammed their customers.”  Regulatory hassles are a huge problem, which is why Kenna is taking such care over his own legal position.  ""Treat bitcoin like the bank would treat cash,"" he advises, when describing what makes a good exchange. The problem is, many exchanges don't. ""A lot of bitcoin exchanges completely lie to the banks, and they don't tell the banks that they are a money service business, or exactly what they do. And when the bank finds out, that's the end of the relationship,"" he warns.  Several exchanges have been forced to shut down after having their bank accounts pulled in recent months. Bitfloor shutdown in April after its bank account was closed without its consent. Bitcoin-24, which was for a while one of the largest European exchanges, closed its doors after its Polish and German bankers pulled its accounts, apparently at the behest of law enforcement. At the time of writing, the German seizure had been lifted, although Poland was still locked down.  Other exchanges have also been hit by regulators. Mt. Gox had its US assets seized by the Department of Homeland Security, after it emerged that the Japan-based exchange was not registered in the country as a money transmitter. But Mt. Gox has survived the onslaught, and still controls the lion's share of bitcoin trades.  Competition and diversity are indicators of a successful and evolving ecosystem, whereas monocultures rarely flourish. It could be that a more diverse exchange landscape would nourish Bitcoin and other altcurrencies - but as charts show, volume distribution between different exchanges is far from equal.  ""It's hard to get money in and out of Mt. Gox,"" complains Jesse Heaslip, co-founder of Bex.io, a Vancouver-based start-up that will launch a cloud-based 'roll your own' exchange platform this summer. He says that he formed his company because the market needed viable alternatives but that it can be hard to get critical mass as an exchange. ""The real issue comes down to liquidity,"" he says. ""The reason that Mt. Gox is Mt. Gox is because it has the capability to fulfil orders quickly.""  Liquidity – the ability to fulfil orders quickly - is a crucial factor in trading volume. Trading volume is a key characteristic for a successful exchange, says Moore. ""One key finding from the paper is that the trading volume that the exchange was able to sustain impacts whether or not it will close,"" he says. ""Higher volume exchanges are more likely to stay open and not shut down.""  Liquidity has certainly been a problem for others in the past. Australian exchange Bit Innovate was unable to meet its trading commitments during the notorious April trading spike, because it didn't have enough bitcoins to go around.  ""We are going after the liquidity problem,"" says Bex.io’s Heaslip. ""Our goal is to link together exchanges and create a bigger pool of liquidity."" A cross-filling mechanism on Bex.io will enable customers to fill orders between their exchanges quickly, to avoid them running out of coins.  There’s a trade-off between volume and security, says Moore. Trading volume may help to cement an exchange’s position and keep it alive, but the SMU/CM study found that exchanges with a higher trading volume were more likely to suffer a security breach, presumably because hackers are drawn to exchanges with bigger wallets.  DDoS attacks are rife in the cryptocurrency world, and several exchanges have been hacked, including Mt. Gox. Nevertheless, all of this leaves Mt. Gox as the incumbent exchange, with a handful of other relatively large players, and then a whole shoal of very small fish.  Some of these small fish swim quickly, though, and have innovative business models that stop them needing to handle bitcoin-to-fiat transfers at all. Instead, they let their users do it and just act as escrow services.  One of them is localbitcoins.com, which is designed for bitcoin-to-fiat currency trades on a local basis. As Jeremias Kangas, the founder of the site, explains, 'local' is now open to interpretation.  Users of the site with registered accounts can make a request to buy or sell bitcoins for fiat currency. They can either meet in person to complete a payment, or they can make the fiat exchange via a banking system.  ""At first, we were only a local cash exchange, but then people wanted to trade online,"" Kangas explains. So, he introduced support for other payment mechanisms. These include PayPal or a mutually accepted banking system, turning localbitcoins.com into a physical or Internet-based, person to-person trading mechanism.  The system uses an escrow account to hold bitcoins, and enables the sender of bitcoins to release them when the fiat payment has been received. Bitcoins must already be stored in a sender’s localbitcoins.com wallet before they can be sold, and bitcoin sellers gain a higher reputation score each time they successfully make a trade. The number of bitcoins that can be sold is linked to that score.  ""I am enabling trades between users that cannot be closed down,"" explains Kangas. ""We don't rely on any bank accounts.""  However, there are potential drawbacks, as Kangas points out on the site. Transactions via transfer mechanisms such as PayPal can easily be revoked, opening up bitcoin sellers to fraud.  Nevertheless, there is clearly a demand for this. The site is currently trading at a volume of 800 bitcoins per day, and takes 1% from every escrow transaction. It has users from 500 cities in 140 countries. On the day that he spoke to Point desk, Candice took on 250 additional users, showing how quickly the site is gaining traction.  ""The advantage to end users is speed, and less paperwork bureaucracy,"" he says. ""You can create an account instantly, and if you find a trader, you can trade immediately with them.""  Others are attempting to formalise this exchangeless decentralisation, introducing proprietary technologies to reduce the fraud risk. MetaLair, a group of techies from Sussex, UK, is still working on its peer-to-peer decentralised crypto currency exchange, which relies on open source client software. In its mechanism, a multi-signature transaction is used with an escrow party, which monitors the transaction and releases the funds when the other parties to the transaction fulfil their responsibilities. The parties to the transaction can choose how many third parties they would like to confirm that the transaction has taken place.  The company is still working on the system, and may well launch an automated escrow service that only supports transactions between crypto currencies to begin with. If this happens, it will potentially extend to exchanges between crypto currencies and fiat currencies later.  However these decentralised 'exchangeless exchanges' fare, there is a need to make exchanges more geographically diverse, says MetaLair’s co-founder Jonathan Turrall. “We’re all aware of the problems with the Argentinian financial system,” he says.  Argentina has been rocked by a series of currency crises, and has seen its inflation rate rise to around 25%, as leaders have pledged not to devalue it. The country has been using capital controls to throttle an exit from the peso. No wonder that advocates are making movies about the Bitcoin in Argentina, and that Tradehill is said to be planning an office there.  “If we could get better representation of these exchanges in these territories it would start to benefit bitcoin and its users,” asserts Turrall.  As things stand, though, the US dollar still represents the lion’s share of trades, at 79% (with the Euro and the Chinese Yuan coming a distant second and third, respectively). And in volume terms, Mt Gox’s USD exchange is still the clear winner. But things may be gradually changing.  This chart shows the trading volumes of the largest three USD exchanges – Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, and BCT-E, over the last six months. Each data point represents the weekly average trading volume for each exchange, as a percentage of the three (1 = 100%). Mt. Gox has been losing ground in the last month after a mostly steady run. Could it be a blip, or could it be an erosion of trust after Mt. Gox’s recent travails with the US government?

They have no value because anyone can create more.  We've all heard our share of Bitcoin baloney. True, while there are some dark sides to this cryptocurrency — the enormous cost of mining bitcoins, the inability to recover lost coins, wallet vulnerabilities, to name a few — there's plenty of misinformation being spread around.  ""People aren't taking the time to do their research, and there is a learning curve,"" said Alan Silbert, founder and CEO of BitPremier, a luxury marketplace dealing only in bitcoin. ""Drug dealers have gotten a lot of focus but it's tainting Bitcoin in general.""  In April, Dawid Ciężarkiewicz gave a presentation in Toruń, Poland, that delved into common myths surrounding Bitcoin. One of the most pervasive falsehoods he has encountered is that bitcoins ""are given out for free,"" he said. Furthermore, ""many people claim that bitcoins have been hacked while it's not true.""  Naysayers be damned. We decided to tackle the issue by exploring (and debunking) 10 myths surrounding bitcoin.  1. Bitcoins have no intrinsic value  It's heavily debated whether bitcoins have intrinsic value outside of their use as a medium of exchange. Sure, if society came to a screeching halt, the decentralized currency not backed by the government or pegged to any commodity likely won't have any value. But there are also arguments to be made about the value of Bitcoin as a global network of exchanges and merchants. At the end of the day, value is determined by supply and demand. If usage grows and this currency becomes a mainstay, then its value will increase as well.  2. Bitcoins are illegal because they're not legal tender  Another big question surrounding Bitcoin is whether it's a form of legal tender. In the US, legal tender comprises coins and bills that have been minted and issued by the US government. But that's not to say that bitcoins are illegal, because the US government classifies it as a virtual currency ... something that the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) actually recognizes. For now, Bitcoin might fall into some gray areas, but it's definitely not illegal.  3. Bitcoins are used primarily to launder money  ""If you look at the market cap of Bitcoin, that (would be) an awful lot of illicit activities,"" said bitcoin user Jason Williams. ""The Silk Road demonstrates there is a market but, then again, so does the drug dealer on the corner accepting cash.""  Silbert of BitPremier weighed in by saying ""the Bitcoin community wants to adhere to the rules,"" and is willing to cooperate with governments to increase the crytocurrency's adoption. ""To paint them with this wide brush of money-laundering anarchists is not fair."" Besides, the US dollar is the preferred way to launder money, he noted.  4. Bitcoin enables tax evasion  The argument here by Bitcoin backers is that cash transactions are likewise anonymous but still taxed successfully. It's a weak premise to say that tax evaders will be caught because their lifestyles and assets are inconsistent with reported income, but when you think about it, that's how the feds took down Al Capone.  5. Bitcoins are given away for free  Dawid Ciężarkiewicz said not understanding the mining process leads many people to think bitcoins are given away for free. In fact, bitcoins are mined in a computing resource-intensive process that validates transitions by solving a series of cryptographic puzzles.  Bitcoins are validated through blockchains, which are ledgers of past transactions. Miners who process and verify Bitcoin transactions are rewarded with bitcoins, as well as with fees others pay. Like the saying goes, it costs money to make money and, to date, mining bitcoins has cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. This design is intentional: the difficulty of mining is built in to limit the number of bitcoins found each day. In addition, there's a hard limit on the number of bitcoins that can be mined: 21 million coins, which is expected to be reached by 2140.  6. Point of sale with bitcoins isn't possible  It can take upwards of an hour to confirm transactions and ensure coins aren't spent twice. Silbert's e-commerce venture BitPremier is a luxury marketplace that brokers products such as yachts, sports cars and jewelry. Because the company deals exclusively in high-end items paid for via bitcoins, ""people don't mind waiting for an hour,"" he said.  ""I could see for low-ticket items how this could be problematic,"" he noted. ""I think the risk of double-spending is pretty low. For small point of sales, such as a cup of coffee or yogurt, it doesn't behoove the vendor to have people wait around for confirmation. If it's just one out of 100 people committing double-spending, which I think is highly unlikely, have them pay and let them be on their way."" Vendors are also able to accept unconfirmed transactions by listening on the network or using a company to avoid double-spend transactions, a process that takes mere seconds.  With new headlines every day about yet another business accepting bitcoins, vendors clearly haven't been scared off.  7. It's a giant Ponzi scheme  This is an easy one. A Ponzi scheme is defined as a form of fraud that pays investors returns with money from later investors instead of with money from profits. Because Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer, open-source currency, there's no central entity to lead such a scheme. While early adopters have enjoyed huge surges, they're not profiting at the expense of those hopping on the bandwagon later.  8. Quantum computers would break Bitcoin's security  The operative word here is would. True, quantum computers pose a risk for the bitcoin network as well as for any institutions -- including banks -- that rely on cryptography. But there's one little caveat: Quantum computers don't exist yet.  9. No one will generate new blocks after 21 million bitcoins have been mined  After 21 million bitcoins have been mined, no more can be generated, but the network will still need to be secured. Incentive for mining might diminish, but the generation of new blocks is important to provide the publicly available, network-distributed ledger of transactions. Miners will still be able to turn a profit from transaction fees.  Still, one notable effect posed by some is that once the mining reward has been reduced (or no longer exists), so will the demand for security.  Over at StackExchange, eldentyrell has pondered about what will happen to the network's security after 21 million coins have been mined.    It isn't perfect, but the important point is that the demand for security increases the incentive to mine …      As the mining reward is reduced this ""direct coupling"" between the network's need for security and the incentive to mine becomes progressively more diluted.    I worry a lot about what will happen to Bitcoin once we decouple those two forces. I think the developers ought to at least come up with a story on how this will be solved so people can start testing it.    10. Bitcoin has been hacked  This is one of the most prevalent myths Bitcoiners have to defend against. Is anybody's money secure if the network can be hacked?  So far, Bitcoin vulnerabilities have included inadequate wallet security and attacks on websites that use bitcoins. But to date, there haven't been attacks on blockchains that led to stolen money, heists from exploiting the protocol or thefts due to holes with the original Bitcoin client.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Alice Truong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2013/06/04/top-10-bitcoin-myths-debunked,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23e84d20881391175e4e889b797e5c140b3bb476-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
