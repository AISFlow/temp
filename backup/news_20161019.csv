42399413,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj710,1476911929,European Insurance Firms Launch New Blockchain Consortium,"Five major European insurance and reinsurance companies have partnered on a new blockchain initiative, seeking a potential new path for delivering faster and secure client services.  The project  , dubbed the Blockchain Insurance Industry Initiative, or B3i, is aimed at providing a meeting ground for the companies to exchange ideas, test use cases and pursue concepts that could ultimately reshape how they deliver insurance services. The firms taking part are Allianz, Aegon, Munich Re, Swiss Re and Zurich, constituting some of the biggest companies of their kind in the region.  The group is the latest enterprise-driven consortium to emerge, following in the footsteps of initiatives like R3 and the Post-Trade Distributed Ledger Group.  Those backing the B3i effort say that it could ultimately lead to new ways of doing business. Mark Bloom, Aegon’s chief technology officer, said in a statement:  “We want to be at the heart of these developments and see Blockchain as one of those potential catalysts for change. By actively creating partnerships and making strategic investments we can build smarter solutions together with our clients.""  For Allianz – which has explored applications for the exchange of catastrophe bonds and has worked with startups in the space through its fintech accelerator – the technology offers a means to increase transparency for its customers.  “This initiative, enabling alternative operating models based on the Blockchain technology, can help us increase transparency and efficiency and deliver a better experience to our customer,” Allianz Group COO Christof Mascher said in a statement.  The companies involved said they hope other firms in the insurance and reinsurance industries join the initiative. The goal, according to statements, is to advance use cases “across the entire insurance value chain”.

42399402,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj6u7,1476905423,Ethereum Forks But Blockchain Attacks Keep On Coming,"Between a block and a hard place?  While ethereum's latest hard fork went according to plan yesterday (so far without any drastic side effects), attacks on its blockchain quickly began anew.  In this case, ethereum executed a hard fork on Tuesday in a bid to stop denial of service (DoS) attacks that have been ongoing for about a month. Following weeks of transaction and block creation issues, the platform's developers determined that the best way to fix the issue was to reprice certain network functions, and users and miners responded by quickly upgrading their software (a process known as a 'hard fork').  The stable transition to a new transaction record was what many in ethereum team arguably had expected, since the fork was a technical change (unlike the contentious move to rewrite the network's ledger after the hack of The DAO).  However, the attacker appears to have switched gears, taking advantage of security holes that weren't expected to be patched until later.  Developers are currently working on new fixes, according to Ethereum Foundation IT consultant Hudson Jameson, who told CoinDesk:  ""We are working on client updates to help mitigate the issues somewhat until the second hard fork happens.""  Not yet thwarted  But this new wave of attacks has led to new problems, though they were (to an extent) forseen.  From the start, ethereum developers had planned two hard forks, as the attacker had been taking advantage of a variety of attack vectors. The first aimed to increase the price of certain opcodes that the attacker was successfully abusing to make it harder for him or her to slow down the network. The second hard fork was expected to remove empty accounts the attacker created to bloat the blockchain.  Still, with the second fork yet to be executed, short-term problems have emerged.  In response to the most recent attacks, the Ethereum Foundation issued a recommendation to miners, advising them to lower the gas limit (thus limiting how many transactions can be carried out) before a second fork. At the time of press, cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift has also paused the trading of ether (again).  Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin suggested he believes the two attacks can be thwarted with the second technical upgrade. ""A successful hard fork round two would resolve this for the short and medium term as it would make the state possible to put in memory again,"" he explained.  The problem, Jameson said, is that the blockchain state has grown too big, and the attacker is taking advantage of that.  ""The [second] hard fork will shrink the size of the blockchain state and disallow a specific attack that is being utilized to activate the empty accounts over and over again,"" he explained.  One less severe attack, which increases processing times to an estimated one to three seconds, takes advantage of another mispriced opcode.  Johnson and Buterin claimed that the plan is to raise the price in the second hard fork.  Conditions ahead  Even after the second hard fork, however, it's unclear what will happen or whether it will prevent attackers from finding other vectors.  Around these attacks there have been wider conversations about how (and whether) ethereum can stop these sorts of attacks in the short term or long term.  Many argue that the attacks are an inevitable result of the way ethereum is designed. (More on-platform capabilities mean that ethereum has a larger attack surface than other blockchain networks).  The new attacks prompted BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp to wonder ""how many hard forks it will take to plug all the holes"".  And some observers are questioning whether developers are taking enough care before making changes to the network.  ""The real story behind this attack and the hardforks is that they are not really testing well,"" said IBM blockchain leader of the Latin American division Martin Hagelstrom. ""Even when the devs talk about these issues it does not sound like they are aware that their network has $1bn in it.""  But others remain optimistic about ethereum's future, especially since there haven't appeared to be any serious problems so far as a result of the fork.  Even if the attacker isn't thwarted this time, to some this only furthers idea that hard forks are an option for combating them, and that each hurdle that ethereum jumps brings it closer to a working platform.  Marco Streng, CEO of hosted ethereum mining firm, Genesis Mining, indicated he remains impressed by the network's response to the pressures it has faced in recent months.  Streng concluded:  ""It sets a clear sign ethereum will go out of this stronger than before.""

MUFG is conducting the test through a subsidiary called Kabu.com Securities Co, at which employees will be awarded a blockchain-based currency called “OOIRI” in return for maintaining good health. Details posted on the Kabu.com website indicate that the project involves representatives from both that firm as well as MUFG’s innovation unit.  The OOIRI currency is said to be tied to the value of the yen and will available for spending at local businesses through an app called Z-Wallet, developed by an Israeli startup called Zerobillbank. Further, health data will be drawn in part through the use of geolocational software that is integrated in the wallet.  MUFG  , primarily through the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, has pursued blockchain applications in the areas of financial management and digital cash. MUFG is also an investor in San Francisco-based digital asset exchange Coinbase.  If successful, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ will reportedly look to introduce a system similar to the OOIRI reward currency.

42399429,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj6s9,1476885263,US Elections Watchdog Might Change Bitcoin Rules,"Amidst the backdrop of a chaotic presidential election between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, the US Federal Election Commission is quietly debating whether to reclassify how it treats bitcoin donations.  In May 2014, the FEC greenlit bitcoin donations to political campaigns, classifying them as an “in-kind” contribution in response to a request by a Make Your Laws PAC, a North Carolina organization. At the time, the agency put a cap of $100 per contributor, an amount that corresponds to whatever the current market price is at the time of the donation.  By ruling that bitcoin donations are in-kind contributions, the FEC placed the digital currency in the same category of stocks or other kinds of valuable assets. This was largely driven by the fact that bitcoins can’t be deposited into a bank account. Instead, a campaign can hold on to any bitcoins received until it decide to sell them, at which time a 10-day deadline for depositing the funds kicks in.  Public records, however, show that the FEC is rethinking this approach, at least in part.  According to a draft agenda from 15th September, the FEC is in the earliest stages of considering whether to continue that “in-kind” classification or align the digital currency with its rules on cash.  The agency wrote:  “Should the Commission revise its regulations to treat contributions of bitcoin and other Internet-based alternative mediums of exchange as cash contributions or...as in-kind contributions?”  The process was approved by the agency late last month. Once the planned rulemaking is outlined and published in the Federal Register, the FEC will open the floor to public comment. The agency said it was particularly interested in comment from those who operate payment platforms and wallet services.  The fact that in-kind contributions can’t be deposited by campaigns into their official bank accounts could lead the agency to stick with the current rules. Still, the FEC is seeking comment on how any new rules might conflict with stipulations in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 regarding deposit requirements for donations.  Broader scope  The discussions at the FEC aren’t happening in a vacuum, however.  The potential change comes amid a broader conversation within the FEC about how to oversee elections in an era of digitization, which could also result in modernized requirements for electronic recordkeeping.  According to the agenda document, the FEC wants to update how it classifies electronic donations as a whole. It cites one study that showed roughly half of all campaign contributions during the 2012 election were sent either online or by way of email.  As a result, the rulemaking process will also encompass other electronic means of payment like prepaid cards and platforms like PayPal. At issue, the FEC said, is that the laws it is required to enforce “largely predate this technological evolution, as do many of the Commission's regulations”.  The agency continued:  “Thus, to implement FECA and the Funding Acts in a manner that accounts for the increased use of and reliance on newer technologies, the Commission is considering updates to its regulations.”  A representative for the FEC declined to comment when reached.  Looking ahead  Given that the FEC has only just begun its potential rule-changing process, it’s too early to say in which direction it might ultimately lean.  To get there, the FEC is looking to draw comments from the public, including stakeholders in the digital payments space that might ultimately be impacted by any new rule it creates.  The agency said:  “The Commission is particularly interested in the perspectives of operators and users of established and emerging electronic payment platforms – such as PayPal, Venmo, BitPay, Square, and other electronic wallet, swipe P2P, mobile app, and social media payment platforms – as to the operation of these proposed rules on those platforms.”  Coin Center, a public policy and research outfit in DC, said it plans to submit comment. Executive director Jerry Brito told CoinDesk that “we think it's great that the FEC is looking to modernize its rules”.  The organization has pushed in the past for the FEC to rework its rules on bitcoin donations, criticizing the $100 cap.  Yet even if the FEC does start classifying a bitcoin contribution as a kind of cash donation, it wouldn’t necessarily lift the $100 limit. As it stands, donors can only give up to $100 in currency to a campaign, an amount that drops to $50 if the contribution is given anonymously.

42399421,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj77t,1476879413,Nasdaq Sees Low Hanging Fruit in Blockchain Post-Trade,"Nasdaq broke a lengthy public silence on its blockchain work last week to discuss the technology's applications in capital markets.  Speaking at the Marketforce blockchain conference in London, Fredrik Ekström, president of Nasdaq Clearing, gave a presentation on what the US stock exchange giant sees as a low-hanging-fruit use case for collateral management, or the process by which credit risk is reduced in unsecured financial transactions.  Discussing the challenges faced by the collateral management processes, Ekström told an audience of financial professionals that he believes this area is a natural fit for blockchain as there are multiple parties involved, all of which need to share the same version of truth.  Today, the collateral management process happens through a series of messages among a clearing house, central securities depository (CSD) and a member participating in collateral management. But, Ekström said the process quickly becomes complex when there are multiple clearing houses, each with multiple members and each of which holds different types of securities at multiple CSDs.  Ekström explained:  ""The number of transactions and reconciliations increases drastically as we add more clearinghouses and clients.""  In this light, Ekström asserts blockchain could provide an easier way for market participants to keep track of collateral with lower overhead.  Elsewhere, Ekström presented his view on other processes in post-trade that would benefit from the use of blockchain technology as well as some projects currently in development at Nasdaq. This included the Linq blockchain platform for private market shares, and its proxy voting project first announced in February.  The event, attended by top financial services industry professionals from London and Europe, discussed the implications of blockchain technology for the industry, with broad consensus emerging that ""mainstream"" adoption is less than five years away.  Big picture  While it didn't contain any eye-opening revelations, Ekström’s talk did much to bring the big picture for how blockchain could come to be leveraged in post-trade into focus.  For example, Ekström presented his view on how the industry should look at post-trade processes when it comes to blockchain adoption. Instead of seeing the post-trade chain as one black box, he believes that the industry should try to envision a set of processes, which can over time be replaced or made more efficient with blockchain.  Broadly for the post-trade industry, he believes there will be two ledgers needed, a cash ledger and an asset ledger, which will be interoperable so that transactions can interact with both systems.  ""The collateral management system on the blockchain will include the member, clearinghouse, bank and CSD as part of the asset ledger and cash ledger,"" he said.  In a blockchain-based collateral management system, the end-of-day reconciliation of positions held by the member, clearinghouse and CSD could then be done by the blockchain instead of individually by each party.  But as part of his vision of going forward, Ekström said that Nasdaq doesn't want to go it alone (even though it could utilize operational efficiencies by doing so).  Instead, he urged the whole industry to consider solutions that can replace the existing infrastructure with blockchain.

42399423,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj7Aq,1476871209,Walmart Blockchain Pilot Aims to Make China's Pork Market Safer,"Walmart has developed a blockchain pilot focused on China's massive pork industry supply chain.  Built in collaboration with IBM and Beijing's Tsinghua University, the pilot is part of two separate, but parallel pushes by Walmart and the Chinese government to make supply chain data more accurate, and therefore safer.  IBM's head of global supply chain solutions, Paul Chang, explained that the pilot, if implemented, could also give Walmart a bigger slice of China's lucrative pork industry.  Chang told CoinDesk:  ""It's not just important for China, but for Walmart to really succeed in China. It is the most consumed meat of the most populous country in the world.""  China is expected to consume 54.6 million tons of pork this year, according to a recent USDA report, and that’s a slight decrease from original forecasts due to rising prices.  For example, a Wharton study last year found that China's high domestic pork prices are tied directly to food safety concerns — which is where the Walmart pilot comes in.  The blockchain prototype was announced today as Walmart opened its new Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center in Beijing. The office is intended to promote a more transparent food system in China, blockchain included.  Starting from scratch  To build the pilot, a Walmart team in China comprised of supply chain staffers, logistics and food safety experts partnered with Tsinghua University's National Engineering Laboratory for E-Commerce Technologies.  Constructed using technology from the Hyperledger blockchain project, the pilot is being positioned as a way to ensure the accuracy of farm origination details; batch numbers; factory and processing data; expiration dates; storage temperatures; and shipping details.  In the beginning, the pilot will be run on three nodes, one managed by IBM, one by Walmart and another by an unnamed supplier Chang said didn't want to be disclosed. But to give an idea of how large these suppliers can be, Chang, a 15-year veteran of supply chain traceability, said that by the time the project scales to 10 nodes, the industry could save ""billions of dollars"".  That's because when food is sold to a consumer at a Walmart store, each individual item will have been authenticated using the blockchain system to create a transparent and secure record.  According to a statement, a record created in the distributed ledger can also help the retailer better manage the shelf-life of it products in individual stores.  Safer supply chains  Following multiple reports of contamination in both China’s food and drug industries, the China Food and Drug Administration earlier this year proposed the adoption of measures to improve product traceability.  While the push for more stringent supply chain controls by the government was cited in today's statement as a ""critical step"" toward helping eliminate contamination, increased regulation is usually accompanied by higher prices. In May, regulation of China's baby-milk powder industry was credited for increased competition and decreasing revenue in a South China Morning Post report.  Though Walmart doesn't break down its revenue numbers by country in its annual report, a Reuters article last year indicated that the retailer was falling short of its plans for China to account for a quarter of its global retail growth.  With an estimated $1tn to be saved by moving global supply chain to a blockchain, Walmart stands to not only help China makes its food safer, but cut corners on cost.  Mangoes and beyond  But Chang said IBM is already well advanced in another effort that implements lessons learned from the project in a totally different industry.  He described an unannounced project currently underway to transport mangos as ""slightly smaller in scope"" but ""much broader in terms of the number of agencies"".  ""We are starting this with a pretty big splash doing pork in China,"" said Chang. ""But we already have plans to launch into a multinational plan to track mangos from south American to the US.""  From there, he expects IBM and its competitors in the blockchain supply chain space to move from one commodity to another.  He concluded:  ""This is the missing link that I think could finally encourage the industry to adopt this technology for the benefit of efficient trades and the benefit of the consumers they serve.""

42399400,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj6t8,1476835850,Winklevoss Brothers Tap State Street for Key Bitcoin ETF Role,"State Street has been tapped to help launch the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).  In a new SEC filing, State Street is now listed as the administrator and transfer agent for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, a proposed bitcoin ETF backed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the founders of the Gemini bitcoin exchange.  According to the filing, State Street would be responsible for the ""day-to-day administration of the Trust"" when it is launched, as well as maintaining its books of account and calculating the Trust’s net-asset value (NAV), or the value per share of the offering.  Also noteworthy are other changes that address questions that have come up during the filing's still ongoing comment period.  For example, the filing indicates the ETF would use a ""purpose-built"" system to verify that the associated custodians hold control of the private cryptographic keys that would allow them to transition ownership.  The new documentation touts this as a benefit of the Winklevoss filing in comparison to other efforts that have sprung up to launch alternative bitcoin ETFs.  ""Other Digital Asset ETPs may not be able to or willing to provide 'proof of control' of the private keys that control their bitcoin,"" the filing reads.  Waiting game  While a step forward, the development comes amid a now years-long effort by the Winklevoss brothers to launch the ETF as a way to allow investors additional exposure to digital currency market movements.  The effort picked up momentum earlier this summer when the Winklevoss brothers filed to move their application to the BATS exchange, a decision that has set off what has become an extended period of public comment.  Despite the advancements, however, market observers believe it could be years before any of the multiple proposed bitcoin ETFs goes live.  Adding fuel to this speculation is the relative lack of education about digital currencies, as well as the continued issues faced by the bitcoin exchange sector, which remains plagued by breaches and security issues.
