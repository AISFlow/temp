16822588,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549596,1693522844,"Bitcoin Cash Traders Move Into Profit, But Can The Rally Continue?","As the price of Bitcoin and the general crypto market has rallied, leading to a much-needed increase in price, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) investors are once again on a profitable path. The majority of investors are now in the green following its double-digit surge in the last week. But now the question posed is, will the price of BCH continue to maintain this surge? Bitcoin Cash Short And Long-Term Holders Enjoy Profits In a Thursday post, on-chain data tracking platform Santiment revealed that both short and long-term holders of Bitcoin Cash are doing quite well right now. The chart shared by the tracker showed that the average returns for 30-day and 365-day holders have risen above their average cost price. Related Reading: Grayscale Victory Sends Bitcoin Open Interest Surging After Hitting One-Year Lows This means that investors who got into the digital asset in the last month, as well as those who have been holding for a year, are the ones doing well right now. It is also the first time in 10 weeks that this cohort of BCH investors is seeing profit. Short and long term BCH traders move into profit | Source: Santiment on X The data from Santiment is also backed up by that from another on-chain tracker IntoTheBlock. According to the latter’s data on its website, 59% of all BCH investors are seeing green compared to 38% sitting in the red and 3% in neutral territory. Furthermore, IntoTheBlock shows that 96% of holders have held for more than one year, with 3% holding between 1-12 months, and 1% holding for less than one month. Combining the data from both trackers tells us that there are more long-term investors in profit compared to short-term investors. This fact reinforces the long-standing belief that buying and holding is usually the best way to invest in cryptocurrencies. But Can BCH Hold Its Gains? The fact that so many short and long-term holders are currently in profit can be attributed to the digital asset’s spike in the last week. Following the Grayscale ruling that saw the market surge, BCH’s price rose over 14%, bringing its value to the $220 level before the retracement. Most of these gains have been sustained so far, as evidenced by the high percentage of holders in profit. Related Reading: Is Vitalik Buterin Selling His ETH Stash? Let’s Take A Look At His Transactions However, Santiment points out in its report that for Bitcoin Cash to continue to rise, it would be up to the whales. This is because, during the price spike, there was an increase in whale activity in relation to the BCH token. So they likely played a part in the asset’s rise. If the whales continue to be active and put buying pressure on the coin, then the price of BCH could continue to appreciate. However, a turn from buy to sell among these large holders would quickly crash the price, especially since the market is already feeling the euphoria felt earlier this week start to recede. Presently, data from Coinmarketcap shows that Bitcoin Cash is trading at $219, a 14.57% increase in the last week.

The company's next-generation data centers are designed for power dense computing and use 100% renewable energy. The move into AI/HPC offers potential embedded value in the stock and mitigates risk tied to Bitcoin mining profitability. Entry into HPC Data Center Market Iris Energy ( IREN ) recently announced that it had purchased 248 Nvidia H100 GPUs for $10 million. This purchase signifies the expansion into using the company's existing data centers for ""adjacent computing markets, including generative AI, is enabled through:"" Next-generation data centers designed, tested and proven for power dense computing. Proprietary, high-efficiency cooling systems 100% renewable energy 760MW of available power capacity Management team track record & experience Dan Roberts, the company's CEO, stated: “Leveraging our next-generation data centers into generative AI is an exciting opportunity, particularly given current industry shortages in rack space and compute. We believe demand for sustainable computing is unlikely to go away, and feel we are uniquely positioned to capture ongoing growth in the broader industry; whether that be ASICs for Bitcoin mining, or GPUs for generative AI and beyond.” Free Option To be clear, the company's main business remains Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining, and I as laid out in my first article on the company ""Iris Energy: Reasonable and Renewable Play on Bitcoin"" , the business is nicely profitable at these levels and remains profitable as long as Bitcoin stays above $18,000. Even though the shares have appreciated nicely since that first article, the entire crypto universe has appreciated and IREN remains at a tremendous discount versus other miners such as Marathon Digital ( MARA ) and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), as well as companies like Coinbase ( COIN ) and MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) whose business models and valuations make no sense in my opinion. Since the market values IREN's existing Bitcoin mining operation at a large discount to its peers, it would appear it's not ascribing much, if any, value to this foray into AI/HPC data centers. in a market where all things AI are bid up to the moon. I find that odd. The stock was up over 20% the day of the Nvidia purchase announcement, but it's hard to tell whether the announcement was the cause or the Grayscale ETF announcement drove that move. I have a lot of trouble quantifying the opportunity here, as the move to AI/HPC data center is so nascent, and many business models in the space sport enormous market valuations despite incurring significant GAAP losses and burning cash. C3.ai ( AI ), for example, lost $284 million of EBITDA on $266 million in revenue in the most recent fiscal year and burned over $100 million of cash even after adjusting for working capital. Yet, the market ascribes it a ~$3 billion enterprise value and over $3.7 billion market cap. Digital Realty ( DLR ) has burned cash for its normal operating activities every year of its existence, has a highly leveraged balance sheet, and yet still sports a $40 billion market cap and $60 billion enterprise value. I'm not calling for anything near that level of value on IREN. Frankly, I don't have to for the stock to perform nicely. As of its May operational update filing, the company had ~$55 million. Based on the table below and Bitcoin's performance, I estimate that the company has been conservatively running at a $65 million annual EBITDA level year to date, perhaps higher. Iris Energy Profitability at Bitcoin Threshold Prices (Iris Energy May Presentation) With ~60 million shares, the company sports ~$300 million market cap and ~$250 million enterprise value. At just ~4x multiple of its Bitcoin mining EBITDA (an effort that generates cash) and a market cap that is peanuts to companies that burn cash annually, I think it's fair to say that even a fraction of the value ascribed to DLR, C3.ai, MARA, or RIOT would have big implications to IREN. Again, I struggle to come up with a dollar impact on the stock. Sell-side target prices range from $8 to $24, so they have difficulty pricing this opportunity as well. Just taking the lower end of that range versus the stock's current price of $5 is decent appreciation and still ascribes little dollar value to this entry into Ai/HPC data centers. I believe it's fair to say that should this purchase of Nvidia chips act as a starting point for much bigger effort, there is a lot of potential embedded value in the stock that could be realized as people start looking at this company as an AI play. Risk All crypto (and now all AI-related names) are inherently volatile. This company has the added risk of much of its profitability being tied to Bitcoin pricing and its ability to mine Bitcoin profitably. I believe entry into AI/HPC computing offers mitigation to that risk as well as upside as a separate business line, but it will take some time and investment to get Ai/HPC to the same scale and profitability as the Bitcoin mining effort. Conclusion In a market where a lot of companies trade at sky-high valuations despite non-existent profits, weak balance sheets, questionable regulatory viability, and uncertain business models, I continue to find IREN a name that offers a solid balance sheet, high-margin profits, a sustainable competitive advantage, low regulatory risk, confidence-inspiring management, and now a second, potentially-explosive business line all for a reasonable absolute and relative valuation. This company has the odd combination of value and growth. The stock has moved up nicely since I first wrote about it. I think the low end of the sell side's target price range of $8 (close to my original assertion of a potential double when I first wrote about the company (~$7.50 target) is a fair and likely conservative target.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4632446-iris-energy-nvidia-chip-purchase-signifies-entry-into-aihigh-performance-computing-space?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/16820001.jpeg

16819502,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549655,1693519205,"Bitcoin Unveiled Trail: Q4 Tumble, ETF Battles, Mt. Gox Drama, And Economic Shivers Await","In a recent legal win for Grayscale against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Bitcoin (BTC) soared to $27,000. However, the bullish sentiment seems to have waned as the cryptocurrency has retraced to $26,000. QCP Capital, a cryptocurrency analysis firm, has provided valuable insights into the implications of this ruling and the overall market outlook. BTC’s Short-Term Challenges Persist According to QCP, while the ruling is a positive outcome for the industry, the firm notes that its near-term impact on spot prices is “inconsequential.” The firm cautions against getting caught up in the short-term “knee-jerk pump” in spot prices and volatility, suggesting it may present an opportunity to fade such fluctuations. Related Reading: Court Says Yes To Binance Request In Case Against SEC It is important to note that the ruling does not equate to approval of Grayscale’s application nor guarantees approval for the refilling of GBTC. The SEC still holds the authority to reject the refilling on new grounds. However, QCP Capital believes that the ruling solidifies the likelihood of an eventual approval for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded Fund (ETF) while increasing the probability that the SEC will defer the decision to the March 2023 final deadline. What’s concerning, is that QCP Capital’s wave count analysis, previously shared in their update two weeks ago, suggests that a final push higher to conclude the B wave correction is probable in the coming weeks. This, coupled with positive developments in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) sector led by companies like NVIDIA and recent strength in traditional proxies such as Gold and Rates, creates a more favorable environment for cryptocurrencies. Despite these positive factors, QCP Capital anticipates a potential Q4 2023 start near the market lows. They attribute this to fading optimism surrounding the spot ETF due to SEC delays and a perceived lack of innovation within the cryptocurrency sector compared to other technology sectors. Additionally, the upcoming Mt. Gox payout is expected to exert short-term bearish pressure on the market. However, QCP Capital remains optimistic about a significant rally in Q1 of 2024. They anticipate the likely approval of the ETF in March, coinciding with the upcoming Bitcoin halving in April, and a potential US economic slowdown in Q2. To capitalize on this outlook, the firm suggests considering a topside end March 2024 option structure, which offers limited loss and the potential for a substantial payout if the bullish scenario unfolds. Bitcoin Faces Downside Pressure According to Material Indicators, a prominent analysis firm’s algorithmic models, called Trend Precognition, indicate a downside trend on multiple timeframes for Bitcoin (BTC). The Daily chart, which closes in less than 9 hours, the Weekly chart, which closes in 3 days, and the Monthly chart, which closes in less than 9 hours, all point towards a potential test of support shortly. Related Reading: Dogecoin And Bitcoin Become Latest Additions To Robinhood Wallet Per the firm’s analysis, the Weekly signal would be invalidated if BTC’s price moves and holds below the $25,350 level. However, if support holds above the lower low (LL) at $24,750, it would provide a solid foundation for a potential rally and a retest of resistance. Overall, both QCP Capital and Material Indicators concur that the analysis points towards continuing Bitcoin’s current downtrend in the short term. Presently, Bitcoin is trading at $26,100, reflecting a 3% decline over the past 24 hours. The upcoming days will reveal whether these projected scenarios materialize or if the cryptocurrency manages to consolidate at its current level, resulting in sideways price action.

Will Bitcoin Touch $8,000? It is worth noting that Bitcoin has undergone a fair share of price fluctuations since its inception. In the interview, McGlone compared Bitcoin’s volatile nature to the days of the stock market. His predictions, grounded in his analytical observations, also prompted apprehension and agreement. Related Reading: Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Keep The Faith: 40% Supply Remains Untouched For Over 3 Years Mike McGlone’s interview was rife with insights into the cryptocurrency market, but one statement stood out: his belief that Bitcoin could plunge to a low of $8,000 in the current bear market. McGlone emphasized that despite the potential for such a drastic drop. Bitcoin remains the world’s top-performing asset. McGlone stated that Bitcoin hasn’t exhibited deflationary characteristics like Treasury bills and gold. Instead, he pointed out that macroeconomic elements, particularly the Federal Reserve’s ongoing tightening policies, continue to have a pronounced effect on Bitcoin’s price. Institutional Influence: Not the Immediate Boost Many Anticipate? Another popular belief within the crypto community is that spot ETF approvals, and an influx of institutional investors would catapult Bitcoin’s price to new heights. McGlone, however, expressed skepticism regarding this sentiment. In his view, while a spot ETF approval may sway market sentiment, it might not substantially impact Bitcoin’s price trajectory. McGlone suggested that the earliest spot ETF might not see daylight until next year. On which spot ETF could potentially make the first move, McGlone’s bet is on BlackRock. Citing the institution’s commanding presence in the market and its reputation as the world’s leading asset manager, he believes BlackRock might lead the pack in the spot ETF space. McGlone maintained confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term bullish prospects despite these short-term projections. He reaffirmed his vision of the crypto giant eventually reaching a value of $200,000.

42419696,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFNvB,1693513458,The Trillion Dollar Crypto Opportunity: Real World Asset Tokenization,"At what we hope is the end of a bitter crypto winter, history offers foresight that good times will return.  According to the eminent professor Carlota Perez, technology is adopted in predictable waves — exuberant bubbles are followed by seemingly existential crashes prior to long ""golden ages"" of growth. We saw such a pattern back in 2001 when the so-called dot-com bubble burst and The New York Times declared that “Dot-com Is Dot-Gone and the Dream With It”.  Justin Banon is the co-founder of Boson Protocol.  Fast forward to today and we have witnessed over two decades and trillions of dollars of sustained growth, together with the transformation of the old economy. This growth was punctuated, as Perez predicted, by bubbles and crashes approximately every 20 years.  Web3 is another technological revolution, which is undergoing this familiar boom and bust cycle. Until now, Web3 has succeeded in installing a cluster of technologies with enormous potential for economic growth and transformation. DeFi, or decentralized finance, has installed the infrastructure to enable a new financial system which replaces intermediaries with code and replaces trust with the assurance of immutable smart contracts. However, until now, DeFi has mostly transacted magic internet money, in the form of crypto tokens.  See also: The Tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWA) Explained  Similarly, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have solved some of the problems of digital scarcity and enabled the democratization of creativity, but their use has mostly been confined to digital art, culture and memes.  In other words DeFi and NFTs may leverage superior technology, but are transacted primarily with volatile, small market cap digital assets.  According to Perez, this is both valuable and normal. New technological infrastructure is laid down in the initial installation period during a frenzy of investment, which is followed inevitably by a failure to meet such high expectations and a financial crash. However, it is this superior technological infrastructure that typically forms the basis of the next phase of growth.  A thesis increasingly shared within crypto and traditional finance is that the tokenization of real world assets (RWAs) will form the backbone of the next bull run and unlock the transfer of trillions of dollars of value into crypto. Or in Perez's terms, RWA tokenization will unlock a new Golden Age — in blockchain and traditional finance.  This is happening right now, already. The current state of play is that traditional finance giants including BlackRock and Fidelity along with RWA startups like Tzero, Securitize and Polymath, are using the blockchain to tokenize assets that actually comport with the real world. These categories include commodities, fine art, real estate and financial instruments, such as stocks and bonds. To quote BlackRock CEO Larry Fink: “the next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be tokenization of securities.”  Here, RWA tokenization merely reduces the role of intermediaries, whilst enabling faster, cheaper and more transparent transactions. However, the full potential of Web3 technology is not yet being fully realized, since most RWA tokenization platforms require trust in some sort of intermediary to honor the redemption of the tokenized asset. If the intermediary evaporates, then so too can the claim on the underlying asset. This problem is referred to as the physical asset oracle problem and can be demonstrated with this example:  If Alice tokenizes her car, and Bob buys the token; how can Bob be sure he will receive the car?  That's not something blockchain can solve directly, as it always involves some amount of human coordination and trust. However, there is an alternative, more natively Web3 way of addressing this problem.  Instead of tokenizing physical assets directly, protocols can lock up parties' commitments to execute a commercial exchange as a type of forward contract, encoded within smart contracts and tokenized as redeemable NFTs. When a dispute happens, it can be handled by an algorithm encoded within a smart contract that refers it to decentralized dispute resolvers. The result is trust-minimized tokenization, exchange and settlement of RWAs.  See also: How Crypto Tokenization Can Go Wrong (and How to Do It Right)  Such protocols provide a more rigorous answer to the fundamental question of tokenization: how can we ensure claims are met? And convey the same level of assurance as DeFi since transactions cannot be reversed, rescinded or censored. This level of assurance provides ""harder"" tokenized RWAs whose reliability enables them to be the foundations of a smarter, more programmable economy.  Otherwise, if a trusted intermediary is required it brings back in everything blockchain is meant to avoid like counterparty risk, friction and monopoly power.  As the world’s leading blockchain academic, Prof. Jason Potts notes, “Now that we can tokenize all the world’s physical products and services into a common, interoperable format; list them within a single, public ledger; and enable market transactions with low cost of trust, which are governed by rules encoded within and enforced by the underlying substrate, what then? Then, computable capital enables ‘programmable commerce,’ but more than that – it enables what we might call a ‘turing-complete economy’.”  Once Web3 technologies, such as DeFi and NFTs, are fully utilized to harden tokenized assets, we will not only enable a programmable Web3 economy but also a trillion-dollar opportunity.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Justin Banon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/31/the-trillion-dollar-crypto-opportunity-real-world-asset-tokenization,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dafd0360f1bd08f4ef44e1be56c65ff0b2285e97-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The token is the best performing digital asset above $100 million market capitalization, CoinDesk price data shows, vastly outperforming the broader crypto market proxy CoinDesk Market Index’s (CMI) 3.5% decline.  While there wasn’t any development to ignite the rally, MakerDAO’s fundamentals have improved recently, as the platform has returned to make profits after a brief increase in spending on incentives, Kunal Goel, senior research analyst at Messari, explained in an interview.  MakerDAO is one of the largest crypto lending protocols and issuer of the $5 billion stablecoin DAI. The platform has increased revenues through investing its vast stablecoin reserves in real-world assets such as U.S. government bonds and lending to banks to capture higher yields in traditional finance as part of a major overhaul called “Endgame.”  The platform earlier this month temporarily hiked rewards for DAI holders to as much as 8%, but the payouts erased Maker’s profit expectations, as CoinDesk reported. The platform lowered rewards and hiked borrowing rates, so it has been profitable again, Goel said.  MKR holders are benefiting from the platform’s profits via Maker’s token buyback scheme introduced last month, which reduces outstanding supply on the market using surplus revenues of the platform’s treasury.  The Maker-adjacent lending platform Spark also enjoyed growth, nearing an all-time high $700 million of total value locked (TVL) on the protocol, DefiLlama data shows.

16813710,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549598,1693512046,Ethereum Traders Capitulate As Rally Slows Down: Why This Is Good,"On-chain data shows that Ethereum traders are capitulating following the slowdown of the rally, something that may turn out to be positive. Ethereum Traders Are Selling At A Loss Right Now According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, ETH investors are getting increasingly frustrated as they are now participating in significant loss-taking. The relevant indicator here is the “ratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss,” which, as its name already implies, compares the profit-taking volume to the loss-taking volume for any given cryptocurrency. This metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin being sold/transferred to see the price at which it was previously moved. If this last selling price for any coin was less than the current spot price, then that particular token is now being sold at a profit. Naturally, the sale of this coin would count under the profit-taking volume. Similarly, the opposite type of coins would contribute towards the loss-taking volume. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in this ratio for some of the top assets in the cryptocurrency sector over the past few months: Looks like the value of the metric has been negative for most of these coins in recent days | Source: Santiment on X When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the profit-taking volume outweighs the loss-taking volume right now. On the other hand, negative values suggest the dominance of loss-taking in the market. From the chart, it’s visible that many of these top assets have seen negative values of the indicator recently as the rally that began following the Grayscale news has slowed down. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Returns To Neutral, Will Traders Embrace Greed Next? Ethereum, however, stands out among these coins as the indicator’s value for the asset is significantly more negative than the likes of Bitcoin and Cardano, who are observing loss-taking volumes that are only mildly more than the profit-taking ones. At the metric’s current value, the Ethereum investors are making loss-taking transactions at a rate nearly double that of the profit-taking ones. This difference between ETH and the other top assets would suggest that the coin traders are showing the least amount of patience. This could be because they don’t think the cryptocurrency would continue its rally anymore, or if it does, the profits wouldn’t be as large as for some of the other altcoins, so they may be exiting here at losses to go to greener pastures. This high amount of loss-taking could, however, actually turn out to be beneficial for Ethereum. Historically, whenever investors have participated in capitulation, rebounds in the price have become more probable. Related Reading: $28,100 Next Level To Break For Bitcoin, Here’s Why The likely explanation behind this pattern may be the fact that investors pick up the coins that these relatively weak hands sell with a stronger conviction, who provide a better foundation for a sustainable price surge. It remains to be seen whether Ethereum can use this capitulation to bounce off towards higher levels or if the rally will remain muted for a while longer.

42409762,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcP776,1693509839,"SEC Delays Spot Bitcoin ETF Decision for All Applicants Including BlackRock, Fidelity","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed until October making a decision on all of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications filed by applicants including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco Galaxy, Wise Origin, VanEck, Bitwise and Valkyrie Digital Assets earlier this year, according to agency filings on Thursday.  Already down sharply on the day, bitcoin (BTC) fell further on the news, now off 4.1% over the past 24 hours to $26,100.  The SEC began reviewing the latest slate of applications, from both crypto-heavy and traditional finance firms like Wise Origin (Fidelity), BlackRock and Invesco Galaxy, last month. The applicants hope to launch the first spot bitcoin ETF, which advocates have argued would allow for greater retail investment in the bitcoin space while saving investors from the troubles of setting up a wallet or having to buy bitcoin directly.  Today's orders see the SEC holding off on any firm decision, instead extending existing comment periods and allowing for greater public feedback on the applications. The new deadlines for Wise Origin, Galaxy and WisdomTree are Oct. 17, and it's two days later for Valkyrie. Bitwise now has an Oct. 16 deadline.  The regulator has a total of 240 days from when it first begins its review of the applications to make a final decision to approve or deny. SEC staff have traditionally used every possible comment and review period to delay making final decisions until those 240 days have elapsed, making Thursday's agency filings expected.  Earlier this week, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that some of the regulator's arguments in rejecting bitcoin ETF applications seemed ""arbitrary and capricious,"" after Grayscale argued that the SEC didn't have a firm basis to reject its bid to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. Grayscale and CoinDesk share a parent company in Digital Currency Group.  Judge Neomi Rao, writing for the unanimous court, said the SEC's denial of the application was inconsistent with the approval of a pair of bitcoin futures ETFs, and did not explain why it viewed these types of products differently given the underlying bitcoin market had a ""99.9% correlation"" between spot and futures market prices. Grayscale's argument that its proposed ETF was ""materially similar"" to the futures ETFs won.  ""First, the underlying assets – bitcoin and bitcoin futures – are closely correlated. And second, the surveillance sharing agreements with the CME are identical and should have the same likelihood of detecting fraudulent or manipulative conduct in the market for bitcoin and bitcoin futures,"" she said.  The SEC has used similar arguments in rejecting other ETF applications as it did in rejecting Grayscale's bid. The appeals court ordered the regulator to review the application once more.  UPDATE (Aug. 31, 2023, 19:42 UTC): Adds Valkyrie's application as one of those delayed.  UPDATE (Aug. 31, 20:11 UTC): Adds Wise Origin delay.  UPDATE (Aug. 31, 20:16 UTC): Adds VanEck delay.

Now, what do these developments entail, and how will they impact the future of Maker? Maker Empowers SubDAOs? On August 28th, the Maker team made a significant announcement regarding their plans to introduce SubDAOs in South Korea. This move represents a critical evolution for MakerDAO, marking the “final effort” to unlock the potential of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 and Beyond According to the announcements made on August 28th, introducing SubDAOs is expected to streamline, innovate, and strengthen the Maker ecosystem, paving the way for increased opportunity and growth. SubDAOs, which stands for Subsidiary Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, are expected to play a pivotal role in the next phase of MakerDAO’s development. These entities will leverage liquidity allocation from the Maker Protocol, exploring various yield opportunities across the financial landscape. From decentralized finance protocols to real-world asset solutions, SubDAOs aim to harness the potential of diversified investment strategies. Per the announcement, this presents a unique opportunity for Korean crypto leaders to engage with the forefront of DeFi developments. Participants will have the chance to be part of forming their own SubDAO or contribute to existing ones. This involvement offers insights into the success story of Spark Protocol, the first yield product incubated by a future SubDAO. Spark Protocol has demonstrated significant achievements, such as boasting high liquidity, industry-leading borrowing fees, and managing hundreds of millions in liquidity. Additionally, the event encourages forging connections between leaders in centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance. These connections are expected to help bridge the South Korean community to SubDAO token acquisition and farming opportunities, fostering collaboration and growth within the ecosystem. The move into SubDAOs signifies MakerDAO’s commitment to cultivating innovation across the industry. Participants can explore “cutting-edge” decentralized finance protocols and real-world asset solutions. The MRK Rally, How Close To A New Annual High? The recent announcements have sparked a surge in MKR’s price, following a decline that began on August 2nd, which coincided with the token reaching its yearly high of $1,371. Subsequently, MKR experienced a drop, reaching a low of $984 and breaching the significant psychological level of $1,000 and its 50-day Moving Average (MA), which had previously provided substantial support for the token. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Ethereum Show More Potential For Downside Despite Recent Bounce – Analyst However, with the recent announcements and the excitement surrounding the protocol’s new phase and increased liquidity entering its ecosystem, MKR has surged by an impressive 12% within 24 hours. Currently, MKR is trading at $1,170, surpassing and regaining its 50-day MA, which has played a pivotal role in driving Maker’s rallies throughout the year. Moreover, according to Token Terminal data, MakerDAO’s Total Value Locked has reached $5.16 billion, indicating a 3.03% uptrend in recent days. Considering these developments, the question arises: Is MKR poised to reach a new yearly high? During MRK’s rally, the token reached as high as $1,230 but encountered a strong resistance wall at that level. However, suppose the protocol’s developments continue to attract liquidity, and MKR bulls can defend its 50-day MA as support, while further consolidating above the $1,260 level. In that case, there is a possibility that, in the coming months, MRK could achieve a new yearly high above $1,375 and even touch the $1,400 level, a threshold not reached since May 2022.

16810265,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549574,1693504800,The ApeCoin Quandary: Why Additional Losses Could Persist,"ApeCoin (APE) finds itself grappling with a tumultuous period as on-chain metrics present a mixed picture while price charts continue to reflect the dominance of bearish sentiment. In recent weeks, ApeCoin has encountered a series of conflicting signals from its on-chain metrics. While such metrics are typically regarded as essential indicators of a cryptocurrency’s health, they have failed to provide a clear consensus on APE’s trajectory. Despite this ambiguity, one undeniable fact remains – bears are firmly in control of ApeCoin’s price movements. Related Reading: Can Shiba Inu Climb Before September Starts? Evaluating The $0.00001 Projection ApeCoin Price Plunge Persists Despite Short-Lived Rebounds Mid-August witnessed ApeCoin’s value tumble from a relatively promising $2.216 to a worrisome $1.66. Market observers and analysts swiftly responded by plotting a comprehensive set of Fibonacci retracement and extension levels based on this steep decline. Unfortunately, the downward pressure experienced by APE over the subsequent two weeks has prevented any semblance of recovery, pushing its value even lower than the initial drop to $1.66. APE price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko As of the latest data, ApeCoin’s price currently hovers at $1.48 according to CoinGecko, reflecting a 0.7% decline over the past 24 hours. This downtrend is further underscored by a 0.8% slump observed over the course of the past seven days. Despite such precarious circumstances, analysts are identifying potential bright spots within the gloomy horizon. ApeCoin (APE) has experienced two significant collapses, paralleling the decline of other altcoins in the cryptocurrency market. After dropping below the support level of $1.72 last week, APE has not managed to rebound. Despite efforts by APE proponents to push for an increase, they have been stymied by adverse market conditions. There’s a prevailing belief among experts that the ongoing bearish trend in the market could continue to negatively impact ApeCoin, potentially leading its price to plummet to $1. Investor Exodus Fuels ApeCoin’s Woes In tandem with the persistent decline in ApeCoin’s value, a separate report underscores the alarming exodus of investors, particularly those with significant holdings, colloquially known as whales. Faced with a lack of profit opportunities within the APE ecosystem, these whales have sought more promising investment avenues elsewhere. APEUSD trading at $1.49 billion. Chart: TradingView.com This mass departure has undoubtedly contributed to the accelerated downward spiral of ApeCoin. Consequently, as the coin grapples with mounting challenges, questions are raised about its near-term viability.

42409759,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcP70U,1693498024,Bitcoin ETF Applications Are Bitcoin's Best Marketing Strategy,"The biggest financial houses in the U.S. are peddling Bitcoin's message and don’t even know it. You see, modern-day marketing isn't confined to catchy ads or snappy slogans. It's about how a concept is presented, the narrative that's woven and the influence it exerts on decision-making.  Today, bitcoin (BTC) is more than just “magic internet money” or lines of code — it's actually reshaping the way we think about finance across the board.  Tim Haldorsson is the CEO of crypto growth agency Lunar Strategy.  At first, it might not seem like it but the recent buzz about bitcoin spot market exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications by heavyweight financial players like BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and VanEck is more than just noise — it's a strategic marketing move that's subtly rewriting the Bitcoin narrative.  Isn’t it remarkable how Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, did a complete U-turn on his stance on Bitcoin from years ago? In a recent interview, he pretty much said Bitcoin is on a path to fueling a revolution in finance.  See also: The Real Reasons the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF Decision Matters | Opinion  Let’s dive into why this ETF hoopla is a net positive for Bitcoin, regardless of whether these applications get the green light or face the red tape.  Bitcoin’s billion-dollar cheerleaders  When you and I hear the term ""bitcoin ETF,"" it might not trigger lightbulbs in our heads. But in a room full of financial bigwigs, that phrase carries a lot of weight. Why? Because associating it with exchange-traded funds is a gentle assertion that Bitcoin is knocking on the doors of conventional finance. With each ETF application, the leadership of major financial giants are signing up to do “word-of-mouth” marketing for Bitcoin. This canvassing goes beyond press releases, conferences and interviews, extending beyond the public eye to private – and much more influential – circles.  This particular news cycle is significant because it injects Bitcoin with a dose of credibility, bolstering its legitimacy as an asset class in the eyes of seasoned financiers. After many years of denial and disrepute, the gifted underdog is finally bending the ears of the powers that be. Even the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears to have read the room and is treating bitcoin as a “special” class of digital asset.  See also: Grayscale Victory Against SEC Clears Path for Spot Bitcoin ETF  Once an obscured outlier, Bitcoin now finds itself aligned with one of the most revered investment vehicles, and Wall Street is definitely starting to notice.  Greasing the wheels of momentum  Let's talk about the power of trends, the kind that Google Search volumes and on-chain data reflect. In a world where trending topics dictate dinner table discussions, data analysts have their fingers on the pulse of society's curiosity. As financial powerhouses get more skin in the game, they’ve become de-facto marketing partners for Bitcoin. BlackRock alone controls $8.5 trillion in assets under their management. There’s no shortage of resources to drive publicity around their bid to secure approval for a bitcoin spot ETF.  Bitcoin is more than just a niche curiosity, it's real “money”  The impact is near immediate: a powerful mood shift is building on the momentum of conversations in mainstream media channels associating ETFs with bitcoin. The stats check out too. The price of bitcoin surged to a 13-month high within a couple weeks of BlackRock filing its ETF application.  Why does this matter? Well, bitcoin's price is more than just numbers dancing on a screen. It's determined by an intricate choreography of supply, demand and market sentiment, and now on the verge of breaking into a trillion-dollar playing field, it rightfully deserves to be the heartbeat of a global conversation. The more discussions revolve around ETF applications, the more Bitcoin becomes a household name.  All press is good press  As the saying goes, “All press is good press.” When it comes to the subject of bitcoin ETF applications, that might just hold true. Publications, big and small, love to get their hands on stories that get people talking. But let's zoom out for a moment. Think about the bigger picture. The global economy is going through a pretty rough patch. Fiat currencies are buckling in the face of inflation, while bitcoin stands firm in the eye of this storm.  Nowadays, with finance heavyweights such as Larry Fink talking up Bitcoin on the world stage, the masses are finally tuning in. Shortly after BlackRock filed its Bitcoin ETF application, the CEO had this to say: “Instead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation, a hedge against the onerous problems of any one country, or the devaluation of your currency whatever country you’re in — let’s be clear, bitcoin is an international asset, it’s not based on any one currency and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative.”  Translation: bitcoin is a universal commodity and a great medium of exchange capable of facilitating the biggest financial vehicles in the world. That’s a sweet marketing pitch, if I do say so myself.  The narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainties is gradually taking shape again. This is starting to dawn on the largest market makers in the world, and in turn they are seeking to use ETFs as gateways for entering the crypto playing field.  Shifting regulatory dynamics  Some critics point to Canada and Europe's lukewarm response to bitcoin ETFs. But it’s not hard to imagine that things would pan out differently with a fully regulated spot market bitcoin ETF in the United States. It’s no secret that the SEC is cracking down heavily on cryptocurrencies, but any keen observer would’ve noticed a common thread by now. Regulators have focused their ire on altcoins for the most part. While stablecoins have also faced scrutiny, bitcoin remains the most likely digital asset to be approved as is for integration into regulated systems.  There is already a healthy roster of financial behemoths with treasuries worth hundreds of billions waiting in line for a bitcoin ETF application approval. The gravitational pull of the U.S. market cannot be underestimated, and the potential involvement of heavyweight players amplifies this influence.

As regulation rapidly develops in the United States, this narrative could play a pivotal role in tipping the scales of public (and institutional-level) sentiment in favor of bitcoin as a viable medium of exchange.  The conversation around bitcoin ETF applications isn't just about the expansion of financial regulations to include cryptocurrency; it's a strategic marketing move that's transforming Bitcoin's narrative. It's reminding the world that Bitcoin is more than just a niche curiosity, it's real “money” as far as the definition goes.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Tim Haldorsson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/31/bitcoin-etf-applications-are-bitcoins-best-marketing-strategy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3304653c6724776225b198f9175dbf5bfd019220-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The pseudonymous analyst told his over 224,000 Twitter followers that the flagship crypto assets may face more downturns. Applying the Elliott Wave theory in his analysis, Bluntz predicted that Ethereum is about to complete a five-wave pattern. According to him, Ethereum will decline to $1,450 on completing the wave pattern marked 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Bitcoin And Ether Could Face More Downturn Before A Bounce In Bluntz’s technical analysis, the five-wave chart pattern exists within a larger three-wave pattern marked A, B, and C. And this three-wave pattern is also on a downtrend. He noted that ETH and BTC must complete this wave pattern before a bullish upturn. Related Reading: This Metric Indicates Shibarium Is Growing Rapidly Following Its Public Launch However, while this analysis projects a bearish trend for ETH and BTC, Bluntz believes there is potential for a bullish breakout. He said the theory becomes invalid if ETH breaks above $1,804 or Bitcoin surpasses the $28,770 price level. Bluntz noted: Invalidation of this thesis is if we break $1,804 for ETH or $28,770 for BTC as wave-4 can’t go within wave-1 territory, Bears Intent On More Downturns For ETH And BTC; Any Hope For A Rebound? Meanwhile, Bitcoin and Ethereum are exhibiting a slightly bearish outlook at press time. Bitcoin trades at $27,211, with a nearly 1% decline, while Ethereum price is down by 0.89%, at $1,704. Bitcoin had also been under bearish pressure over the past seven days after slipping off the $29,000 support level on August 16. As the bears pressed on, the flagship cryptocurrency traded within the $26,000 price level, occasionally regressing to $25,900. The downturn was in tune with the bearish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market over the past few days. However, on August 29, the news of the court ruling in favor of Grayscale Investment in its case against the US SEC broke out. This news generated a buzz in the crypto market, leading to an uptick in market capitalization. As a result, Bitcoin recorded a sharp spike that returned its value to the $28,000 price mark. At the time, BTC’s price surged 8%, climbing from a week low of $25,860 to a high of $28,010. But the bulls couldn’t sustain the momentum as Bitcoin quickly regressed, dipping to $27,394. Bitcoin now consolidates around the $27,000 price zone, awaiting a bullish turn to trigger a rally. Ethereum Market Outlook Ethereum also met a similar fate as Bitcoin, exhibiting the same chart pattern and price movement in the last week. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap remained on a bearish trend in line with the broader crypto market. Ether’s price slipped off the $1,800 support on August 17, accompanied by a prolonged bearish momentum that pushed it to $1,600. Related Reading: Polkadot Price Target – Will DOT Hit The $5.5 Mark As August Ends? Just like Bitcoin, Ethereum reacted to the brief market recovery, pushing above $1,740 on August 29. While ETH’s rally has relapsed, it maintains a price level above $1,700, holding over 2% of its past week’s gains. However, ETH’s latest strides suggest the bulls are up for a recovery.

42409771,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcP7Nd,1693496700,Crypto for Advisors: Bitcoin and the Bull,"Before Bitcoin came into existence in 2009, there were a couple of attempts to create digital electronic money secured by cryptography. However, Bitcoin is recognized as the first leading crypto and has been the top-performing asset for seven of the last ten years. Equally remarkable is the scarcity of wealth advisors that support their client's investment in this asset class. A survey of 500 financial advisors saw 72% desiring to invest more in Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency sector if a Bitcoin spot ETF was approved. Yet, less than 9% of advisors feel confident advising clients within this asset class. The research underscores a massive educational gap between traditional finance and this emerging monetary system.  Bitcoin is heading towards its fourth halving, due to happen somewhere around April 16, 2024, where the difficulty of mining the coin increases and the reward decreases by 50%, part of ensuring there will only ever be a finite supply of this digital gold.  Thanks to Brian Rudick and Matt Kunke from GSR for taking us through the key points to consider when assessing the Bull Case for Bitcoin in today's feature article. Brian takes us through Bitcoin's origins, explaining its unique properties and why this asset matters to advisors.  – S.M.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  The Bull Case for Bitcoin  Bitcoin Background  Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous developer of Bitcoin, first released the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008 describing his or her vision for a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system.” At a high level, the Bitcoin blockchain can be thought of as a decentralized database or distributed ledger comprised of a network of computers called nodes that simply record and keep a local copy of who paid what, to whom, and when. Such payments are denominated in bitcoin, a digital asset by the same name with a 21 million maximum supply, and the network uses cryptography and a consensus mechanism to record transactions in a trustless, open and transparent manner (see How Bitcoin Works for a full overview).  Such a construct – an open network of unrelated nodes following code-based rules to agree on and locally record valid transactions without a central leader – results in Bitcoin’s key properties: Bitcoin is decentralized with no central point of control; trustless as nodes implement open-source software; censorship resistant with transaction history stored locally on thousands of unrelated machines; immutable as historical transactions cannot be changed; and permissionless as anyone can partake in the network. Additionally, Bitcoin utilizes new, internet and blockchain-based rails, rather than existing, antiquated financial rails, and its technology forms the building blocks for later blockchains that add programmability and arbitrary computation to the decentralized ledger. This makes the technology underlying Bitcoin the basis for novel use cases like identity, ownership, governance, computation and more, and enables the democratization of value exchange, removal of rent-extracting intermediaries, and establishment of new paradigms around ownership and governance.  Given technical limitations and a fixed supply, Bitcoin itself has evolved from its intended usage as a P2P electronic cash system to a store of value / monetary good, and it in fact exhibits many of the attributes of money including durability, portability, divisibility, uniformity, scarcity, and acceptability. While the technology underlying Bitcoin ushers in myriad use cases and benefits, it is precisely its simple and narrow monetary use case, undying code, and provable scarcity that had made Bitcoin the apex monetary asset and reserve currency of the digital realm.  Bull Thesis Tenants  A key tenant of bitcoin’s investment thesis is this status as the non-sovereign digital reserve currency. Given its leading decentralization and security, large network effects, and first mover advantage, it is highly unlikely that another crypto-asset can challenge bitcoin in this regard; anyone looking for a decentralized digital store of value is likely to select bitcoin, which then furthers this status. Moreover, the need for and importance of a non-sovereign, internet-native store of value should only grow as the world becomes increasingly digital and internet users increasingly demand a borderless, digital money outside the grasp of a centralized entity. To boot, the 425 million crypto users today represent just 8% of the population with internet access – a far cry from the potential upside scenario of ubiquity – and the market cap of bitcoin represents just 4% that of gold.  Source: Datareportal.com, Zenith, Crypto.com, CoinGecko, Gold.org, GSR  The Crypto Opportunity  In addition, bitcoin may act as a non-sovereign hedge against government policy missteps, which may be of particular importance with increasingly large fiscal and monetary intervention around the globe. In fact, bitcoin’s provably finite supply suggests it may provide some insulation from inflation, negative interest rates, and other consequences of unorthodox or potentially harmful policy. Bitcoin’s history is too limited to say whether this has thus far been the case, though there has been a significant correlation between inflation expectations and the price of bitcoin. And, there are multiple examples of investors flocking to bitcoin when inflation worries increase or during periods of stress in the traditional financial system, as we saw with the recent banking crisis.  Lastly, bitcoin also offers many benefits from a portfolio construction perspective. Bitcoin adds key diversification benefits to a well-balanced portfolio with its low historical correlation to traditional assets. Moreover, its historical returns have more than compensated for its immense volatility, and such volatility makes bitcoin extremely capital efficient when evaluated through a portfolio allocation lens. Indeed, adding just a 1-2% allocation to bitcoin has a large positive impact on a portfolio’s risk-adjusted returns, both on an absolute basis and relative to adding other asset classes.  In conclusion, Bitcoin is truly a novel creation. Tens of thousands of computers around the world come together to keep a decentralized, trustless, permissionless, censorship resistant, and immutable ledger of payments that reimagines the financial rails and gives rise to novel use cases and benefits. Bitcoin is the non-sovereign reserve currency of the digital realm, and its role and importance should only grow with compounding network effects and as the world becomes more digitized. Moreover, bitcoin can act as a hedge against global policy missteps, and it may inexpensively add diversification to well-balanced portfolios to improve overall risk-adjusted returns.  – Brian Rudick, Senior Strategist and Matt Kunke, CFA, Research Analyst, GSR  Ask an Advisor: Clients Want to Know Why Bitcoin Matters  Q: What is the bullish case for Bitcoin as a good storage of value?  A: Scarcity. Bitcoin (BTC) has a hard cap of 21 million bitcoin that may ever exist, making it a potential hedge against inflation, exceeding on almost every level when compared to gold, the long reigning King of the Contrarians. Skeptical investors have turned to gold traditionally to offset the risk of a declining reserve currency like the US Dollar. Since its inception, we’ve seen a steady decline in the purchasing power of the dollar and each day someone is passing on that laments that fact that we are no longer on the gold standard and someone else is coming into their prime earning years that has only ever spent money on their smartphone. The perception of what funny money is can quickly be turned on its head as younger investors see gold as problematic on many levels from how workers are treated in gold mining operations to the fact that while gold may have been the scarcest asset a hundred years ago, it is not hard capped.  Q: What is the bullish case for Bitcoin’s long-term rise in value?  A: Eventual federal regulation. Following the very high-profile 2022 meltdown at FTX, 2023 felt like it might be the year we would see the first federal regulations coming into play with Gary Gensler as the current SEC Chairman, and the fact that Mr. Gensler himself had taught a course at MIT on Blockchain. So far, Gensler has opted to sue individual exchanges like Coinbase and Binance before putting any clear regulations in place. With the largest financial firms unwilling or unable to even transact in crypto Assets in a pre-regulation world, this presents a large problem for the crypto affluent, seeking to bring their digital wealth into the personal estate plan.

16801288,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549613,1693494154,"XRP Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 and Beyond","XRP has been one of the most controversial cryptocurrencies since its creation by Ripple Labs in 2012. Its close ties to traditional finance have alienated parts of the crypto community. However, it retains a loyal following for its fast and cheap transactions. This XRP price prediction guide examines the coin’s outlook using technical analysis methods. What is XRP? XRP is a cryptocurrency created by the Ripple payment network to facilitate fast cross-border payments. Ripple Labs founders Arthur Britto, David Schwartz, and Chris Larsen designed it to overcome Bitcoin’s scalability issues while enabling seamless transfers between different currencies. Some key features of XRP include: Speed Settlement of XRP transactions takes 3-5 seconds, far faster than Bitcoin’s 10+ minutes. Low cost XRP transaction fees are a fraction of a penny, making it affordable for micropayments. Fixed supply The total supply of 100 billion XRP was created at launch, unlike Bitcoin’s limited issuance schedule. Bank partnerships Ripple has partnered with over 300 banks and financial institutions to use XRP for settlement. Controversies XRP has been mired in controversy regarding everything from centralization to securities classification. XRP is designed for use by financial institutions, though it trades publicly on exchanges. Its adoption rate will likely depend significantly on the outcome of Ripple’s ongoing SEC lawsuit. Factors Influencing XRP Price Numerous factors impact XRP prices, leading to high volatility: Ripple Company Developments and XRP Regulatory Status Ripple’s partnerships, service offerings, and legal issues have significant ramifications for XRP’s price action. For example, the SEC deeming XRP kept the asset from making new all-time highs during the 2020 and 2021 bull market in crypto. Now that Ripple has won the case against the SEC and a US judge deeming XRP not a security, new all-time highs could arrive during the next bullish cycle. Cryptocurrency Market Trends Like most altcoins, XRP’s price tends to follow Bitcoin’s price movements overall. When Bitcoin rises or falls sharply, so does XRP. Bitcoin itself has been struggling recently due to the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates. Mainstream Adoption XRP gaining transactional adoption from banks and payment providers would establish real-world utility and boost prices. But it faces stiff competition from private blockchains. Decentralization Efforts Lessening Ripple Lab’s control over XRP supply and the ledger through further decentralization could enhance XRP’s appeal and value to the crypto community. Burn Rate Ripple periodically burns XRP supply to manage circulation. Higher burn rates decrease available XRP which can positively impact prices. XRP Price History XRP’s price history has been defined by major announcements, partnerships, and controversies. 2012-2014: The Early Years XRP traded for a fraction of a penny initially. Prices remained relatively flat between $0.002 to $0.02 till 2017 as Ripple focused on building partnerships rather than exchanges. 2017: Crypto Bubble Peak As crypto mania peaked in late 2017, XRP saw massive speculative gains, rising from $0.006 in April to an all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018 – an incredible 63,000% return within 9 months! However, this meteoric rise was fueled by hype rather than fundamentals. XRP came crashing down as Bitcoin collapsed, declining over 90% within a year after the peak. 2018-2020: Building Products Between 2018-2020, XRP stayed afloat better than most altcoins, trading between $0.20 to $0.60 as Ripple doubled down on establishing real-world utility. Major developments included: Ripple launched On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) allowing financial institutions to use XRP for instant cross-border payments. Over 300 banks signed up for RippleNet to connect payment channels globally. Remittance firms including MoneyGram began using ODL for transferring funds. This suggested future adoption could be driven by Ripple’s offerings. 2021 – 2022: Legal Woes and a Bear Market Emerge After starting 2021 strongly with XRP exceeding $1 again thanks to crypto resurgence, Ripple was hit by an SEC lawsuit in December 2020 alleging XRP was an unregistered security. Many exchanges delisted XRP while its price collapsed due to negative sentiment. XRP failed to set a new all-time high while Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and several others as a result. Each of these other cryptocurrencies set a peak during this time, entering a bearish market in 2022. This lowered the chances of XRP making a recovery during the year. Recent XRP Price Action 2023 has been a difficult year for most cryptocurrencies, which are only starting to recover from the prolonged crypto winter. XRP, however, has outperformed most cryptocurrencies this year thanks to Ripple winning its legal battle with the SEC. A US court judge ruled that XRP is not a security when sold to retail investors. This caused several exchanges to relist the asset, and prices spiked from under $0.50 to $1 in 48 hours after the decision. The SEC plans to appeal the decision, which prompted a full retrace of the rally. Now what’s next for XRP price? Short-Term XRP Price Prediction for 2023 With XRP fully retracing the SEC court case ruling rally, sentiment is back to scared across the crypto market. Combined with other altcoins setting new lows, investors are fearful that the bear market might return. XRP, however, could be performing a throwback retest of ascending triangle resistance turned support, which is common in financial markets. If support holds, price could ultimately approach over $1 in the next attempt. Meanwhile, if price were to fall back through the bottom of the ascending triangle pattern, it would indicate failure and lead to a retest of bear market lows. Medium Term XRP Price Prediction for 2024 – 2025 If XRP can continue with its bullish market, then 2024 and 2025 could see the final move in the first major bull market sequence. Elliott Wave Principle believes that bull markets move in what’s called a motive wave, which is a five-wave upward sequence, where odd numbered moves are in the direction of the primary trend, while even numbered moves move against the trend. Corrections are typically labeled as ABC, unless the correction is a triangle, in which it is labeled ABCD and E. More complex corrections can evolve over time. Triangles represent the consolidation before the final thrust in a sequence. Price projections put XRP above $10, between $14, and $17 depending on momentum and supporting environment. Long-Term XRP Price Prediction for 2030 XRP’s long term forecast is a lot more difficult to predict using traditional technical analysis techniques. In this case, we’ve chosen to draw a price mean through years of price action in an attempt to project a linear trend line. Peaks and troughs would occur above and below the mean, providing the potential for mean reversion trades. The trajectory puts XRP upwards of $20 per coin in the future if the mean line is accurate. XRP Price Prediction FAQs Let’s look at some commonly asked questions regarding XRP price forecasts: What was XRP’s lowest price? During its initial couple years after launch, XRP hit lows between $0.002 to $0.005. Its recent low was $0.24 in July 2022. What was XRP’s highest price? XRP’s all-time high was $3.84 reached in January 2018 during the crypto bubble. It also briefly exceeded $3.60 in the same time frame. How high can XRP realistically go? Based on its fundamentals and adoption risks, a realistic best-case high for XRP by 2025-2030 is likely in the $10 to $20 range if it gains widespread utility. Reaching triple digits appears very unlikely. Can XRP’s price crash to zero? If Ripple suffered an existential threat, XRP could potentially crash below $0.01. But delisting risks have reduced after a US court deemed XRP not a security, making a complete collapse improbable without a catastrophic event. Why is XRP price volatile? As a cryptocurrency exposed to speculative trading, XRP experiences high volatility from hype cycles and shifts in investor confidence amplified by its low liquidity relative to larger cryptos. When will XRP’s price stabilize? XRP volatility should stabilize and gravitate closer to currency-like fluctuations once it establishes a reliable demand baseline among commercial users and institutions. But this remains dependent on Ripple’s success. Investment Disclaimer: The content provided in this article is for informational and educational purposes only.

16801164,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549583,1693494059,FTX Sam Bankman-Fried’s October Trial Date No Longer A Sure Thing,"Disgraced FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) trial is set to begin on October 3. However, a recent development suggests that his trial date could be pushed back. Judge Kaplan Could Delay FTX Founder Trial Date According to a Reuters report, Judge Lewis Kaplan, the judge in charge of SBF’s case, said he could consider delaying the trial slated for October 3 to give SBF and his lawyers more time to review discovery documents and prepare their defense. Related Reading: GBTC Shares See Volumes Climb To 2-Year High Amid Grayscale’s Victory Lap Judge Kaplan told SBF’s lawyers they could ask for a postponement if they needed more time. However, he clarified that there is no guarantee that he would grant it as the defendant must prove there is “a need” to postpone the trial date. To prove this, they must go beyond just stating the number of discovery materials they need to review. According to the Judge, there has to be “more meat on those bones.” A virtual hearing had taken place on August 30 to rule on the pending requests by the FTX founder’s lawyers. They had earlier asked that the government be precluded from using certain documents as evidence when the trial commences. The defense counsel had alleged the government had produced “an additional 4 million pages of discovery” on August 24, which they believe their client won’t be able to finish reviewing before his trial begins. However, the judge denied this request, noting that the government had clarified that they would obtain information continuously. Interestingly, before his bail was revoked, SBF had access to the Google documents, which form part of the documents the defense asks to be precluded as evidence. The judge stated that the defense’s alleged “deluge of documents” was “seriously exaggerated.” SBF and his lawyers will have to file a motion by the end of this week if they intend to ask for a postponement. The Judge also suggested that any postponement would likely move the trial date to March 11, 2024, subject to approval by the Bahamas government. FTT token struggles at $1.033 | Source: FTTBUSD on Tradingview.com Lawyers Ask For Temporary Release For Sam Bankman-Fried During the hearing, SBF’s lawyers asked for a temporary release for their client, stating that they had no faith in the provisions the government had made for SBF. Related Reading: Bitcoin Insider Trading Suspicions Take Root Following Grayscale Win, What’s Happening? Meanwhile, the prosecutors argued that they had made enough provisions for SBF as he had 70 hours a week to do discovery. Furthermore, his lawyers were allowed to visit him seven days a week, and they provided him with a laptop that he could use every day from about 8 AM to 7 PM Judge Kaplan stated he wasn’t going to rule on the defendant’s application just yet and asked for a joint report to be presented to him by September 5 as to the “exact situation” at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) where SBF is being held.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Points At Neutral Trader Sentiment The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator that tells us about the general sentiment among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency sector. According to the index’s creator, Alternative, the metric takes into account multiple factors for calculating this sentiment. The five factors it currently uses in the indicator’s value are namely: volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends data. Earlier, the index also made use of surveys, but for now, they are on pause. To represent the market sentiment, the fear and greed index uses a numeric scale that runs from 0-100. All values above the 54 mark suggest greed among the traders, while values below 46 imply fear. The in-between region means the presence of a neutral mentality. Besides these three basic sentiments, there are also two extreme sentiments, called “extreme fear” (taking place below 25) and “extreme greed” (occurring above 75). Historically, these two regions have been quite significant for Bitcoin, as cyclical bottoms and tops have usually formed in the respective zones. Related Reading: $28,100 Next Level To Break For Bitcoin, Here’s Why Now, here is what the Fear & Greed Index looks like for the market right now: The value of the metric appears to be 52 at the moment | Source: Alternative According to the index, the investors as a whole are sharing a neutral sentiment, meaning that they aren’t leaning one way or the other. Although, at the current 52 value, the metric is certainly closer to the greed territory than the fear one. Earlier in the month, when BTC witnessed a crash from the $29,000 level to below the $26,000 mark, the sentiment in the market naturally plummeted. Investors had become fearful and had remained so for the duration that the asset consolidated around these lows. After the rally spurred by Grayscale’s lawsuit victory, though, the sentiment rapidly registered an improvement and surged toward the current neutral values. The below chart represents how the Fear & Greed Index’s value has changed recently: Looks like the indicator's value has observed a sharp uplift in recent days | Source: Alternative While the sentiment in the market has seen a rapid improvement with the latest rally, the investors haven’t quite yet made up their minds if they want to give in to greed or not. Related Reading: Cardano HODLing: Long-Term Holders See 170% Rise In Past Year It’s possible that more positive price action would need to happen before the investors are able to fully embrace the bullish momentum.

The Judge, who oversees the SEC lawsuit against Coinbase, classified ether (ETH) as a commodity in her opinion on the ruling, even as the SEC has shied away from doing so.  A New York court classified popular cryptocurrencies ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC) as ""commodities"" while dismissing a proposed class action lawsuit against leading decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap in a Wednesday filing.  The lawsuit – filed in April 2022 by a group of investors against Uniswap and its creator Hayden Adams – alleged the DeFi platform violated U.S. securities laws by failing to register as an exchange or broker-dealer, offering and soliciting securities on an unregistered exchange. The suit sought to hold Uniswap accountable for investors losing money to “scam tokens” that were issued and traded on the protocol. The tokens cited in the suit include Ethereum (ERC-20) tokens EthereumMax (EMAX), Bezoge (BEZOGE) and Alphawolf Finance (AWF).  But Wednesday's ruling to scrap the suit before it goes to trial stated the true defendants of the case were the issuers of the ""scam tokens"" in question and not Uniswap. While Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chief Gary Gensler has so far shied away from calling ETH a security, Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the Southern District of New York directly called it a commodity and declined to ""stretch the federal securities laws to cover the conduct alleged,"" in the case against Uniswap.  The court's opinion on its dismissal of the class action suit could influence future litigation against decentralized protocols and perhaps even those alleging violation of U.S. securities laws.  Judge Polk Failla also oversees the SEC lawsuit against Coinbase.  Case dismissed  The decentralized nature of the Uniswap Protocol made identifying scam token issuers ""unknown and unknowable,"" leaving no ""identifiable defendant"" in the case, Judge Polk Failla said in the opinion following Wednesday's order.  In the absence of ""actual issuers"" of the ""scam tokens,"" the plaintiffs argued that Uniswap facilitated the trades at issue by “providing a marketplace and facilities for bringing together buyers and sellers of securities"" for a transaction fee, ""hoping that this Court might overlook the fact that the current state of cryptocurrency regulation leaves them without recourse, at least as to the specific claims alleged in this suit.""  The court also shot down the plaintiffs' argument that Uniswap was like the manufacturer of a self-driving car and that the protocol and its creators caused harm by creating a system that allowed for scam tokens.  ""Indeed, this is less like a manufacturing defect, and more like a suit attempting to hold an application like Venmo or Zelle liable for a drug deal that used the platform to facilitate a fund transfer,"" the opinion read.  Citing an absence of relevant regulation, the court concluded that the investors' concerns ""are better addressed to Congress than to this Court.""",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | UNI,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/31/us-court-calls-eth-a-commodity-while-tossing-investor-suit-against-uniswap,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a4447c02872ae57f9ab38525eb3b55a5c8fb4a61-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ether's 50-day simple moving average is on pace to move below its 200-day moving average, according to charting platform TradingView. The cryptocurrency's last death cross occurred in late January 2022.  The death cross shows the short-term trend is now underperforming the long-term direction and is widely considered a long-term bearish indicator. But past numbers suggest otherwise.  Since its inception, ether has seen six death crosses, of which only three lived up to the reputation, and the rest caught traders on the wrong side of the market.  Ether nursed double-digit losses at the end of 12 months following the death cross confirmations dated April 11, 2018, Aug. 2, 2021 and Jan. 28, 2022. In other words, a trader holding a short for 12 months following the occurrence of these death cross would have made handsome returns.  On the contrary, a trader holding a short position for 12 months following the first, third and fourth death cross would have missed out on triple-digit price rallies.  Most death crosses turned out to be contrary indicators, with prices rallying and averages following suit to produce a golden cross within three to six months of the preceding death cross.  To conclude, the death cross is unreliable as a standalone indicator. That said, the impending death cross is consistent with the bearish outlook in the ether options market and lingering concerns about the slowdown in Ethereum's network usage.

16795329,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549584,1693486801,Court Says Yes To Binance Request In Case Against SEC,"In a new development in the ongoing case between crypto exchange Binance.US and the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Court has approved Binance’s request for a new attorney. Following approval from Judge Amy Jackson, attorney Andrew Rhys Davies can now appear in court for Binance.US. Approval From US Judge According to a previous filing, attorney Andrew Rhys Davies had initially filed to represent Binance pro hac vice in the lawsuit. However, the federal judge had asked Davies to file a notice of appearance. Related Reading: This Metric Indicates Shibarium Is Growing Rapidly Following Its Public Launch In the latest filing details on August 30, Davies filed a notice of appearance for BAM Management US Holdings and BAM Trading Services – the company behind Binance.US. Granting the motion would mean Davies can now represent Binance in court pro hac vice, as the attorney is not licensed to practice in the jurisdiction. The pro hac vice is usually applied when an attorney who has not been admitted to practice in a certain jurisdiction can participate in a particular case in the jurisdiction. Davies’ addition to Binance’s legal team comes with years of experience in cross-border cases involving securities, banking, and financial regulation. “MINUTE ORDER granting 99 Motion for Leave of Andrew Rhys Davies to Appear Pro Hac Vice only upon condition that the lawyer admitted, or at least one member of the lawyer’s firm, undergo CM/ECF training, obtain a CM/ECF username and password, and agree to file papers electronically,” the court approval document read. BNB ranging $224 as market recovers | Source: BNBUSDT on Tradingview.com Details Of The SEC – Binance.US Lawsuit The ongoing lawsuit between crypto exchange Binance and the SEC has dragged on for a while, with both parties filing different motions. In its latest move, the SEC filed a motion for leave to file documents under seal in the ongoing case. According to law experts, this could imply that the filing was made to protect details of a criminal investigation into Binance. Additionally, it could have also been filed to protect the safety or identity of a witness or company involved in the case. Related Reading: Large Transactions Put XRP Price Under Pressure: Are Whales Making An Exit? Binance also previously filed a protective order motion against the SEC. Details of the court filing show that the exchange wanted relief from the regulators’ “fishing expedition” and requests for communications that have become “overboard.” However, Federal Judge Amy Jackson has since passed on the protective order motion to Magistrate Judge Faruqui. The crypto industry is closely watching how the SEC vs. Binance case unfolds as the outcome could set a precedent for how the regulator approaches the entire crypto industry.

42409760,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcP6nG,1693486800,Arbitrum Developer Courts Coders Who Already Know WebAssembly-Compatible Languages,"A lot of executives in crypto have set their business plans based on the expected arrival, at some future point in time, of a horde of mainstream investors who will bring billions of dollars of assets, and eventually trillions, over to the digital rails, as it were.  Behind the scenes, though, a perhaps more urgent pitch is playing out among leaders of blockchain development teams: how to recruit and encourage more computer programmers to ape into the nascent and still technically daunting crypto industry, or to cast their lots with specific projects.  That’s the gist of a new push by Offchain Labs, the company behind the Arbitrum blockchain, to draw in a wider swath of coders.  On Thursday, Offchain released Arbitrum Stylus, a new technical implementation that allows developers to build smart contracts using programming languages that are compatible with the WebAssembly industry standard format, also known as WASM.  The offering, now available for use on a test network, means developers can program with popular coding languages like Rust, C and C++ alongside languages that are compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM standard, which is far more common among today’s crypto developers.  WebAssembly, developed in the mid-2010s to write programs for browsers including Google Chrome and Firefox, has been adopted by several blockchains, including Cosmos and Polkadot, and it’s sometimes positioned as an alternative to the EVM.  According to Arbitrum, there are about 20,000 developers working in Solidity – the primary front-end programming language for Ethereum coders, but roughly 3 million that code with Rust, and 12 million writing in C and C++, according to Offchain.  Adding these languages is Arbitrum’s way of targeting new developers to bring over their projects and build on Arbitrum’s Nitro stack, while also maintaining compatibility with the wider Ethereum ecosystem.  “That's like orders of magnitude more developers using these more traditional programming languages that teams and companies are much more familiar with,” said Rachel Bousfield, tech lead at Offchain.  “If you're outside of this space, and you're thinking about, ‘How do I bring my video game that's written in C++ to the blockchain?’” Bousfield said, “being able to use the tooling you already know, and have processes for, and have all this talent already hired at your company for, it's a huge decrease in friction.”  Even though Offchain is putting out this technical feature, it will be up to the Arbitrum DAO members to vote on whether to deploy the tool to the main Arbitrum network.  “I think certainly by the end of the year, we expect it to be in a position where the DAO could vote on it and likely will vote on it,” Offchain CEO Steven Goldfeder told CoinDesk. “But ultimately, it's in the hands of the community.”  Read more: Arbitrum Temporarily Stopped Processing Due to Software Bug",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING | ARB,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/31/arbitrum-developer-courts-coders-who-already-know-webassembly-compatible-languages,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3297b4785c0f76ca21a7752116e0f49b79f4b991-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  X, the Elon Musk-owned social media platform formerly called Twitter, has obtained payments licenses from several U.S. states in recent months, including a currency transmitter license in Rhode Island earlier this week. While Musk has hinted at supporting crypto on the platform – even briefly switching out Twitter's bird logo to dogecoin's dog before its rebranding to X last month – the licenses allow for broader payments services to be offered. Musk has said that he plans for X to expand beyond social media posts, to eventually become an 'everything app.' The money transmitter licenses obtained since June from Arizona, Maryland, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri and New Hampshire indicate the tech billionaire may have plans to support payment processing nationwide similar to Venmo or PayPal, a company he co-founded. The Rhode Island license, while essential for permitting payments, is also a requirement for offering crypto services.  Bitcoin’s average trade size on most exchanges jumped to its highest point since June following Grayscale’s court victory Tuesday over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to data from Kaiko, the average trade size for bitcoin on crypto exchange Kraken increased to above $2,000 after Tuesday’s ruling from around $850 the day prior. Other exchanges saw similar action. The last time bitcoin’s average trade size was higher was back during June's bull run, said Kaiko. “This could suggest large traders are more active,” said Kaiko analyst Dessislava Aubert.  Cryptocurrency exchange Binance said it will ""gradually"" end support for its BUSD stablecoin, removing it from spot and margin trading pairs, and users have been asked to convert their BUSD into other assets by February next year. ""As Paxos has halted minting of new BUSD, Binance will gradually cease support for BUSD products,"" said the announcement from the exchange. ""Please be assured that BUSD will always be backed 1:1 by USD."" In the more immediate future, Binance is delisting BUSD as a loanable asset on Sept. 6 and will cease withdrawals of Binance-peg BUSD tokens via BNB Chain, Avalanche, Polygon and Tron on Sept. 7. BUSD's 24-hour trading volume is just under $900 million, according to data by CoinMarketCap.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the daily price action and trading volume for shares in ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, trading under the ticker BITO on the NYSE.  On Tuesday, BITO jumped nearly 7.3%, registering its biggest single-day gain since March 13. Trading volumes rose to $800 million, the highest since its debut on Oct. 19, 2021.  BITO likely drew strength from the spot ETF optimism triggered by asset manager Grayscale's legal victory over the U.S. SEC.  A spot-ETF is considered a better product that futures-based ETFs due to the latter's vulnerability to rollover costs.

Aerodrome, a product by Velodrome in collaboration with Base developers, hopes to act as a “business development protocol” for the Base ecosystem, supporting projects as they launch, onboarding new projects and tokens, and generating liquidity for the ecosystem.  Its creators hope to emulate the apparent success of Velodrome, one of Optimism network’s most used platforms which holds over $288 million in locked value. Like Velodrome, Aerodrome rewards its AERO tokens to platform users who provide liquidity, conduct swaps, or participate in governance.  AERO tokens have a total supply of 500 million of which 450 million are locked for four years, as per developer documents. The only liquid AERO at launch are the 50 million tokens reserved for voter incentives and providing initial liquidity.  How it works  A key problem faced by decentralized exchanges is that rewards emissions are tied to total liquidity, rather than to trading volume, which generates fees for the protocol. To combat this, products like Aerodrome allow holders of their native token, AERO, to lock their holdings for anywhere between one week to four years – in turn of veAERO, a vested AERO token.  The longer the lock, the more veAERO the user receives, which grants them more voting power on governance matters. This is the same mechanism used on Velodrome.  These locked veAERO are represented as NFTs, which can then be traded on different NFT marketplaces. Other users can then purchase these NFTs to gain outright exposure to the ecosystem, instead of having to buy tokens, locking them up and having to manage that position.  Users can use the veAERO tokens to take part in platform governance, and, importantly, help set the reward levels of trading pools offered on the platform. In return, these voters receive 100% of all fees and bribes received by the specific pools that they voted for.  Such features create a flywheel of liquidity, as users are attracted to rewards, purchase more AERO, and keep the platform running by continually voting on which project’s tokens to support, add, and further reward.  And the approach seems to be working so far. Velodrome, the Optimism project, generated platform revenues of over $3 million in the past month, data shows, of which $1.3 million were paid out as fees to VELO holders and users.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/31/aerodrome-fanatics-deposit-150m-to-base-blockchain-on-first-day,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3887885e1e1b81b22905cd52e3da0c057a78d118-1500x1009.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

16789449,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549556,1693479600,This Metric Indicates Shibarium Is Growing Rapidly Following Its Public Launch,"Shibarium has only been live for a few days but is already showing early signs of success. The Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, which hopes to provide lower gas fees and faster transaction times for the Shiba Inu community, has seen some impressive growth numbers in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL). TVL Crosses $1.4 Million Since Shibarium launched its mainnet, the total value deposited in the network has skyrocketed. The TVL recently crossed $1.4 million, indicating strong interest in the new chain. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Community Celebrates New Milestone One Day After Shibarium Goes Public Data from DeFi TVL aggregator DeFiLlama shows that the total TVL in Shibarium has grown to $1.42 million in the past two days. While this amount is small when compared to the total DeFi TVL of $38.731 billion, the rapid growth demonstrates the potential that Shibarium possesses. A look through DeFiLlama shows that Shibarium currently has seven protocols. The DEX DogSwap with a TVL of $794,582 accounts for most of the total TVL. Other protocols on the chain are MARSWAP, Woof Finance, WoofSwap, Shibex, LeetSwap, BoneDex, and yield farm ChocoInu. TVL rises above $1.4 million | Source: DeFiLlama Shibarium’s growth piggybacks on the vast community Shiba Inu has gathered in the past few years. But the network did witness some hiccups before its launch, as PeckShield reported that a total of $1.7 million was stuck on the bridge. Just hours after its launch, the network witnessed a flurry of user traffic, causing it to be temporarily shut down. However, this has been resolved as Shibarium developer Kaal Dhairya explained this was a fail-safe to ensure the safety of the funds. As of the time of writing, block explorer Shibariumscan shows that there have been a total of 599,554 transactions from 444,134 wallets averaging a daily transaction count of 68,402. Will Shibarium Translate To A Higher Price For SHIB? SHIB’s price has always reacted positively to Shibarium developments. Prior to its launch, the Shiba Inu ecosystem witnessed massive withdrawals from exchanges as many investors opted for self-custody in hopes of what the Shibarium launch might bring. SHIB also saw a jump in price after lead developer Shytoshi Kusama teased Shibarium’s launch on a social media post. Related Reading: GBTC Shares See Volumes Climb To 2-Year High Amid Grayscale’s Victory Lap It would appear, however, that the launch of Shibarium hasn’t really translated into a price spike for SHIB. At the time of writing, the token is trading at $0.000008178 and is down by 1.28% and 1.73% in the past 24 hours and seven days respectively. With the recent slump in crypto markets, Shibarium’s early success is a bright spot. This early success of Shibarium could potentially boost the price of Shiba Inu. As investors see the rapid growth in total value locked (TVL) on Shibarium, interest in the supporting SHIB token may increase.

""The findings have potential to remove significant friction slowing the growth of tokenized asset markets and enable them to scale globally as they mature,"" the press release said.  In June Chainlink and Swift announced that they would be collaborating with dozens of financial institutions to test how they can connect with multiple blockchain networks. BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon, The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation and Lloyds Banking Group and others collaborated with Swift on the experiments.  Financial institutions around the world are increasingly experimenting with asset tokenization with the goal of improving financial markets. A recent report from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said tokenization could help improve efficiency and transparency in bond markets.  ""For tokenization to reach its potential, institutions will need to be able to seamlessly connect with the whole financial ecosystem. Our experiments have demonstrated clearly that existing secure and trusted Swift infrastructure can provide that central point of connectivity, removing a huge hurdle in the development of tokenization and unlocking its potential,"" Tom Zschach, chief innovation officer at Swift said in a press statement.  Swift used Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to connect with different blockchains. Chainlink’s CCIP, which is designed to help build cross-chain applications and services, went live in July.  A report on the Chainlink and Swift experiments emphasized the need for regulatory clarity on tokenization and said that future work will require a greater focus on data privacy.

Despite this optimism, cautious conditions still prevail for prospective buyers in the volatile crypto landscape.

Although the Rhode Island license does allow for processing crypto payments, it also applies to broader payments providers like PayPal or Venmo.  X, the Elon Musk-owned social media platform formerly called Twitter, has obtained payments licenses from several U.S. states in recent months – including a currency transmitter license in Rhode Island earlier this week.  While Musk has hinted at supporting crypto on the platform – even briefly switching out Twitter's bird logo to dogecoin's dog before its rebranding to X last month – the licenses allow for broader payments services to be offered.  Musk has said that he plans for X to expand beyond social media posts, becoming an 'everything app,' and the money transmitter licenses obtained since June from Arizona, Maryland, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri and New Hampshire indicate the tech billionaire may have plans to support payment processing nationwide similar to Venmo or PayPal, a company he co-founded. The Rhode Island license, while essential for permitting payments, is also a requirement for offering crypto services.  ""I think a new social media company is needed that is based on a blockchain and includes payments,"" Musk said in a text message just days before the bombshell offer to buy Twitter for $43 billion back in April 2022.  In an FAQ answering common queries Rhode Island's Department of Business Regulation (DBR) specifies that firms requiring the approval ""include those transmitting money for its customers, including traditional wire transfers (like Western Union) and electronic transfers (like PayPal).""  The state's currency transmission license is also required for conducting crypto exchange and custody business, with an exception for fintechs in ""very rare cases"" where the firm ""is registered as a true 'agent' of the Rhode Island licensed currency transmitter ... and money transmission is not the core profit-making business of the fintech.""  Though they certainly open the way for offering crypto payments, the state licenses are not limited or unique to that service. In New Hampshire, ""'money transmission' means engaging in the business of selling or issuing payment instruments or stored value, or receiving currency or monetary value for transmission to another location."" The state also says ""an administrator or exchanger that accepts and transmits a convertible virtual currency or buys or sells convertible virtual currency for any reason is a money transmitter under federal regulations ...""  Western Union and PayPal have the same state licenses as X, and additional ones in line with the services they offer and the states they serve.

Still, Grayscale’s victory may have increased the likelihood that the “SEC will finally approve one or more spot bitcoin ETF applications,” analysts led by Mark Palmer wrote.  A federal court ruled on Tuesday that the SEC must review its rejection of Grayscale’s attempt to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF.  The approval of a spot bitcoin ETF could be a game changer for the crypto industry as it would allow a wider range of institutional investors to access the market. ETFs are popular because they allow market participants to invest in cryptocurrencies without having to purchase the underlying digital assets themselves.  Read more: Grayscale Victory Against SEC Clears Path for Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Bernstein  The panel did not compel the SEC to approve a spot bitcoin ETF, but said the regulator needed to revisit the arguments it used to support its rejection of Grayscale’s application, the analysts wrote.  The SEC also has the option to appeal the panel’s ruling, the report said.  Berenberg notes that crypto-exposed stocks surged following the Grayscale legal win, with Coinbase (COIN) gaining 14.9% and MicroStrategy (MSTR) rallying 10.8%.  “Approval of a spot ETF would be good for bitcoin, and anything that would be good for bitcoin would be good for MSTR,” the bank said.

The platform became the largest crypto platform by that metric earlier this month.  Friend.tech lets X (formerly Twitter) personalities issue “keys” on its app to access a closed group chat. The platform has earned over $4.2 million worth of ether in fees for creators over this period. The platform is built on Base, crypto exchange Coinbase’s new layer-2 network.  Data shows transactional activity on the platform has slumped from a peak of $16 million on August 21 to just over $700,000 as of Thursday – or a 95% drop in buying and selling volumes.  ""On-chain, some of the exit narratives seem a little exaggerated,"" tweeted analytics firm Arkham. It pointed out users continue to hold 3,870 ETH worth of keys, or just a 10% drop over the past week.  Cumulative volumes grew from $80 million to $85 million so far this week, flatlining from a multifold surge from $2 million to $80 million in the first two weeks after going live on August 10.  But actual user activity is seemingly chugging along. The data shows total users have nearly doubled in the past week – with at least 5,000 returning users daily, or those who use the platform on consecutive days.  New users have steadily dropped over this period, however, suggesting most demand or interest was met in the initial days.  Friend.tech developers claim over 75% of key holders use their app ""the next day"" and over 50% ""still use it after a week.""  ""The average active key holder spends over 30 minutes per day using friendtech,"" developers said Thursday.  A slew of personalities outside of crypto circles on X joined Friend.tech in the past few weeks, fueling its viral popularity, including the likes of Richard “FaZe Banks” Bengtson II, co-founder of the influential esports community FaZe Clan, NBA player Grayson Allen and a bunch of popular creators from subscription site OnlyFans.

42409770,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcP7ar,1693472149,"Bitcoin Holdings on Crypto Exchanges Dwindle to 2M, Fewest Since January 2018","The number of bitcoin (BTC) held in addresses tied to centralized exchanges slid to the lowest level in more than five years, partially reflecting a growing market sophistication.  The so-called exchange reserve dropped 4% to 2 million BTC ($54.5 billion) this month, the fewest since early January 2018, according to on-chain data analytics service CryptoQuant.  The decline represents both positive and negative developments, including the rising popularity of services like crypto custodian Copper's ClearLoop, which allows users to trade without moving funds to centralized exchanges.  ""It partly reflects the increased demand for services like Copper's Clearloop, which requires only a minimum of coins to be posted on exchanges, that are a natural progression of the crypto market where exchanges will have to work with lower balances,"" said Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport. ""Over time, this will make crypto currency's exchanges less important and exchanges might have to find new business models to keep profitability high.""  Matrixport joined ClearLoop in May, offering institutional clients off-exchange settlement.  Lack of trust  Since Sam Bankman-Fried's exchange, FTX, went bust in November last year, investors have increasingly preferred to keep coins off centralized exchanges. From what we know now, FTX, formerly the world's third-largest exchange by volume traded, commingled user funds, denting investor confidence.  According to Thielen, the dwindling exchange balance represents that.  ""The misusage of customer funds through the FTX leadership has reminded investors about the importance of self-custody,"" Thielen told CoinDesk.  PricewaterhouseCoopers' annual global crypto hedge fund report published last month showed that most industry players now prefer multiple forms of custody with ""only 9% of the respondents leaving coins exclusively on exchanges.""  Market-neutral, discretionary long-only strategies, quantitative long/short and discretionary long/short strategies overwhelmingly prefer third-party custodians. Among the four, funds with a long-only strategy hold the fewest coins on exchanges, in both commingled and segregated accounts.  ""It seems the overwhelming majority of crypto hedge funds are seeking to mitigate as much risk as possible after the events of last year, keeping only those assets required for day-to-day trading on-exchange,"" the report said.  One interpretation of a dwindling exchange balance is that it indicates investor preference for taking direct custody of coins to hold them for the long term in anticipation of a price increase. In other words, it shows investor confidence in cryptocurrency's long-term prospects. That bullish interpretation is still valid, according to Thielen.

Users have been asked to convert their BUSD into other assets by February next year in an announcement on Thursday. In the more immediate future, Binance is delisting BUSD as a loanable asset on Sept. 6 and will cease withdrawals of Binance-peg BUSD tokens via BNB Chain, Avalanche, Polygon and Tron on Sept. 7.  A decision to end support for BUSD has been expected since stablecoin issuer Paxos was ordered to stop minting the coin in February. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said at the time that ""BUSD will slowly wind down over time,"" although the timing of the phasing out was unclear. The decision to stop BUSD loans with a weeks' notice suggests those timelines have been pushed forward.  ""As Paxos has halted minting of new BUSD, Binance will gradually cease support for BUSD products,"" Binance said. ""Please be assured that BUSD will always be backed 1:1 by USD.""  BUSD's 24-hour trading volume is just under $900 million, according to data by CoinMarketCap.  The stablecoin was subject to a regulatory clash after the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)'s February order for Paxos to stop issuing it. Binance was subsequently sued by U.S. regulator the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on allegations that it was offering unregistered crypto derivatives products against federal law.  Earlier this week, signs of a fresh legal clash for the exchange came to light when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) submitted a sealed motion related to Binance, which allows it to file sensitive or confidential information without revealing the contents publicly.

A modest bounce has brought the price back to $25,600 at press time, down another 2% today to add to Thursday's 4% decline.  The headline number in Friday morning's job report from the U.S. government topped expectations, with 187,000 jobs added versus forecasts for 170,000. July's job gains, however, were revised lower to 157,000 from an originally reported 187,000 and June's numbers were downwardly revised as well. The unemployment rate in August jumped to 3.8% against expectations for 3.5% and 3.5% in July. In addition, wage growth was modestly weaker than expected in August.  Added up, it's fair to say the employment situation is softer than previously thought, but only modestly so. Today's new figures might mean the U.S. Federal Reserve can remain on hold with monetary policy for a bit longer, but it's not going to have the central bankers in a rush to begin easing interest rates.  With today's decline, bitcoin has tumbled about 9% since spiking higher to $28,100 on Tuesday following investment fund manager Grayscale's court victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in that company's bid for a spot bitcoin ETF.  The broader CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is lower by 2.1% over the past 24 hours.  Crypto markets likely to remain under pressure  ""I continue to expect a gradual sell-off in BTC for the next one [to] two months,"" John Glover, chief investment officer at crypto lender Ledn, wrote in an email.  ""Once the final [ETF] approvals are in place this will be very bullish for BTC, and for all digital assets,"" he said of the court decision. ""However, until then, market fundamentals that are impacting all risk assets and technicals will be the main drivers for the near term.""  ""Both of those are negative in my view,"" Glover added.  Crypto asset trading firm QCP Capitals forecasted bitcoin prices sinking to $23,000 to $24,000 in September in a Telegram market update.  ""We would likely still start Q4 near the lows as optimism on the spot ETF again fade into the backdrop with more can-kicking from the SEC side, and lack of innovation in the sector as compared to other tech sectors,"" the firm said, adding that a glut of supply expected next month, from a payout to creditors of the failed Mt Gox bitcoin exchange, ""will provide short-term bearish flow pressure to come.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Shaurya Malwa, Krisztian Sandor, Stephen Alpher",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/31/bitcoin-starts-to-retrace-grayscale-fueled-gain-sol-xrp-dot-lead-majors-slide,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc72bafc06af53c73f89ede559732eee8a965ce0-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

16783160,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549528,1693467048,Bloomberg Analysts Raises Approval Chances Of Spot Bitcoin ETF To 75%,"Bloomberg senior analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have raised their approval odds of the first Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States (US) to 75%. This development comes after the US District of Columbia Circuit ruled against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), stamping out the regulator’s denial of Grayscale’s conversion of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a Bitcoin ETF. Court “Unanimity And Decisiveness” Unexpected, SEC Now In Tight Spot, Analysts Say According to his X post on August 30, Eric Balchunas explains that the new stance from him and his colleague was based on certain developments in Grayscale’s case against the SEC. Related Reading: US Bitcoin ETF Approval Could See North America’s ETF Volume Rise To 99.5% Although the Bloomberg analyst stated that a Gracyscale victory had been factored into their last 65% approval odds of a Bitcoin spot ETF, the court’s “unanimity and decisiveness” in ruling against the SEC was quite unanticipated. Furthermore, Balchunas explains that the SEC now faces a PR loss as Grayscale’s victory received media coverage from top media firms across the country. Combining this situation with the recent court defeat, the commission’s denial of the Bitcoin spot ETF will be “politically untenable.” In their official report, both Balchunas and Seyffart also highlighted that the SEC’s dilemma worsens as it faces its first deadlines on seven Bitcoin spot ETF applications between September 1 and September 4. However, following the recent court ruling, the Bloomberg analysts believe the securities regulator will likely give a delayed order. Source: Bloomberg Finally, if the SEC is somehow able to deny all applications, the analysts state the financial agency will struggle to reject Hashdex’s unique proposal. On August 25, the Brazillian asset manager filed to introduce a mixture of Bitcoin spot and futures ETF, secured by the Exchange for Physical (EFP) transactions, instead of a surveillance-sharing arrangement (SSA) with a crypto exchange. Based on all the factors listed above, Balchunas and Seyffart rate the approval chances of a Bitcoin spot ETF in 2023 at 75%, with the potential of these odds rising to 95% at the end of 2024. Bitcoin Poised For Massive Gains If Spot ETF Gains Approval Following the influx of Bitcoin spot ETF applications in June, there has been much optimism about the potential effects these trading products could have on the premier cryptocurrency. A Bitcoin spot ETF tracks the price of BTC, granting investors indirect exposure to the asset without the risks of direct investment in the cryptocurrency itself. According to hedge fund expert Tom Lee, a spot ETF will likely create a high demand-to-supply ratio of the largest crypto asset, pushing its prices of BTC as high as $185,000.

16775869,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549507,1693462832,"Bitcoin And Cryptos Poised For Final Surge Before US Recession, Here’s Why","In the intricate dance of global finance, traditional economic indicators and the burgeoning Bitcoin and crypto market are becoming increasingly intertwined. Recent macroeconomic data from the US suggests a cooling economy, and this could have profound implications for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Macro Data Snapshot: A Cooling US Economy Yesterday’s data release paint a clear picture of a slowing US economy: Job Openings: The July JOLTS report indicated a significant drop in job openings, falling to 8.827 million from the previous 9.165 million, and notably below the expected 9.5 million. US ADP Nonfarm Employment Change (August): Actual figures came in at 177K, missing the estimate of 195K and showing a sharp decline from the previous 324K. US GDP (QoQ) (Q2): The actual growth rate was 2.1%, slightly below the estimated 2.4% and just above the previous 2.0%. PCE Prices (Q2): The actual figure was 2.5%, marginally below the 2.6% estimate and a significant drop from the previous 4.1%. Core PCE Prices (Q2): The actual data showed 3.7%, just below the 3.8% estimate and down from the previous 4.9%. Real Consumer Spending (Q2): The actual figure was 1.7%, slightly above the 1.6% estimate and down from the previous 4.2%. Pending Home Sales (July): The month-on-month data showed an increase of 0.9%, defying the -0.60% estimate. Pending Home Sales Index (July): The index stood at 77.6, slightly above the previous 76.9. Implications For Bitcoin And Crypto The cooling US economy, as indicated by the recent macro data, might be setting the stage for a (last) significant surge in BTC and crypto prices before a recession. Why? Because bad news is good news for the currently short-sighted financial world. Bad data means that the US Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates further and that Quantitative Easing (QE) is getting closer. The long-term consequences in the form of a recession are being overlooked. Related Reading: New Bull Run For Bitcoin If It Breaks This Level, Expert Addresses Elephant In The Room Joe Consorti, a renowned Bitcoin Layer analyst, highlighted the significant drop in job openings and the slowing job growth in August. He stated, “US job openings are at 8.827 million, the lowest level since September 2021. Worse yet – last month’s data was severely overestimated. Cracks are spreading in the labor market. Rate hikes’ impact finally hitting.” He further emphasized the paradox of weak economic data driving stock market surges, suggesting, “Bad news is good news right now. Sour data relaxes investor fears of a hawkish Fed – igniting hopes of relaxed policy to support asset prices. I don’t make the rules.” Michaël van de Poppe delved deeper into the relationship between traditional economic indicators and Bitcoin’s performance. According to him, the most likely case are no more rate hikes as the economic data is coming in terribly, through which Gold, Silver and Bitcoin will be running upwards. He pointed out the inverse correlation between the Yields markets and Bitcoin, suggesting that as Yields show signs of peaking, Bitcoin could be poised for a surge. “The 2-Year Yields are even more apparent than the 10-Year Yields, indicating a potential top in the making, said van de Poppe. Related Reading: Coinbase (COIN) And Bitcoin-Related Stocks Soar Following Grayscale’s Victory He explained that the previous top in November of 2018 marked the low on Bitcoin. Afterwards BTC broke down, but the top of the Yields resulted into the bottom of the bear market for Bitcoin. The continuation of the selloff on the Yields resulted in more and more strength on the Bitcoin markets. Van de Poppe added: The first real high in November of 2022 also marked the low of Bitcoin. And the previous time we started to have a substantial selloff on the markets for Yields (March ’23), the price of Bitcoin started to rally upwards significantly. Macro analyst Mortensen Bach’s predictions for the next 6-10 months also suggests a potential downturn for the USD, a decrease in rates, and an uptick for both stocks and crypto. According to him, the expansion phase of financial markets is coming to an end. However, there’s one last leg up for markets. While he believes that the soft landing narrative is nonsense, he warned of the repercussions of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes, stating, “FED jacked up rates by 500bp in 12 months, in order to try and manipulate the economy to cool off. This was a big mistake and we will pay the price for it, likely in 2024.” Crypto trader Daan emphasized the looming recession fears and the potential for rate cuts and increased money printing in the near future. He commented, “Recession fears will be all over the media soon. Bring on the Rate cuts & Money printing! (Not yet but doubt it takes much longer than ~6 months).” At press time, BTC traded at $27,264.

The price is now trading below $0.550 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.540 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

As of August 30, BTC is changing hands below $30,000 but remains firm. Bitcoin To $185,000? In a recent CNBC interview, Tom Lee, who regularly comments on Bitcoin prices, said a spot ETF will mop up all daily supply of the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, creating an “imbalance” that will inevitably drive prices higher. Based on this, demand will significantly outstrip supply, driving prices to $185,000 or higher. Related Reading: Cardano HODLing: Long-Term Holders See 170% Rise In Past Year Bitcoin remains the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap despite the sharp contraction throughout the past 20 months. At peaks, BTC surged to over $69,000 only for sentiment to shift in 2022, triggering a sell-off that saw prices declined more than half, bottoming up from below $16,000 in November 2022. While prices have since recovered, surging over 50% from November 2022 lows to peaking at over $31,000 in late July 2023, the crypto and Bitcoin communities have their eyes on the SEC. The stringent regulator has been adamant, dismissing previous applications for a complex ETF derivative directly tracking Bitcoin prices. While the SEC has approved a Bitcoin Futures ETF that tracks an index aggregating prices from multiple regulated exchanges, the nascent industry demands an spot BTC ETF. SEC Likely To Approve Spot ETF? Following August 29’s court ruling that supported Grayscale’s assertion that robust measures are in place for their Bitcoin spot ETF to be free from market manipulation, the community has been ecstatic. The ruling was a loss for the SEC, but the court didn’t mention or guide the regulator in approving a Bitcoin ETF. Nonetheless, following the sharp expansion of Bitcoin prices from around $25,800 to as high as $28,000, there is a section of optimists who believe the SEC has little wiggling space and have no option but to greenlight a Bitcoin ETF in the coming weeks if not months. Related Reading: XRP Poised For Bullish Breakout: Inverted Hammer Formation Signals Rise Above $0.8 Resistance On August 30, Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, two of Bloomberg’s senior ETF analysts, increased their odds of the SEC approving a spot ETF in 2023 to 75% (up from 65%). If it doesn’t get approved this year, they estimate that the regulator will likely allow entities to create this product next year since their probability is 95%. Their confidence stems from the fact that the “unanimity and decisiveness” of the recent court ruling in the SEC versus Grayscale case was “beyond expectations and leaves SEC with “very little wiggle room.” Moreover, in their assessment, the SEC has suffered a “PR” loss since the ruling was widely covered.

This landmark lawsuit has established intriguing possibilities concerning approving a much-anticipated spot Bitcoin ETF product. A Win Bigger Than Just Approval? John Deaton, the renowned lawyer representing XRP holders, is among the voices adding to this discussion. As the industry ponders the ramifications of Grayscale’s lawsuit triumph, Deaton provides insights into the prospects and timeline of the highly anticipated Bitcoin ETF. Related Reading: Renowned Economist Explains Why Grayscale’s Win Is Not Good For Bitcoin Price Deaton’s commentary arrives hot on the heels of a Bloomberg report. The report underlined that even if the lawsuit’s outcome doesn’t lead directly to the greenlighting of a spot Bitcoin ETF, the very nature of this win holds substantial implications for the overarching crypto environment. The victory, according to the report, particularly stands as a testament to BTC, its miners, Coinbase, and the entirety of the cryptocurrency domain, the XRP lawyer added: It’s a massive win for #Bitcoin , BTC miners, @coinbase, and the Crypto industry in general. Does it mean the @Grayscale Spot ETF, along with the others, will be granted immediately? No. But a spot ETF is happening. The relevant question is whether it will in 2023? https://t.co/uUZUJ94dHz — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) August 29, 2023 The Bitcoin ETF Timeline While the hope surrounding the Bitcoin ETF’s approval is palpable, the attorney provides a reality check to the community. Grayscale’s aspirations for the BTC ETF remain high, but immediate approval seems unlikely. Contrary to the gist of the Bloomberg news report, Deaton is confident about the eventual establishment of a spot Bitcoin ETF. Yet, the timeline remains uncertain. On August 29, Judge Rao of the Columbia Circuit approved Greyscale’s petition to transform their financial product into a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). This marked a significant victory for Greyscale in its legal battle against the US SEC, which had previously denied the firm’s application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF on June 29, 2022. Related Reading: Bitcoin Insider Trading Suspicions Take Root Following Grayscale Win, What’s Happening?

On Tuesday, August 29, the US District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled that the SEC did not provide a “consistent justification” for rejecting Grayscale’s request to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). This decision brings the asset management firm closer to offering a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US. The price of Bitcoin reacted positively to this development, breaking above and beyond the $26,000 mark. According to CoinGecko data, the premier cryptocurrency is currently valued at $27,136, reflecting a 3.8% price gain in the past week. Coinbase (COIN) Rally 15% After Grayscale’s Win The value of Coinbase’s stock COIN stood at $84.70 by the close of the trading session on Tuesday, representing a 15.2% increase from the day’s opening price. The crypto company’s stock surged by nearly $13 per share, climbing from $73.5 per share to almost $86 during the day, according to Coinbase’s stock information. Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, became publicly listed on Nasdaq in 2021. Related Reading: Bitcoin Insider Trading Suspicions Take Root Following Grayscale Win, What’s Happening? This price jump is believed to have been triggered by the success of Grayscale’s appeal against the United States SEC, as mentioned above. While the court’s decision doesn’t automatically convert the asset manager’s Bitcoin Trust to a spot ETF, it is still perceived as a significant milestone in launching the financial product in the North American country. If spot Bitcoin ETFs receive approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Coinbase could become one of the biggest winners due to its surveillance-sharing agreements with some applicants, including the world’s largest asset manager, Blackrock. These arrangements aim to mitigate potential market manipulation risks – a concern raised by the SEC after the initial Bitcoin ETF submissions. Marathon and Riot Witness Surge In Stocks Price Coinbase was not the only cryptocurrency company that enjoyed the ripple effect of Grayscale’s legal triumph. Bitcoin mining companies, like Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT), also felt a positive impact on their stock prices. Favorable judgments, such as the latest Grayscale victory, often boost the interest and optimism of investors in the cryptocurrency industry and crypto-related products. As a result, companies operating in the cryptocurrency space, including Bitcoin mining firms, are likely to receive increased attention from investors. Related Reading: Renowned Economist Explains Why Grayscale’s Win Is Not Good For Bitcoin Price According to TradingView, the value of MARA soared by about 30% on Tuesday, closing at $13.69 per share by the end of the day’s trading session. Likewise, the RIOT price experienced an 18.2% rally, climbing from $10.39 per share to almost $12.3 at the end of the day. As of this writing, the Marathon Digital Holdings stock is trading at $12.94 per share, reflecting a 5.2% decrease since the opening of Wednesday’s (30th of August) trading session. Meanwhile, Riot Platforms’ stock has currently declined by 4% to trade at $11.8 per share.

This technical formation occurs when the price fluctuations of an asset are confined within converging trendlines, creating a triangle-like shape on the chart. Traders interpret this pattern as a period of consolidation, often preceding a substantial price movement. As Cardano’s price coils within the confines of the triangle pattern, traders are bracing for a potential decisive breakout in the days to come. The prevailing trend, in this case, supports the notion of a likely price ascent, and that is to make it to the $0.3 region. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Records Surprising 15% Rally – What’s Behind It? However, market sentiment hints at the possibility of sellers breaching the bottom trendline, leading to an extension of the ongoing corrective trend. A report suggests that a retreat below the pattern’s support trendline might trigger an approximate 8.5% downturn. Current Scenario And ADA Price Analysis At present, Cardano’s price stands at $0.265, as reported by CoinGecko. The cryptocurrency has experienced a modest 1.2% gain over the past 24 hours and a 3.0% increase in value over the course of the last week. Nevertheless, the current triangle pattern indicates that these gains might be overshadowed by a potentially more significant movement. As of today, the market cap of ADA stood at $9.2 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Reflecting on its history, Cardano reached its all-time high price of $3.09 on Sept. 2, 2021, accompanied by a market cap of around $95 billion on the same day. Notably, a separate report underscores the consistent need for increased demand for Cardano in order to align with its historical price levels. This necessity arises due to the cryptocurrency’s unique monetary expansion model, which introduces a fixed rate of 0.3% every five days for circulating the remaining tokens from the ‘reserve.’ This approach effectively curtails the rate at which ADA is injected into the supply over time. Future Possibilities And Investor Prospects Analysts speculate that the current ADA price could potentially present an opportunity for investors to secure substantial gains, if the layer-1 blockchain manages to match its previous demand. This projection rests on the assumption that historical demand for ADA could surge once again.
