42431293,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1PPh,1576350000,The Great Crypto Experiment Continues,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Andy Bromberg is the co-founder and president of CoinList, a platform for token sales. CoinList is also launching a cryptocurrency exchange, and provides compliance and developer engagement services to crypto projects.      Compared to the 2017-18 hype cycle, this was a quiet year for the crypto markets. There was no tidal wave of institutional money or cascade of mass adoption. Regulators gave encouraging crypto guidance while also putting Libra and projects like Kik and Telegram in their crosshairs. And for our business and the larger token sale space, we continued to see investors eager to back quality projects.      In other words, the crypto experiment continued.      In 2019, we saw startups tweak token-based fundraising models in new directions. For instance, Algorand ran a Dutch Auction sale on our platform where participants set and paid a uniform, market-determined price per token to ensure fairness and transparency – some of the core tenets of the project. There were projects like Blockstack that were the first to conduct a Reg A+ token sale. And, we saw projects starting to conduct Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) in order to provide immediate liquidity for investors.    Public sales are increasingly used primarily as a mechanism to distribute tokens.    In other words, token sales survived the crypto winter. In 2017 and early 2018, public token sales were focused on raising large chunks of capital for projects. But based on what we’re seeing today, public sales are increasingly used primarily as a mechanism to distribute tokens to a broad array of stakeholders, with the capital raise being a secondary consideration.      But a lot of the continued viability of crypto projects and token sales alike hinges on the SEC and other regulators.    The crypto community got some mixed messages from DC in 2019. The government went after Libra, fined EOS, filed a lawsuit against Kik, and blocked Telegram from distributing its token. Some members of government were more supportive of crypto – including SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who called forhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-commissioner-supports-creation-non-101500697.html a safe harbor for crypto projects, so tokens meeting specified criteria could be traded more freely, enabling a more open crypto ecosystem. As we approach the new decade, this – and other encouraging signals — give me confidence in the long-term viability and success of token sales.    What does that mean for 2020?      Just as our industry matures and projects experiment with different token sale mechanisms, we’ll see many live network launches – including many projects that raised money on our platform. These live networks will be a proving ground for even more novel crypto ideas.      On the institutional side, don’t expect to see a “wave” of new money come crashing in, but building off of 2019, we expect a gradual, slow-rising tide of institutional capital.      Finally, we’ll continue to see the industry working with the SEC and other regulators to provide clarity, with the aim of avoiding any more companies receiving punishments of the sort meted out this year.      Most of all, as ever, the experiment will continue.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALGO | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Andy Bromberg,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/14/the-great-crypto-experiment-continues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/30ee7203388343f3523f7100b47959402ac4ac1a-1634x1634.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431290,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1PTh,1576344968,Change Won't Happen With Chairman Clayton Around: Kristin Smith,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Kristin Smith is director of external affairs for the Blockchain Association.      The Blockchain Association was founded just over a year ago as crypto’s permanent advocate in Washington D.C. By bringing together disparate projects, investors, exchanges and regulatory bodies, the Association is working to build a comprehensive framework for understanding these emerging financial technologies.      For Kristin Smith, the group's director of external affairs, public policy cannot wait for legislators or courts to decide on the issues. Blockchain represents the next competitive front for U.S. business and needs an independent organization to agitate for legislative clarity. What follows is a lightly edited conversation with Smith about the biggest regulatory shifts of 2019, and what they might mean for the future of crypto.      Kristin, what were the big moments for you this year?      The Token Taxonomy Act, which was reintroduced by a bipartisan group to Congress in April. It finally addressed the various concerns in the industry have such as how individual state laws will interact with the bill. It showed that Congress might play a role in fixing the regulatory issues.      Libra had a super interesting impact. All of the sudden members of Congress realized “Holy cow! This crypto stuff is a real thing. There are real companies that are trying to enter this space.” So that skyrocketed the level of attention in Washington’s political circles. Because of Libra, Congress has really shifted their concern and is engaged in figuring out how they can take the lead. We need a Congress that wants to make sure that the U.S. continues to be strong, and that the dollar continues to be strong. How do we not necessarily resist, with the exception of FEMA, visit Congress like, But how do we embrace the technology in a way that still meets public policy goals. We've come a tremendous way in the past year, but we have a long way to go.      Is Congress starting to understand blockchain and crypto better?      Initially, there was interest amongst a couple of forward-thinking lawmakers looking to carve out a niche for themselves by focusing on something nobody else was. We were able to get the attention of a few junior members in the house. But now we've got the attention of the more senior members in both the House and Senate, who are thinking about how to make sure that appropriate regulation is in place. We used to have to beg to get attention, and now, members are coming to us. They’re asking, what can we do to help these problems?      Were you surprised by Congress’s reaction to Libra?      I wasn't surprised, actually. Facebook is out of favor with lawmakers on Capitol Hill for multiple reasons relating to the election and privacy issues. That hadn’t previously understood that Facebook makes money by selling users’ information. I think it really came as a surprise to Congress that Facebook has not been popular from the beginning.      Lawmakers are beginning to realize they can't do much to stop it, if Facebook wants to do it.      I was surprised by the reaction from Rep. Maxine Waters [the chair of the House Financial Services Committee]. She immediately, without asking any questions, called for a halt the project. There's still some concern among members, but we're also starting to see some who want to let the project grow and let innovation happen. Lawmakers are beginning to realize they can't do much to stop it, if Facebook wants to do it. But, yeah, it was pretty rough rollout. I don't know if Facebook should have done a little bit more advanced work before making the announcement.      To some extent, Kik’s ongoing legal fight with the SEC is less about whether Kin is deemed a security, but rather how Ted Livingston [CEO of Kik] and the company address combative regulators. Does the Blockchain Association have a view on how Kik is challenging securities law?      Kik is not a member of the Association, but we’re watching the case very closely. We think it has potential to impact the way that other projects and exchanges interpret securities laws. In any case, it’s a very important case. Kik started this Defend Crypto fund, and put about $5 million into it. About a month or so later, they decided to take that $5 million investment back and give the remaining sum to the Blockchain Association to manage other projects that are unrelated to Kik. We’re grateful for that responsibility.      It's really difficult and confusing to know how and when these securities laws apply. There isn't any clarity. Also, these laws are incredibly expensive [to comply with]. Small projects that might have a good idea are not able to retain lawyers to help them. We can change the policy to provide clarity. But that process takes time. You either get something to Congress, you have a regulator schedule a rule, or, as we’ve seen with the investment contract analysis defense, figure things out through the judicial process. Have the courts interpret policies that way.      There were a few notable settlements this year, including the conclusion of the SEC’s investigation into Block.one’s initial token sale. It seems like the penalty for not disclosing information to investors or registering with regulators is being worked out in real time. Do you think Block.one’s settlement provided clarity for the rest of the industry?      The interesting thing about that settlement is the SEC didn't go after the EOS token as it exists today. They were looking at the token used initially to raise funds. And they’re doing the same thing in Kik’s case. The case is about the token distribution, not about whether or not Kin today is a security. Similar to how ether is not a security today, though it may have been at the time of its initial sale. So we have a situation where we know that you can get to a place where these tokens are not securities, but it's still not clear how to get there without having this period of time where something is a security. These cases could play out in multiple ways. But it's not helpful for the SEC to look back and be like, “Well, that offering, you know, wasn't registered, that was wrong,” because there's still no clear pathway on how to get from security to commodity without having to go through that process.      I think Block.one was smart. The settlement they were offered was relatively small compared to how much money they raised. But it doesn't lend itself to a pathway forward for projects that are looking to launch. It almost created a problem by pointing out that there is no way to get there.      What projects are you funding with Kik’s Defend Crypto money?      At this point, we haven’t publicly used the funds for any sort of specific cases. We we have the money set aside for when things come up. As of now, there hasn't been a situation where somebody is in the cross hairs with the SEC and needs support.      Will the SEC pursue more actions in 2020?      There are always ongoing investigations. I don't think that will go away. We may start to see some decisions, especially with Telegram and Kik later next year, that could potentially clarify things in a way that will either be good or bad.      Predictions for 2020?      I think we're gonna start to see legislative movement. As long as Chairman Clayton at the SEC is still around, I don't think we'll see a whole lot of progress at the SEC. But I do think we're going to see legislation or bills introduced. We’re working on bills on the Senate side that we're hoping to get introduced. We'll see more legislative action as a way to ultimately solve the problem or put pressure on the agencies to take matters into their own hands. It will be a turning point for Congress when we see more consumers starting to use crypto on a regular basis. I feel like we're on the cusp of getting some of these things out there, so that it's not just people Hodling bitcoin in their coinbase accounts, but actually using it to interact with services online. When we start to see more everyday users, that will be a tipping point for Congress, because up until now, it’s been a niche interest. Libra is a pathway for them to do this. It could be a real use case for millions of people to move money around the world.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/14/change-wont-happen-with-chairman-clayton-around-kristin-smith,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4befbaefe5249a3337573e247d0746142b2aee3b-1920x2560.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431289,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1PHh,1576337400,Lessons From the First Digital Gold Boom,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. J.P. Koning is the creator of the Moneyness blog, which covers economics, finance, and fintech.      2019 was the year that Facebook introduced Libra, a blockchain-based payments network that will be the ""internet of money.""      This seems revolutionary, but Libra is actually a revamped version of a much older payments model. In 1996, Douglas Jackson, an oncologist and fan of the gold standard, founded a payments system called e-gold. Backed one-to-one by reserves of the yellow metal, the e-gold system allowed users all around the world to make instant private electronic payments.      Unfortunately, e-gold ran into problems with regulators. In 2009, just as bitcoin was taking off, Jackson had to close shop. It remains to be seen if Libra – e-gold 2.0 – will be able to navigate the difficulties its predecessor floundered on many years ago.    With cryptocurrencies having captured everyone’s imagination, we often forget that the digital gold boom of the 2000s was the first digital currency revolution. Jackson's initial success with e-gold encouraged a swarm of copycats: GoldMoney, eBullion, OSGold, INTGold, Pecunix, 1mdc, and more. These currencies were swapped on hundreds of digital gold exchanges located around the globe. The industry even had its own magazine, DGC Magazine, and trade association, the Global Digital Currency Association. At its peakhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/amp/articles/2006-01-08/gold-rush in 2005, e-gold had around 1.2 million accounts with transactions totalling $1.5 billion. It was almost as large as PayPal.    The heyday of the digital gold industry has long since passed. But the similarities between Jackson’s e-gold and Facebook’s Libra are remarkable. E-gold relied on a unique supra-national unit of account, gold, as the base language for expressing values. Likewise, Libra will use its own artificial unit of account – the Libra – composed of a cocktail of national currencies.      Libra will establish a stable value for its Libra tokens by backing them 1:1 with underlying reserve assets such as bank deposits and government securities. E-gold operated on the same principles. It kept a 100 percent reserve of physical gold in vaults located in places like London and Dubai. These reserves were regularly audited and users could monitor their status by going to e-gold's website.      The way that users will interact with the Libra reserve comes straight from the e-gold playbook. An e-gold user could neither deposit gold to the e-gold reserve nor withdraw gold from it. Permission to ""bail"" physical bars into or out of the system was limited to a network of third-party exchange agents such as The Bullion Exchange, IceGold, and The Denver Gold Exchange. These wholesalers in turn provided the public with e-gold by offering to buy or sell it at a spread.      The same goes for Libra. Users won't be able to directly interface with Libra reserves. Rather, a network of authorized resellers will withdraw or deposit large amounts of fiat in and out of the reserve. The public will be able to buy or sell Libras at third-party venues like cryptocurrency exchanges.      In addition to adopting supranational units and similar distribution models, the two networks are both ""open"" systems. In Libra’s case, ""open access"" means that ""anybody with an internet connection"" can participate. The protocol ""does not link accounts to a real-world identity"" which means users can use the network pseudonymously and create multiple accounts.      Likewise, anyone with an internet connection could open an e-gold account. Users went by bogus names like “Mickey Mouse,” “Donald Duck,” and “Anonymous Man” and could have as many accounts as they liked.      So what killed e-gold? And will this also cripple Libra? Many regulators worry that a separate Libra unit of account threatens national monetary sovereignty. But in e-gold's case, it was never gold-denominated money that attracted regulatory censure. Nor were regulators concerned with the distribution model or the adequacy of e-gold's reserves.      Jackson had always assumed that e-gold was neither a bank nor a money services business. Thus he never bothered conforming to money laundering rules set out in the Bank Secrecy Act, including registering his business with the US Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Unfortunately, by allowing for pseudonymous access and omitting FinCEN-compliant money laundering controls, e-gold became a haven for carders--criminals who traffic in stolen credit card numbers.      This brought e-gold to the attention of the FBI. In 2007, Jackson and his fellow owners were indicted by the Department of Justice for conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and other charges. As a condition of Jackson's 2008 plea deal, he had to bring e-gold in line with regulations. This meant registering it with FinCEN and implementing an anti-money laundering plan. In a blog post, Jackson promised that e-gold would enforce a ""one-human being/one e-gold User"" rule. All third-party exchanges would have to be compliant too.      It wasn't to be. As felons, Jackson and his colleagues were prohibited from applying for a money transmitter license, and so e-gold had to shut itself down. The actual e-gold model, as set out in Jackson's plea deal, remains intact. It only has to conform to best practices.    The lesson is that even when regulations lack clarity, the issuer is still responsible for compliance.    Indeed, Jackson continues to market the intellectual property for e-gold in the form of Better Money.      The basic e-gold model may be a sound one, but Libra doesn't just want to take up where Jackson left off. Jackson's plan was to pivot to a one human/one e-gold user rule. Libra, on the other hand, will allow users to hold multiple addresses not linked to their true identities.      David Marcus, the co-founder of Libra, intimates that this will be compensated for by the fact that the blockchain transactions are public, thus allowing law enforcement and regulators to conduct ""their own analysis of on-chain activity."" Customer identification at third party onramps or offramps may be able to help law enforcement fill in the dots and apprehend criminals.      It may be that Libra's rendition of e-gold proves to be an effective way to guard against carders and money launderers. And having one of the largest companies in the world behind it, Facebook, gives it the heft that e-gold never had. But the lesson learned from Jackson’s experience is that even though regulations lack clarity, the issuer is still responsible for compliance. Better to check in with the regulator before building a new payments system, not after. Libra is clearly cognizant of this, having approached regulators fairly early on in the process.      It remains to be seen if regulators will buy Libra’s “open access” model. Back in the 2000s, publicly-viewable blockchains didn’t exist. They may be more receptive in 2019. If it is allowed to go ahead, the repercussions could be significant. Not only would it create a new e-gold. Other large financial institutions would be interested in shifting their payment models in the direction that Libra is taking.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/14/lessons-from-the-first-digital-gold-boom,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/848e4039acb9e648055a4ed98ab269337328c108-456x346.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431280,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1P9h,1576332000,Meet Crypto’s New Best Friend: Fiat,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Halsey Minor started CNET, and was involved in a string of companies. Today he leads Live Planet VR and the VideoCoin Network, video infrastructure for the blockchain-enabled internet.        I started in the crypto industry in 2013 launching Uphold, the payment service and exchange that created one of the first stablecoins. It still allows users to buy and trade bitcoin and 15 fiat currencies today. At the time, Coinbase required traders to sell bitcoin and send the money back to their bank accounts. It had no USD service. We wanted to give traders the ability to convert bitcoin to their native fiat currencies and back again without leaving the ecosystem and to send funds all the way back to their banks. Back then, holding fiat “stablecoins” on a service like ours was not well liked in a bitcoin-or-nothing world.      In 2019, as traders sought more pricing stability, we saw the rise of Tether and its many competitors. Stablecoins have become the solution to move fiat among exchanges without using banks directly. Fiat trading on blockchain has exploded and US dollar-backed stablecoins have attracted more than $4.5 billion of investment. What this proves is that fiat and crypto were never enemies. They were complementary in any effective trading ecosystem, and both have prospered.      For convenience, crypto-users need to be able to use their bank accounts to pay for products and services. If, instead, you force them to open an exchange account and to use some new, volatile form of money with low liquidity just to use your service – then you’ve created significant friction. If blockchain-based businesses are to succeed, they must be as convenient to use as non-blockchain services.      At VideoCoin, a company building a decentralized video infrastructure platform, we asked ourselves a simple question. If Paramount Pictures or 20th Century Fox were a VideoCoin customer and they wanted to spend $100,000 a month on our video encoding service, would they be willing to open an exchange account, hire a trader to avoid driving the price up at acquisition, and then deposit funds whose value on our services would fluctuate every minute of every day? You see the problem, here.      Our competitors at Amazon Web Services let customers use a regular bank account in all its forms – credit card, wire transfer, ACH, and so on. These methods are simple to use and the value they deposit does not fluctuate significantly from moment to moment. Even though we are building a service that is dramatically lower priced, the payment friction would be so great it would substantially hurt our ability to compete.      We collaborated with a third-party (which we’ve yet to announce) to create a fiat-based blockchain connected to banks. This provides access to traditional payment methods like credit cards and ACH while keeping all of the inherent benefits of blockchain. Even the gas – the fuel necessary to do any transaction on a blockchain network – is fiat-based creating the first tokenized fiat blockchain supporting smart contracts and traditional payment methods. This model allows 20th Century Fox to pay in dollars and our workers (data centers) to be compensated in dollars upon completion of verified work. No friction, just lower cost.      Tokens used as payments are not competitive with fiat when it comes to reaching customers outside of the crypto ecosystem. Unfortunately, almost all of the business world today lives outside of the crypto ecosystem and they do not have access to crypto exchanges, but they do have credit cards. We need to make VideoCoin as easy to use as any other competitive service, if not easier.    Embracing fiat payments is not capitulation, it’s the first step toward making the businesses we envision real.    At VideoCoin, our utility token VID plays an incredibly useful function in securing and powering the network, ensuring the most qualified network operators are serving customer needs. The VID token does not act as a payment mechanism. Instead, it’s a reputational staking mechanism for building the global infrastructure that runs the worker nodes on the VideoCoin Network. Miners are continuously selected by the VideoCoin Network services algorithm as operators to process video files based on three factors: quoted price, number of staked tokens, and performance. This drives the least expensive and highest quality network operators to perform—the best rise to the top. Staking is the perfect use for tokens in a utility model. Instead of burdening the network with payment friction, our tokens power the network to function securely and in return, workers receive staking rewards in fiat.      This means customers of the VideoCoin Network pay in fiat, the data centers get paid in fiat, and those staking are paid in fiat plus a small staking reward in VID tokens. Reward tokens are automatically purchased by the Network from exchanges, at the then-prevailing price, when a job is started so stakers end up with fiat they can send to their bank and a small additional amount in tokens.      Just as Tether, Paxos Standard and other stablecoins have made it easier to use exchanges, trade and move money into and out of the banking system, so too can a fiat-integrated blockchain liberate crypto from payment friction, which is a business killer. If crypto startups want to take market share from traditional businesses, they need to allow for the convenience of fiat-based payments.    In 2020, those who have come to this understanding will be poised to compete outside of the narrow crypto domain. These are the very people we want to engage when the VideoCoin Network reaches full system release in May 2020https://www.videocoin.io/roadmap/.

42431282,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1P7h,1576319448,Myths and Realities: Sentiment Analysis for Crypto Assets,"Jesus Rodriguez is the CTO and co-founder of IntoTheBlock, a platform focused on enabling an intelligent infrastructure for the crypto markets, as well as chief scientist of AI firm Invector Labs and an active investor, speaker and author in crypto and artificial intelligence. This article originally appeared in CoinDesk's Institutional Crypto newsletter.      One of the established beliefs in the cryptocurrency market is its susceptibility to news and social media. Like any other nascent and still irrational financial market, unexpected developments captured in news or social media tend to impact price. As a result, there is increasing interest in leveraging machine learning techniques such as sentiment analysis to detect possible correlations with the price of cryptocurrencies and digital tokens. Despite its importance, most attempts to leverage sentiment analysis are too basic to output any tangible intelligence and quite often produce misleading results.      The challenges of efficiently leveraging sentiment analysis to evaluate the behavior of an asset are not unique to the crypto space. Producing true insights based on textual sentiment is a very difficult task that, most of the time, requires natural language processing (NLP) models optimized for a specific financial domain. Large quantitative hedge funds use armies of machine learning experts to train NLP models in a very specific task like analyzing earning reports in order to get an edge in a medium frequency trade. Efficiently leveraging sentiment analysis for crypto assets requires machine learning depth and rigor.      To understand that statement, let’s start by diving a bit deeper into the characteristics of sentiment analysis methods.      A gentle introduction to sentiment analysis      In Act II, Scene II of the famous play Richelieu; Or the Conspiracy, British playwright Edward Bulwer-Lytton coined a phrase that has transcended generations: “The pen is mightier than the sword.” Centuries after, that famous quote brilliantly encapsulates the importance of sentiment analysis. Emotions in textual communication are sometimes more conducive to actions than physical actions themselves.      Conceptually, sentiment analysis is a subdiscipline of NLP that focuses on identifying the affective states of textual communications. Contrary to popular beliefs, sentiment analysis is not a single technique but rather a subdiscipline of the deep learning space that covers different types of affection detection in textual data. From that perspective, there are several types of sentiment analysis that could be relevant in the context of crypto-asset intelligence:    Polarity Analysis: This type of sentiment analysis ranks textual sentiment in positive, negative and neutral. For instance, the sentence “the bitcoin price rally has reenergized the market” would likely be classified as positive by most models.  Emotion/Tone Analysis: Instead of an overall qualifier for the text, this type of analysis centers on scoring the different types of emotions present in a particular text. Emotions such as sadness, happiness or anger are a common focus of emotion analysis algorithms. For instance, the sentence “this bitcoin rally is crazy,” will show high levels of excitement and joy.  Aspect Sentiment Analysis: This type of sentiment analysis focuses on interpreting the sentiment about specific subjects within a sentence rather than a sentence as a whole. For instance, in the sentence “Bakkt futures are a major milestone for the bitcoin market,” aspect analysis will determine the sentiment related to “Bakkt futures” instead of the complete sentence.    Looking at the previous list, we can clearly see the benefits of sentiment analysis for crypto assets. However, there are also plenty of challenges that should be considered before venturing into using these types of techniques. Contextualization, subjectivity, irony or even bad grammar are among the factors that can easily trick the best NLP algorithms.      Sentiment analysis for crypto assets      Crypto is a nascent asset class that is still vulnerable to the irrationality of financial markets and the lack of proper disclosure channels. From that perspective, it is only logical to assume NLP techniques such as sentiment analysis can identify alpha or smart beta generator factors to predict the behavior of crypto assets. Reality is a bit different.      When applying sentiment analysis to crypto assets, we are likely to encounter two main types of challenges:    Limitations of mainstream NLP technologies when applied to a domain-specific problem such as crypto asset analysis.  Incorrect assumptions about how sentiment is reflected in news and social media.    The first challenge can almost be seen as an unexpected side effect of the rapid growth of NLP technologies. Today, it is relatively easy for a developer to incorporate sentiment analysis into applications using simple APIs that don’t require any deep learning expertise.      While NLP APIs can be effective analyzing the sentiment of a generic sentence, they perform extremely poorly when trying to extrapolate domain-specific knowledge of a specific sentence. For instance, analyzing the sentence “a bitcoin ETF approval could be imminent” requires NLP models that are specialized in the semantics of market-specific terminology and that are able to extrapolate sentiment at a more granular level than from just a sentence.      The second challenge is related to misconceptions about how sentiment is reflected in news and social media commentary. As a source of intelligence, news can be highly informative but quite useless when comes to sentiment analysis. The reason is obvious: the sentiment in well-written news should trend around neutral. Social media behaves in the exact opposite way. Conversations about cryptocurrencies in Twitter or Telegram tend to contain relevant sentiment but, for the most part, are based on a reaction to public material information, which means that they are unlikely to generate any informational edge. Additionally, social media threads tend to be noisy and relatively subjective, which can produce misleading sentiment analysis results.      From a purely technological standpoint, building effective sentiment analysis models for crypto assets requires models trained in the terminology of crypto markets, but that also analyze news as sources of information and social media feeds as amplifiers of sentiment. However, if we get past this technological challenge, we are now faced with one of the biggest psychological misconceptions when comes to sentiment analysis models in the crypto space.      The sentiment-market impact fallacy      The sentiment-market impact fallacy describes a phenomenon that is notorious or irrational, such as nascent financial markets in which investors assume a direct correlation between a sentiment score and a price movement. To explain this behavioral economics dynamic, let’s imagine that you are using an analytics tool that analyze the sentiment of recent bitcoin tweets. Psychologically, most investors are inclined to interpret the sentiment as a leading indicator based on the following rules:    If the sentiment is positive that’s a bullish indicator for the price of bitcoin.  If the sentiment is negative that’s a bearish indicator for the price of bitcoin.    However, if your model is analyzing public, material information, the sentiment should be interpreted as a lagging indicator following some non-intuitive rules:    If the sentiment is positive and the price of bitcoin does not go up, that is a bearish signal.  If the sentiment is negative and the price of bitcoin does not go down, that is a bullish signal.    Being aware of sentiment-price bias positions sentiment analysis not as a leading indicator but as an often relevant factor in a trading strategy.      From sentiment analysis to market impact analysis      From an informational standpoint, the crypto market is noisy and full of unexpected events. In terms of sentiment analysis, that combination of factors is a nightmare. Instead of narrowly focusing on sentiment analysis, we should probably develop a more holistic approach. A sentiment-market impact indicator would be a combination of polarity (negative, positive, neutral), emotion (anxious, excited, sad…) and aspect-based (topics, entities…) analysis over long periods of time. This approach would require the training of models specialized in the dynamics of crypto assets to evaluate the sentiment in the context of specific market conditions.      The idea of sentiment-market impact models is conceptually trivial: quantify the impact that combinations of sentiment, emotions and topics can have on a crypto asset during specific market conditions. Part of the beauty of this approach is that it doesn’t have to be completely unsupervised like most sentiment models today; it can be trained on domain-specific knowledge of crypto markets. For instance, we could train a model to learn that positive articles about Chinese investment in crypto can have a positive impact in a market that had been relatively bearish for the last week. The core principle of sentiment-market impact analysis models would be to contextualize the knowledge of sentiment models to the specifics of the crypto market.      Sentiment analysis is likely to keep sparking flashy headlines in the crypto market. However, in order to be effective, the models require deeper machine learning rigor and the building of knowledge based on the specific dynamics of crypto markets. As the markets evolve, we are likely to see a transition from plain sentiment analysis techniques to more holistic market impact models that quantify the relevance of specific topics in the behavior of the crypto markets.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/14/myths-and-realities-sentiment-analysis-for-crypto-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d39b55886a610f55a5baffb8221cb2bd7415eb3-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
