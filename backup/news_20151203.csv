42378436,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iCgP,1449175550,Fidelity Charitable: Investors Want to Use Bitcoin to Do Good,"Fidelity Charitable became the latest major US charity to accept bitcoin this November when it added the digital currency as an eligible asset for its donor-advised accounts.  With the move, Fidelity Charitable joins an expanding list of nonprofits that have opted to accept bitcoin donations, including American Red Cross, Greenpeace USA, Save the Children and United Way, among others. Like these organizations, Fidelity reports that customer acceptance and interest in the idea were the motivating factors behind the move.  In interview, Fidelity Charitable senior vice president Matt Nash affirmed that the organization has a vested interest in listening to its customers and making its offerings as ""broad"" as possible.  Nash told CoinDesk:  ""What we’re finding is that for more Americans, as more people use and invest in digital currencies, they’ll tap those resources to do good. We had had some inquiries from some advisors and we looked into it.""  Nash was unable to provide statistics on how many users had so far taken advantage of the offering, but did state that last year’s decision by the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to classify bitcoin as property proved pivotal to the move.  ""We take in a lot of appreciated assets from securities in private companies to things like real estate, and we felt like, with the IRS evaluating it as property, it is now similar to other assets taking in,"" he continued.  Fidelity Investments helped consult on the decision, according to Nash, providing compliance and legal services so that its charity arm could move forward with the offering.  However, Nash was unable to comment on the larger strategy of the financial giant, which has to date only moved to sponsor digital currency conferences and industry events.  Initiating giving  To donate bitcoin, Nash said investors must call to set up an account. Bitcoin funds are then sent to Fidelity Charitable via bitcoin services firm Coinbase, where they are converted into fiat currency and deposited into the customer’s account.  When asked how the process was different from simply donating cash, Nash responded that the organization users a similar donation process for stock, in which the asset is sold and proceeds are deposited in accounts.  ""From a donor's perspective, they're donating bitcoin,"" Nash said. ""The charity won’t hold bitcoin. Many charities don’t have the capability to handle assets other than cash.""  Donors must also go through checks, at which point assets are vetted to ensure they haven’t been used for money laundering, according to Nash. However, he said, despite the propensity for cybercriminals to use bitcoins, he said no additional checks are provided for these assets.  As for how the offering could evolve as bitcoin becomes even more widely used, Nash said the offering could be ""scaled up"" to include automation, concluding:  ""Our mission is all about making giving simple.""

42378432,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iCYr,1449163424,Boston University Researchers Explore Bitcoin in Conflict Zones,"Could digital currencies improve financial conditions in war-torn countries? Boston University's Center for Finance, Law and Policy (CFLP) has convened a task force to explore whether they can.  The research effort, which began earlier this year, follows on the heels of an October 2013 report on remittances in regions of beset by strife and turmoil. That report had a particular focus on the Middle East and Africa, and did not analyze digital currencies.  From Commonwealth central bankers to major credit card networks, digital currencies have been cited by many observers as a possible game-changer for the world of remittances, despite pushback from industry incumbents.  Organizations such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have also begun looking at blockchain implementations as a means of developing new payment systems for the unbanked.  The task force is being led by Daivi Rodima-Taylor and William W Grimes of the CFLP, an interdisciplinary research initiative focused on financial issues. The CFLP recently hosted a panelhttp://www.bu.edu/bucflp/files/2015/10/CFLP-Digital-Currencies-and-Remittances-Panel.pdf that explored bitcoin and the blockchain and how they might fit into the broader world of formal and informal remittance flows.  Moderated by Circle’s John Beccia, panelists included Counterparty community manager Chris DeRose, Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman attorney Marco Santori and entrepreneur Joshua Unseth.  Rodima-Taylor believes that in regions where financial infrastructure, particularly central banks, aren’t functioning, digital currencies as a technology offered a means to enhance what is already a diverse ecosystem of remittance methods.  She told CoinDesk:  ""Financial technology innovations such as digital currencies have offered productive solutions for the remittance sector for some time now, and have a potential to revolutionize transnational remittance transfers particularly in fragile and post-conflict contexts.""  According to Grimes, the task force assembled by the CFLP ""seeks to understand the potential for mobile and digital technologies to reduce costs and increase efficiency of money transfer to developing countries, as well as any potential legal or political downsides"", and will focus on other forms of electronic remittance in addition to digital currencies like bitcoin.  Remittance in digital form  According to the mission statement for the new task force, digital currencies like bitcoin ""are creating additional opportunities for more efficient remittance transfers"" yet, at the same time, ""create certain risks and challenges"".  The statement outlines how the research will take place against the backdrop of a broader look at digital money mechanisms in conflict nations, explaining:  ""The Task Force research examines the emerging opportunities for social as well as technological innovation within digital currency communities and networks, and within emerging technological and institutional hybrids as digital currencies engage with various forms of mobile and traditional banking.""  Rodima-Taylor told CoinDesk that, according to her past research, the growth of private remittance methods often comes ""amid a breakdown of formal financial institutions and poorly functioning governments"".  Pointing to examples like hawala, a trust-based payment system dating back to the Middle Ages, Rodima-Taylor said that informal money flows “draw upon existing social institutions and culturally embedded solidarity networks”.  She continued:  ""In fragile situations such as Somalia where a systemic risk of anti-money-laundering remains, digital currencies become especially important as offering potentially secure and legible alternatives for remittance transfers. These decentralized and peer-to-peer systems do not rely on central banking infrastructure, making them suitable for these chaotic environments.""  Conflict breeds innovation  Rodima-Taylor also cited past examples, including the development of informal remittance channels in Somalia in the 1990s amid the region’s long-running civil conflict, as ways in which new technology is opportunistically seized upon to help solve societal challenge – in this case, the movement of money.  She continued:  ""As a result, conflict-ridden Somalia developed one of the most advanced telecommunication infrastructures in Africa at that time, demonstrating how conflict can fuel technological adaptations and competition.""  Adaptation amid regional strife, Rodima-Taylor continued, has been seen to lead to scenarios in which mixtures of private and more public form of remittance take shape.  ""As the cases of post-conflict Afghanistan and Somalia have shown, local creative combinations of existing remittance institutions and novel technological opportunities can harness adaptive potentials even in the contexts of widespread devastation,"" she told CoinDesk. ""They can also produce novel opportunities for formal sector engagement and result in viable 'hybrid' arrangements.""  Low adoption casts doubt  Grimes told CoinDesk that, for now, digital currencies haven’t reached the scale of adoption that would make them a clear cost-reducer in a remittance context.  The need for individuals to purchase a digital currency using a government-backed currency and then send that digital currency, he said, entails an added step that adds additional expenditure and risk.  ""For the moment, the main problem for digital currencies in the remittance space is that none are widely used in developing countries themselves, so any use for remittances must depend on two exchange transactions, which means both transaction costs and currency risks,"" Grimes said. ""And given the volatility of the value of bitcoin, it remains somewhat problematic as a store of value.""  Should broader adoption happen, he continued, the potential advantages of using a digital currency to remit funds could become more apparent:  ""A big question for digital currencies in remittances, as with all remittance methods, remains cost. If and when digital currencies become more widely used in the developing world and societies get used to them, they may be an important new vehicle for addressing the needs of those societies.""

42378424,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iCSZ,1449145203,Blythe Masters Turned Down Barclays to Stay at Blockchain Startup,"Blythe Masters turned down an offer to run Barclays' investment bank to stay with her blockchain technology startup Digital Asset Holdings, Reuters reported yesterday.  The report  , citing an unnamed source, said Barclays boss Jes Staley pitched his former JP Morgan colleague Masters to head the unit late next year.  But Masters rebuffed the offer, saying she is ""fully committed"" to her startup, which plans to use blockchain technology to cut down settlement and clearing times for a variety of asset classes.  Masters told Reuters:  ""I can't think of a better person than Jes Staley, nor a more venerable institution than Barclays, but I am in mid-flight at Digital Asset and fully committed to what we are doing.""  Masters is one of the most powerful figures on Wall Street operating in the financial technology space. She was the former global head of commodities at JP Morgan and is widely credited for devising the credit default swap.  Bloomberg's Gadfly, commenting on the Reuters revelation, noted that this could mark a turning point for finance. Gadfly managing editor Edward Evans wrote:  ""For financiers, the attraction of making a fortune in tech is now greater than the lure of running one of Europe's pre-eminent investment banks.""  Barclays has been rocked by scandal recently, earning it the biggest-ever fine imposed by the UK's financial regulator, at £72 million.  Staley started in the top job at Barclays two days ago. His predecessor Antony Jenkins was fired in July after disagreements with the board over cuts at its investment banking division.
