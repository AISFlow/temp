In a new interview with Bloomberg TV, BlackRock chief Larry Fink said that he's a ""big believer"", but that the current market today is primarily focused on speculation.

Fink said in the interview:  ""Related to cryptocurrencies, I'm a big believer in the potential of what a cryptocurrency can do. You see huge opportunities, but what we're talking about today, it's much more of a speculative platform, people are speculating on it.""  Fink added that, thus far, his firm hasn't seen much interest from clients beyond ""some speculative stuff"" – a notable comment given that firms like Goldman Sachs are reportedly eyeing new trading services around cryptocurrencies.  ""We're being asked that question but it's more of a venture capital type of interchange, but we're not hearing clients say 'we want to use this as an asset class',"" he said.  And while cryptocurrencies' speculative nature is an issue for him, Fink argued their most important problem is that they are being utilized to launder money.

At the same time, it's not clear at this time if the investment bank will go ahead with the plan. Blankfein made no mention of that report in his tweet.  His comments stand in contrast with those from fellow Wall Street banking CEO Jamin Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, who has made headlines in recent weeks for his declaration that, in his view, bitcoin is a fraud.

Speaking with The Financial Times, head of technology David Eyton struck an optimistic tone amidst work with fellow energy firms Wien Energie and Eni Trading & Shipping, who together with BP have been testing the tech on an energy trading platform developed by Canadian startup BTL. Following the conclusion of a successful trial earlier this year, the firms involved are said to be looking for more participants as part of a broader commercialization drive.  And while Eyton didn't say whether BP is gearing up to use blockchain on a production scale, he did point to its ability to help clear transactions – a potential boon for one of the biggest companies of its kind.  ""There are uses for blockchain that could give us a competitive advantage,"" he told the publication. ""Blockchain can be much more efficient in terms of speed and verification of transactions.""  Eyton also hinted that BP might wind up applying to tech to other business processes beyond trading, indicating possible uses in the area of inter-company payments settlement in particular.

42379970,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LMyF,1507053641,$100 Ahead? Monero Price Holding Strong Above Key Support Level,"The price of monero is showing signs its recent slide may be over.  At press time, the monero-US dollar (XMR/USD) exchange rate was up slightly, rising from a low of $84.18 to $89.40 on the day's trading. But, a closer look at the charts indicates the bump may be a telling sign the privacy-focused cryptocurrency could soon break its slump.  Week-on-week, monero is down 4.3 percent, while month-on-month, the digital currency is nursing 29.3 percent loss. Launched in 2014, monero is an open-source cryptocurrency that uses innovative cryptography to obscure transactions.  In particular, today's price is a sign bulls could be gaining an upper hand in the battle to defend the all-important 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level.  A key indicator in markets more broadly, it's also the exact spot from which monero was able to rally from its July low to its record highs in late August. The 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level is now $80.91, while at the press time the cryptocurrency is trading at $89.40 levels; down 3.96 percent in the last 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap.  Looking ahead, price action analysis suggests that monero's resilience could translate into bearish-to-bullish trend change.  Daily chart  The chart above shows:  Bears have twice run out of steam around 61.8% Fibonacci support of $80.91 in the last month.  A bullish falling channel breakout on Sep 25 was followed by a bearish triangle breakdown of October 1.  Today's candle has a long lower shadow (long lower body), which signals dip demand near the critical 61.8% Fibonacci support of $80.91.  Weekly chart  View  Monero could revisit $97.34–$100 levels in the short-run as indicated by the long lower body of today's candle.  On a larger scheme of things, it is advisable to go with the flow (i.e. trade the breakout). Two consecutive days-end closes above $97.34 could be followed by a rally to $120 levels.  On the other hand, an end of the day close below $80.91 would open doors for a drop to $62.00 levels.

OCBC Bank, HSBC Singapore and the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) jointly announced the customer identification system along with the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IDMA). The IDMA regulates the city-state's media and information communications industries.  The proof-of-concept phase took place between February and May of this year, according to the firms involved. The aim was to shift away from cumbersome, paper-based approaches – which can take days or longer to complete – to wholly digitized ones. By including a shared ledger, banks can verify a customer by turning to information that is being stored and updated overtime.  In a statement, IDMA expressed support for tests of this nature, particularly through the lens of broader work within Singapore on developing new systems to serve an increasingly digital economy.  CEO Tan Kiat How said of the trial:  ""IMDA supports the ambitious use of technologies to transform businesses and create value to citizens. This willingness to experiment is crucial in achieving our vision of a dynamic Digital Economy for a Smart Nation. Revamping the KYC process using blockchain technology is one such example. We are heartened that financial institutions are developing innovative FinTech solutions to improve productivity and deliver a better experience to their customers.""  As for the results of the trial, the banks said that the outcome was mostly positive. According to OpenGov Asia, the group reported that the system saw significant uptime during operation and was resistant to tampering attempts.  Looking ahead, the banks are said to be leaning toward additional testing. According to Nikkei, a representative for OCBC said that the group would explore how it might approach launching larger-scale trials.

The Ministry of Education and Employment has struck an agreement with blockchain startup Learning Machine Technologies to build a prototype platform that will allow users to securely store and share their academic documents – as well as prove that the credentials belong to them.  The system will be built using the Blockcerts open standard, which was developed by Learning Machine Technologies and the MIT Media Lab in 2016.  Evarist Bartolo, Minister for Education and Employment in Malta, stated in a press release:  ""This is a win/win for Malta, whose skilled workforce is among the primary drivers of its economic success.""  Blockcerts allows users to receive, verify, store and share their academic credentials on a blockchain via a digital wallet, which also issues keys that enable secure access to the material.  The release indicates that this is the first time a national government has tested this specific application of the tech.  Back in April, Malta's prime minister, Joseph Muscat, said that pursuing blockchain was high on the government's agenda, and urged his country to be at the ""frontline"" of its development.  ""We cannot just wait for others to take action and copy them."" Muscat said. ""We must be the ones that others copy.""

The Bureau of the Fiscal Service's Office of Financial Innovation and Transformation (FIT) said yesterday that it has hired an as-yet-unnamed contractor to build a prototype system in order to ""track and manage physical assets (for example, computers, cell phones, and the like)."" Formed in 2012 through the merger of two separate agencies, the bureau is chiefly responsible for borrowing money to fund the government as well as handling interagency payments and accounting.  The bureau will test whether its physical assets can be monitored and reconciled in real-time as they are transferred from person to person throughout the pilot, using blockchain to create a digital record of those exchanges.  Beyond that application, FIT will explore other use cases in order to see how the tech may be used ""to improve the way it manages the government's finances,"" according to the agency.  According to today's announcement, the blockchain test is one of two being launched by FIT. The other will see the bureau develop automated programs for streamlining its financial management processes.  ""There are many exciting innovations coming out of the commercial sector that can be applied to federal financial management. I hope that these two pilot projects identify the opportunities where the innovations will have the most impact on efficiency, accountability and customer service,"" John Hill, assistant commissioner for FIT, said in a statement.  With the pilot, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service becomes the latest agency within the US government to actively assess how it might use blockchain to enhance or streamline its operations.

The retreat to $4,255  over the last day suggests investors who lack the financial resources to carry their positions have been spooked by minor price changes. While this unwinding of speculative bets could have gathered pace, spreading uncertainty amongst a wider swathe of investors, that outcome now appears unlikely.  Moreover, the overall outlook remains constructive, given there are no signs of stress on the technical charts and indications that the number one cryptocurrency has already digested the bearish regulatory news out of China and South Korea.  Price action analysis today suggests that the digital asset is now ready to pop higher, having taken the 50-day moving average hurdle in a convincing manner over the weekend.  At press time, the digital currency is trading at $4,290 – down 2.85 percent in the last 24 hours. Week-on-week, BTC is up 11.54 percent, while month-on-month, it is still nursing a 7 percent loss.  Four-hour chart  The golden crossover/bullish crossover – 50-simple moving average cuts the 200-simple moving average from below – adds credence to the rebound from 100-day moving average (repeat of July pattern) followed by a move above the 50-day moving average.  View  The outlook for the BTC price remains constructive. A break above $4,470 (previous day's high) would open up upside towards $4,700. The 10-day moving average is sloping upwards – thus, any pullback is likely to be met with fresh bids.  As for a possible downside, only two consecutive day-end closes below the 10-day moving average would abort the bullish view on bitcoin.

In the 2017 Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA), Europol states that, although bitcoin is still the preferred currency in cybercrime, the landscape is beginning to evolve, with ""monero, ethereum and zcash … gaining popularity within the digital underground.""  The research document analyzes the differing desirability of these cryptocurrencies for cybercriminals, and concludes that monero is increasingly popular due to the ""additional security and privacy features it offers.""  The document explains:  ""Transactions cannot be attributed to any particular user/ address, all coins used in a transaction are 'hidden' by default, and transaction histories are kept private.""  Europol also mentions the cryptocurrencies' popularity on darknet marketplaces, and decribes the first known case, earlier this year, of a monero-focused ransomware named Kirk.  Discussing ethereum's ether token, the assessment restates Europol's earlier concerns that smart contracts could be used to formalize payments between crime service providers. Further, it documents a case of a decentralized darknet market planned to operate on the ethereum blockchain.  The document goes on to say that zcash ""has yet to feature in any reported law enforcement investigations."" However, due to its privacy features, which involves ""obscuring both the transaction recipient and transaction amount,"" darknet marketplaces are interested in the currency.  Although since disbanded, the largest darknet market AlphaBay added monero and ethereum as payment options in the year prior to its closure, and had plans to implement zcash.  Europol shutdown AlphaBay earlier this year as part of an internationally coordinated darknet crackdown.

42400484,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJji5,1507032008,Appcoin Law Part 2: The SAFT Solution,"Marco Santori is a fintech lawyer based in New York City where he leads the blockchain technology team at Cooley LLP.  In this opinion piece, part of an ongoing series on the state of U.S. law as it applies to initial coin offerings and token sales, he explains the significance (and limitations) of the recently announced SAFT project.      Nearly a year ago, I gave a generalized explanation of how some token sales might violate federal securities laws in the U.S. I also gave some tips on how to build a token and network that would avoid security status.  Unfortunately, many token sellers have continued selling tokens to the public prior to developing the network's actual functionality in what I've taken to calling a ""direct presale."" Many commentators, myself included, have found the ""direct presale"" model to be a blunt and risky strategy. I warned against it at the end of my October 2016 op-ed.  Now the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has fired its shot across the bow of the industry in the DAO Report, and other countries have imposed outright bans.  In this Part 2, I propose an alternative: a comprehensive transaction framework that could significantly reduce the risk of the token seller running afoul of the securities laws. We've been working on developing this structure with a few different participants in the industry, including investors, issuers and developers. A few of our clients are already testing it in the wild.  It's called the SAFT: Simple Agreement for Future Tokens. Obviously, it's a play on the Y Combinator SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity). The SAFT is a contract between developers and investors. The SAFT framework is a transaction flow with this contract at its heart.  We didn't invent the SAFT. It was being used in an unexamined way by token sellers before we started suggesting it. It's high time someone looked under the hood, though, and examined whether it actually, you know, works.  At a high level, the SAFT looks like this:  The developer of a token-based decentralized network enters into a written agreement, called a SAFT, with accredited investors. The SAFT calls for investors to pay money to the developer in exchange for a right to tokens once the network is completed. The investors typically get a discount. The developers don't issue any pre-functional tokens at this stage, but they do file the required forms with the SEC.  The developer uses the money to develop the network. This could take months or years. Still no pre-functional tokens are issued.  Once the network's basic functionality exists, the developer creates the tokens and delivers them to the investors, who can sell tokens to the public on the open market to realize their profit.  The developers themselves can also sell tokens to the public if they so desire.  The SAFT difference  Compare this two-step process to the direct presale, where developers sell a pre-functional token directly to the public for immediate delivery or for delivery at some date in the future.  The developers raise millions of public dollars, and use that money to develop the network protocol to functionality. The public takes on all the risk that the project fails, and does so without the benefit of standard disclosure principles, fiduciary duties, heightened antifraud standards or accreditation requirements.  I remain a supporter of the token sale in general, but the direct presale is troubling for at least a few reasons. To keep with the theme of Part 1 of this series, I'll focus on one reason: a direct presale could be considered the sale of a security to the public without a registration statement or exemption in place. That's illegal in the U.S.  I think the SAFT framework addresses this concern elegantly. The SAFT is a written document (available as an exhibit to this white paper here) that looks like a SAFE, and, like a SAFE, the SAFT is a security. At least we think it has a very good chance of being considered a security – and the parties fully intend for it to be one.  We aren't trying to avoid the securities laws here. We're trying to use them.  Investors purchase the SAFT not because they intend to use the tokens on the network once it is developed, but because they seek to sell the tokens on the open market and realize the profit from their discount. There is no (or almost no) consumptive intent here. The investors expect to profit from the efforts of the developer.  Because the SAFT is a security, the developers treat it like one. That is to say, they follow the securities laws when they sell it: they file the requisite form with the SEC, they accredit their investors (if required) and they might even circulate a private placement memorandum.  The investors send their purchase money (in dollars, ether, bitcoin, etc.) to the developers. In exchange, the developers sign a SAFT and work over the next few months or years to develop the network into something genuinely functional.  Once it is functional, the developers create the tokens and deliver them to the investors. Once any lockup period in the SAFT has expired, the investors can then sell the tokens on the open market. The developers can sell them publicly as well.  SAFT semantics  The most common criticism to this approach goes something like this: ""OK, the SAFT is a security. You've followed the securities laws there. But once the developers sell the tokens to the public, plenty of purchasers will buy them just to speculate by trading on an exchange! Isn't that a security as well?""  Well, probably not. Remember, just buying something to resell it for a profit on a secondary market doesn't make the thing a security – not even if all of the other prongs of the Howey test are satisfied. The question is: Where can the buyer reasonably expect that secondary market value appreciation to come from?  Remember from Part 1, for a token to be a security, the Howey test requires that the purchaser expect his profit to result ""from the efforts of others."" If the purchaser expects profit, but it's predominantly from something other than the efforts of others, the thing he bought is not a security under Howey.  For example, when someone buys gold or sugar rights as an investment product (i.e. just to resell it on an open market), that person expects profits, but that profit isn't from the effort of any particular third party. It's from the great variety of market factors affecting supply and demand for gold or sugar.  The price of a functioning token is similarly determined. The value of a functioning token being put to its intended use will be determined by a great variety of global supply-and-demand forces. For a pre-functional token, though, the buyer should expect one force to predominate the others: the efforts of the developer who has promised to imbue the token with functionality.  Thus, the ""efforts of others"" prong of Howey can be satisfied relatively easily by a pre-functional token.  Once functional, the efforts of the developers will no doubt still figure into the value of the token on secondary markets, but it would be difficult to say that protocol upgrades could be the ""undeniably significant,"" ""essential efforts"" (both Howey requirements) that typically cause the price to move.  The ""essential"" efforts of the developers have usually been expended already in creating the functional network. Purchasers of tokens on that already functional network no longer need to rely on the developers to expend those efforts.  Indeed, in most cases it might be difficult to say that the price move was caused by any ""efforts"" at all. For functional tokens, price moves can be caused by any number of forces affecting supply and demand. To use examples from the SAFT Project white paper: A token acting as a medium of exchange on a decentralized market for graphics processing power (I'm making this one up) could fluctuate with the release of a hit video game franchise or the availability of rare earth elements used in graphics card processing.  A token acting as a simple coupon for a free box of razor blades (making this one up, too) could fluctuate with the price of steel, or even the popularity of beards in a target market. To be sure, the token sellers' managerial efforts in updating the network will factor into the price, but will it predominate all the other forces? For an already-functional token, not often.  Striking a balance  In a SAFT transaction, the relatively heavyweight securities laws apply at the early stages, when the whole project could fail and they're most needed.  Recall that the SAFT is a security, so anti-fraud provisions, accredited investor requirements and the like apply to the transaction. The more manageable consumer protection laws apply once the network is functional and, at minimum, buyers expect the network to function.  So, the SAFT framework calls for securities laws when the buyer takes on enterprise risk, and calls for the consumer protection laws when the buyer takes on product risk. That struck us, the authors of the white paper, as the right state of affairs, and we think the SAFT gets us there.  That said, there are plenty of limitations on the flexibility of the SAFT framework. For example, the SAFT:  Isn't necessary for developers who can sell a functional token directly to the public on day one. The SAFT bridges the treacherous regulatory waters between accepting funds and delivering a functional token. If you've already developed a functional token, the necessity of a SAFT is questionable.  Doesn't achieve much for tokens that are themselves securities (e.g. limited partnership interests like the DAO token). Using a SAFT won't make a securities token any less of a security. The SAFT only works for ""utility tokens.""  Won't aid even utility tokens where purchasers remain reliant on the efforts of the token sellers (or others) for their expectation of profit after the token is circulating. Examples include situations where the seller relies on the issuer's promises to buy back the tokens to increase the price, or where the seller promises to develop the truly valuable functionality at some point after the sale.  Even understanding the limitations, the SAFT isn't quite ready to serve as a market standard. For one thing, the analysis we've done is limited to U.S. law. Another reason is that the commercial terms of the SAFT are bare-bones and basic.  For these and other reasons, we've launched the SAFT Project. It's meant to be a forum for discussion and sharing ideas around the SAFT framework. Our door is open for suggestions and criticisms.  In Part 3 of this series, I intend to discuss some SAFT best practices, including tax management strategies and the kinds of tokens that are most compatible with the SAFT framework.      Have an idea for a commercial provision for the SAFT? A criticism of the regulatory arguments supporting it? Noticed a policy consideration we overlooked? Think this whole SAFT thing is doomed? We'd like to know why! Contribute to the SAFT project.

42400481,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJje9,1507028490,European Central Bank Calls for DLT Post-Trade Interoperability,"Researchers at the European Central Bank (ECB) have published a new research report on the impact of distributed ledger technology (DLT) on the harmonization of post-trade settlement systems.  Released by the Advisory Group on Market Infrastructures for Securities and Collateral late last week, the 134-page report examines the technology's possible effect on a variety of services that touch the securities settlement process. It further discusses the implications in the areas of collateral management, asset servicing and data reporting.  Perhaps most notably, the ECB – echoing sentiments expressed previously by the Bank of England – suggested that in a future market where distributed ledgers operate alongside legacy software, both systems will need to be able to communicate as necessary.  The report states:  ""If DLT and non-DLT solutions are to coexist, interoperability between the two approaches needs to be ensured. There may be a need to provide ad hoc matching fields where a participant holds both a DLT and non-DLT account.""  That preference for interoperability was showcased in April when the Bank of England revealed that, while it wouldn't yet use the tech as the basis for its next Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, it nonetheless plans to make it compatible for future developments.  Beyond the interoperability push, the ECB report suggests that in the event that smart contracts – self-executing pieces of code tied to conditions on a blockchain – are more widely used, financial data standards such as ISO 20022 may need adjusting to account for their particular features  ""The potential use of DLTs might have considerable implications for EU financial market integration. In particular, the market may want to consider ISO 20022 extension into smart contract initiation and coding, as well as DLT-specific concepts,"" the report states.  The study notably comes on the heels of a joint release from the ECB and the Bank of Japan early last month, when the two central banks said that they would (at least for now) pass on using the technology for some of their production services.

42400496,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJjsu,1507026645,CFTC Investigating Ether Crash on Coinbase Exchange,"The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is reportedly making enquiries into the ether flash crash that occurred earlier this year on Coinbase's GDAX trading platform.  The flash crash, which occurred on June 21, saw the price per dollar of the ethereum token plummet from $365.79 to 10 cents, before quickly recovering.  According to sources speaking to Bloomberg, the CFTC is specifically looking into what role margin trading may have had in the sudden crash, as Coinbase had allowed traders to borrow money from the platform to make larger trades.  Coinbase began offering margin trading services in March and suspended them following the flash crash. As stipulated on its website, in order to be legally eligible for margin trading, participants had to conform to one of several conditions – for example, holding over $10 million in assets elsewhere.  Sources told Bloomberg that the CFTC sent San Francisco-based Coinbase a letter questioning its margin trading practices, among other enquiries.  Coinbase told Bloomberg:  ""As a regulated financial institution, Coinbase complies with regulations and fully cooperates with regulators. After the GDAX market event in June 2017, we proactively reached out to a number of regulators, including the CFTC. We also decided to credit all customers who were impacted by this event. We are unaware of a formal investigation.""  While Coinbase is not registered with the CTFC, it holds licenses with a number of regulators across different U.S. states.  General manager of Coinbase's GDAX market Adam White told Bloomberg at the time of the flash crash that it was prompted by a trader selling $12.5 million-worth of ether, causing others to panic sell in what White called ""a rapid, cascading event.""  The crash was over almost as soon as it had started, with ether's price back to around $300 within 10 seconds. However, the fall triggered a margin call, liquidating positions held by leveraged traders. GDAX later moved to issue refunds to those who had lost funds in the event.

42400489,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJjn0,1507024806,Boston Fed VP: Blockchain Will Wake Up Swift and Other Middlemen,"""What's the future of Swift?""  Since the rise of blockchain technology, the fate of the financial messaging platform has been at the center of discussions between startups and incumbents. However, the subject was addressed recently by a perhaps unlikely source: Jim Cunha, senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, who perhaps begrudgingly answered the question asked to him at a recent event.  A high-ranking official at one of the 12 institutions that comprise the U.S. central bank system, Cunha drew laughs at a fintech conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia last week when he jokingly tried to defer the question to another panelist.  But despite the acknowledgment of how contentious that question can be, eventually, he answered, and in doing so, showcased an acceptance of the changing role middlemen of all kinds will have to adopt to stay relevant as industries begin migrating to blockchains and other financial technology.  Cunha told the audience:  ""Any incumbent, that's a middleman – which the Fed is, stock exchanges are, Swift is, The Clearing House is – I wouldn't say that the fintechs are going to put us out of business, necessarily. What they will do is wake us up in some cases to be a little more innovative with our systems in a way that's positive.""  Ongoing work  Coming at the tail end of a speech Cunha gave on ""Bitcoin, Blockchain and other Cryptocurrencies,"" Cunha followed the remarks with new details about the The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's work with blockchain and his personal thoughts on what those efforts might eventually mean.  Specifically, Cunha described work ongoing inside the Fed to educate monetary policymakers, payments experts and regulatory specialists on the ""risk and potential"" of blockchain technology.  Included in that work are at least two previously unrevealed proofs-of-concept being built using Hyperledger Fabric and ethereum. While Cunha didn't reveal many details about the PoCs, he did stress they were experiments only.  ""In my lifetime we won't put the platforms we're building now into production. We're trying to learn,"" he said.  And one of the things Cunha and his team have learned is that cryptocurrencies are very different from the underlying blockchains on which they operate.  While the distinction is certainly not new, Cunha's interpretation of that division shows how much outlook on the technology has evolved. Initially, the Fed seemed to lump blockchain together with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, associating the bad reputation of the latter with the former as well.  Speaking on stage, Cunha argued for regulation that does not ""squash the currency,"" because the ""innovation is too important.""  Even as Cunha elaborated on the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies, he the detailed one particular area of concern. He believes an increase in the number of regulated bitcoin exchanges has ""driven a lot of bitcoin [users] to other currencies – monero and others that are built as harder to trace than bitcoin.""  Bridging the gap  And the only way that innovation will be fully realized, according to the bank official, is by increasing partnerships between financial systems new and old, both in terms of technology and people.  He pointed to efforts that have emerged directly from the banking world, including the Stella project, created in partnership between two central banks, and the Utility Settlement Coin project, run by a number of for-profit banks. He further mentioned projects such as Axoni's work with the DTCC and Digital Asset Holdings' work with the Australian Securities Exchange.  Specifically as it relates to Swift, though, Cunha noted the CLS consortium's work on a project designed to work in harmony with the payments messaging system, and even the work done by Swift itself, using both as examples of how blockchain is pushing financial incumbents to become more cutting edge.  While there are nimble startups, said Cunha – pointing to Ripple (which has perhaps been the most aggressive in its pursuit of Swift's market share) as an example of the kinds of business models that could ultimately prove more disruptive – he concluded that partnerships between the two camps are inevitable.  He concluded:  ""The partnerships will be where the ultimate success is.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Axoni and Ripple.

The bonds have a redemption date of December 22 and, despite the short-lived nature of the test, the NSD concluded that the technology could help keep the process ""simple and transparent.""  ""The ultimate goal [of the] NSD is to build blockchain infrastructure for any innovative financial product to operate on. Once the infrastructure is created, [the] technology holds potential to deliver a large variety of financial products and services operated by smart contracts,"" Eddie Astanin, chairman of the NSD's executive board, said in a statement.

42400494,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJjrv,1507017614,Icing on the Cake: R3 Launches Corda Distributed Ledger Version 1.0,"Sounds of celebration twice interrupted R3 chief architect Richard Gendal Brown as he tried to relay the details behind the launch of the newest version of his company's Corda distributed ledger platform.  A major milestone for the startup, Corda version 1.0 follows two years of work, code contributions from over half the consortium's 100 members and more than $100 million in capital raised.  Given the sheer effort involved, it's no wonder Brown's colleagues in London were left fighting for a piece of what could end up being a historic strawberry-cream cake meant to mark the occasion.  Originally unveiled in 2016 as a cheaper, simpler way for global financial institutions to conduct a wide variety of transactions, Corda has since evolved to reimagine the way a wide range of businesses exchange value.  Core to a number of features included in the new release is the platform's ability to let R3's members, partners and open-source enthusiasts build their applications without having to worry about glitches resulting from changes to the code.  Brown told CoinDesk:  ""It will be much easier from one version to the next, and that gives developers the confidence to invest more heavily now, and the platform will still work for them as they go into production.""  Specifically, R3 now guarantees three core APIs will be compatible with older versions of the software, a feature that extends to tools for building decentralized applications and client interfaces for those apps, according to internal documents.  In addition to enhanced privacy, including full support for confidential identities, the souped-up release also includes a redesigned network map service for easier scaling.  While such ""API stability"" at the core of Corda is expected to give users the confidence to invest and build on the platform, R3's developers will continue to experiment with, and improve the code.  ""It's absolutely a critical milestone toward enabling our large and rapidly growing community of developers to get their solution live,"" said Brown.  Turning point  But while Corda may sound like many other blockchain iterations, the platform was always intended to be a little bit different, allowing users to control what information they shared with which users.  Even before today's release, the Corda methodology had proved appealing to banks, regulators and tech companies whose early work helped refine the code.  Most recently, a major U.K. financial regulator; a group of 11 banks including BNP Paribas, HSBC, ING and Mizuho; and tech giant Hewlett Packard have begun working with Corda.  Along the way, all these various projects have provided feedback to the platform, until earlier this summer, when Brown said the frequency these changes were necessary began to diminish.  It was this sense of stability that served as the signal to the company that it was ready to commit to ""freezing"" the core APIs, Brown explained.  As his colleagues celebrated next door, he concluded:  ""We got to the point where the abstraction, the core design kind of just crystallized into a thing that seems to be working well for a lot of other people.""

Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, blockchain technology firm Templum and affiliate broker-dealer Liquid M Capital are today unveiling the platform, also called Templum – the second launch in as many weeks to focus on bringing a new level of functionality and maturity to the cryptocurrency asset class.  Following close behind the launch of an alternative trading system (ATS) by tØ, the capital markets arm of U.S. retail giant Overstock, the platform also seeks to allow investors to exchange any cryptographic token categorized in the U.S. as a security. Not only will Templum allow users to trade tokens on a secondary market, but it will allow them to issue new tokens through initial coin offerings (ICOs).  In this way, the new ATS – which will be regulated by both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) – aims to offer access to the full lifecycle of cryptocurrency security tokens.  Christopher Pallotta, founder and CEO of Templum, told CoinDesk:  ""We know regulation is coming. So, we are trying to find a solution to work with the current ecosystem right now – so as to not hinder the extraordinary developments that we've seen over the last several months.""  The announcement follows on a wave of interest in the use of cryptocurrencies as a funding vehicle, with data from CoinDesk's ICO Tracker indicating more than $2 billion has been raised through such sales to date.  Not only does Templum aim to tap that market, but it's seeking an appeal in secondary markets for the trading of tokens. According to CoinMarketCap, the combined market capitalization for all tokens is approximately $8.7 billion at press time.  'Robust framework'  And, while most of those tokens don't advertise as securities, Templum would be limited to those that are.  Yet, far from a deterrent, many industry analysts believe the more the sector matures (with regulators defining rules and requirements, and platforms launching to accept those regulated forms), more ICOs will want to be classed as securities.  Vincent Molinari, CEO of Liquid M Capital, recognizes that, saying bringing cryptocurrency tokens under existing securities law will provide a host of benefits to both issuers and investors alike.  In his view, securities law provides a ""robust framework"" for token issuance, one that will eliminate the need for issuers to reinvent the wheel from a regulatory perspective each time they issue a new security token. Specifically, he pointed to the importance of anti-money laundering and know-your-customer requirements for keeping bad actors out of the system, and investment suitability requirements that look to mitigate fraud.  Several regulators seem interested in removing those hurdles as well, including those in Quebec, who recently accepted a company looking to launch a security token into its regulatory sandbox and even bending some of the rules for that sale.  These efforts, though, stand in stark contrast to other countries, such as China, which issued an all-out ICO ban early in September.  Molinari continued, adding that a regulated trading solution for ICOs – in both primary and secondary markets – will provide a clear, legally sanctioned way for firms to raise money, which in turn, facilitates capital formation.  Molinari concluded:  ""You can lose money in any investment. Especially when you get into the speculative end of the continuum – but you're reducing your risk of fraud and bad actors by going through regulated entities.""
