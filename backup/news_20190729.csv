42382432,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rdtj,1564439444,US Defense Department to Develop Blockchain Cybersecurity Shield,"The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is looking to forge a blockchain cybersecurity shield.  In a report published on July 12 titled Digital Modernization Strategy, the DoD outlined several ways to advance the nation’s digital defenses. This includes the integration of cloud and quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and improved communications through distributed ledgers.  In fact, DARPA, the research wing of the Department is already experimenting with the technology “to create a more efficient, robust, and secure platform,” to secure messaging and process transactions, reports Decrypt.  Specifically, blockchain may be deployed between units and headquarters as well as intelligence officers and the Pentagon. As part of the Digital Identity Management program, the agency may also issue a digital token that authenticates an agent’s identity.  The DoD is also experimenting with the technology to facilitate the creation of an unhackable code to secure its databases.  As part of the second Cryptographic Modernization program, in effect since 2000, the Department is replacing old hardware and cryptographic systems to meet the challenges of the improved computing power of the nation's adversaries.  Citing the trustless, transparent, and immutable attributes of blockchain the Department writes:  “Blockchain networks not only reduce the probability of compromise, but also impose significantly greater costs on an adversary to achieve it.”  The shift from “low value to high-value work” is also part of the DoDs’ Big Data Platform (BDP), which will handle petabytes of data involved in a number of cross-agency projects. The platform “provides the ability to perform aggregation, correlation, historical trending,” and may perform pattern recognition to “predict attacks.”  Pentagon photo via Wikimedia",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/29/us-defense-department-to-develop-blockchain-cybersecurity-shield,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d79fb9cb332e0caadf124fd1278ef2b1e7b3b33-1700x701.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The exchange, which is also Europe’s largest, is partnering with crypto brokerage, BCB Group, to allow users to deposit and withdraw funds in GBP. The feature will be enabled by the end of the year, according to a statement.  As a FCA-regulated payments institution, BCB was able to set up segregated client accounts for Bitstamp. This move follows Coinbase, Kraken, and the UK firm Coinfloor to offer GBP processing.  A BCB Group representative said:  ""In my speculative view, Bitstamp has concentrated on the EUR and USD markets due to their greater depth of liquidity versus GBP. But now that more crypto liquidity venues are trading in GBP, and now that there is more institutional appetite from GBP clients, it makes sense to have a robust channel for deposits and withdrawals in this currency.""  “We value this partnership... because it enables UK clients to transact with Bitstamp onshore, rather than having to send funds offshore,” said Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, BCB Group CEO, in a statement.  Likewise, a Bitstamp representative told CoinDesk, ""previously... UK customers had to make a deposit to our bank in EUR or USD rather than their native fiat currency.""  Though the announcement does not mean the company will be adding GBP trading pairs, Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodrič sees this development as a way to expand its payment rails to its global customer base.

42382426,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rdjf,1564426801,Circle CEO Allaire to Congress: Treat Crypto as a New Asset Class,"Crypto will take center stage on Capitol Hill for the second time in as many weeks when the U.S. Senate Banking Committee convenes Tuesday to discuss current and potential regulations.  Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, will testify as a representative of the Blockchain Association trade group. He will be joined by University of California at Irvine School of Law professor Mehrsa Baradaran and Congressional Research Service specialist Rebecca Nelson.  The hearing is set to examine the regulatory questions around the industry and should be fairly broad, unlike the hearings on Facebook's Libra project earlier this month.  ""It’s going to be a discussion about the broader industry and what are the regulatory challenges and what can the U.S. be doing better, so I’m pretty optimistic,"" said Kristin Smith, head of the Blockchain Association.  In his prepared remarks, Allaire calls for Congress to treat digital assets as its own asset class, as current regulatory burdens may make it difficult for U.S. companies to conduct business.  ""Being a law-abiding U.S. citizen should not put U.S. companies, or U.S. industry, at a disadvantage in the development of this global technology,"" he said in testimony published Monday, adding:  ""Congress should adopt national policies that define and establish digital assets as a new asset class and develop appropriate rules and exemptions for digital assets. This will require legislation that likely changes our existing commodities, securities, and banking laws, among others.""  Allaire is representing the Blockchain Association because Circle knows these issues firsthand, Smith said. The company has secured a number of regulatory licenses and has restricted U.S. investors from trading certain assets but nevertheless had to lay off staff and move part of its business offshore due to the current regulatory structure.  Blockchain technology will help regulators better track attempts at money laundering, Allaire explains in his testimony.  Crypto vs. Libra  During the Libra hearings, lawmakers drew a distinction between cryptocurrencies in general and Facebook's project specifically.  In his testimony for Tuesday, Allaire likewise contrasts Libra with USDC, the stablecoin jointly issued by his company and Coinbase through the Centre Consortium.  ""Unlike Libra, which is attempting to establish a new global currency and unit of account, the CENTRE protocols provide a path for major reserve currencies to work as digital currencies,"" he said.  CENTRE is also moving away from being based on any single blockchain (right now USDC is built on top of ethereum), he said.  In her prepared testimony, Nelson also contrasted Libra with cryptocurrencies in general, focusing on privacy as one example.  ""The libra also upends the debate about privacy and cryptocurrency,"" she said, explaining that while previous concerns around crypto users centered around whether they ""had too much privacy,"" the issue with Libra is the opposite.  ""Previously, concerns about privacy in cryptocurrency markets focused on whether users had too much privacy: that by partially shielding user identities, cryptocurrencies allowed bad actors to engage in nefarious and illegal activities,"" she said, adding:  ""In [contrast], concerns focus on how users’ data on financial transactions would be protected, and not merged with user data from other Facebook platforms. Although the head of Calibra has pledged that ensuring privacy is a top priority, many analysts are more skeptical given previous scandals involving Facebook’s use of user data and the dependence of Facebook’s business model on collecting and monetizing user data.""  It's unclear if Facebook will come up during Tuesday's hearing, but Smith said it's likely there may be questions about consumer privacy and how different systems might tackle that issue.  ""I think it should be a fairly well-rounded discussion,"" Smith said. ""I don’t think we’re going to hear anything new that we haven’t heard before, I just think it’s going to be a more thoughtful and measured conversation than we’ve heard with the Facebook hearing.""  Financial inclusion  While Allaire calls for specific legislative action, his fellow expert witnesses take more of an educational tone. Nelson, in particular, notes that her testimony examines international regulatory structures, ""as requested.""  ""Digital currencies may have the potential to be adopted more widely, as central banks and large [multinational corporations] look to create their own digital currencies,"" she said, adding:  ""Large-scale adoption of digital currencies could have a range of policy implications for the United States, including financial stability, consumer protections, AML/CFT, privacy considerations, and sanctions policy, among others.""  Law professor Baradaran's testimony  focuses more on the financial system as it exists today and its impact on unbanked and underbanked populations. Her remarks suggest she is skeptical that private citizens or companies developing cryptocurrencies to tackle these issues is the best course of action.  ""There are inequalities and problems in the U.S. banking system and they must be fixed, but they must be fixed through democratic means. Cryptocurrencies want to take over where our public institutions have failed,"" Baradaran says.  While Congress should take note of the crypto industry's criticism, Baradaran concludes that it is up to Congress to act to ""foster financial inclusion.""

42382431,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rdpx,1564425001,Square Crypto Lead: 'The Product We're Focusing on Is Bitcoin',"Square Crypto is focused on bitcoin, not the publicly traded company's specific products.  That was the message Monday during a Twitter ask-me-anything (AMA) with the head of Square's crypto team, Steve Lee.  The unit's playful Twitter account fielded questions from its followers as well as crypto-community luminaries. With tweets signed simply ""Steve,"" it was Lee's first set of public remarks on the team's broad objectives since being hired in June.  Probably the single most illuminating moment of the AMA was this exchange:  Many participants seemed to assume that Square Crypto had been built to improve how the payments company serves its existing crypto users. Square's Cash App has been steadily earning more money on sales of bitcoin, bringing in $65.5 million in revenue for the first quarter of 2019 alone.  However, enhancing the Cash App's crypto functionality is not the team's focus, Lee said, as a tweet similar to the one above made even more clear:  That said, Lee's response to a question about supporting bitcoin core made it sound like the team has another vision for the best use of its resources:  More on Square Crypto's design sensibility has been shared on Medium.  Lee appears to be the team's only hire so far. The Square Crypto account largely dodged questions about team size, but it did make clear that it's close to bringing on another developer:  One participant asked the account why the company wasn't creating its own token, like so many companies in the last few years. Square Crypto responded by posting a tweet from the company's founder:    Bitcoin is resilient. Bitcoin is principled. Bitcoin is native to internet ideals. And it’s a great brand.        — jack 🌍🌏🌎 (@jack) February 5, 2019      Jack Dorsey image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/29/square-crypto-lead-the-product-were-focusing-on-is-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9297ba5b11b9c9ad17ecf8b64a8e83ed28bdb630-2560x2051.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Haven allows users to buy and sell goods and services directly with each other, using cryptocurrencies, without relying on middlemen who take a cut of merchants' transactions or gather shoppers' data.  The app is organized into four sections: shopping, social, chat, and a non-custodial multi-wallet. For all features of the peer-to-peer network, user information is stored locally and protected with end-to-end encryption, meaning only the parties involved in the sale or conversation are able to see the details.  Since OB1 launched its 2.0 of OpenBazaar, 250,000 nodes joined the permissionless network. Jenn Cloud, OB1 communications lead, said “there is a core user base of several thousand who frequently use the software and many more are casual users.” A substantial proportion of the “long-lasting nodes” are merchants.  Image via OpenBazaar  Cloud said:  “We've heard many stories from merchants about finding OpenBazaar a refugee from the high fees, restrictive terms and conditions, and poor treatment of merchants on eBay and Amazon.”  The app has many of the same features as OpenBazaar, but does not support P2P cryptocurrency trading. Additionally, dispute moderation is only supported by the desktop client.  The social feature is new and enables users to easily communicate with each other. Importantly, it is “not connected to transactions or any other activities on the network and will never post anything automatically,” said Cloud.  Like OpenBazaar, Haven will support BTC, BCH, ZEC and LTC. The representative said plans for a previously reported native token, OBC, are currently on hold.  Looking forward, however the team plans to add Ethereum support. Also, though “no firm plans have been made by the OB1 team… several in the OpenBazaar community have begun work to see if it's possible to support Monero,” said Cloud.  Haven is available in the Apple App Storehttps://apps.apple.com/app/id1318395690 and Google Play. This week, the company is offering special deals, such as fifty percent off select electronics and Haven store gift cards, posted in the app “at undisclosed times.”  OB1 has raised $9.25 million to date from investors including Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, OMERS Ventures, BlueYard, Bitmain, Digital Currency Group, and venture capitalist William Mougayar.

42382447,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rdnR,1564416010,Tether Stablecoin Launches on Blockstream’s Liquid Sidechain,"A new version of the widely used but controversial stablecoin tether (USDT) is launching on Blockstream's Liquid Network.  Announced Monday, the addition of the token to Liquid's bitcoin sidechain network, launched last October, will offer bitcoin traders and companies new features that are not available via Tether Ltd.'s original platform.  Liquid was designed as an additional layer to the bitcoin blockchain to offer the ability to transact large volumes of transactions at a higher speed. At launch, a number of industry firms, including Tether's sister firm Bitfinex, had already signed up to help manage and transact with the network using its bitcoin-pegged token L-BTC.  With tether entering the network, it will now be possible to make atomic swaps between Liquid BTC and Liquid tethers, a feature that the firms say will offer lower counterparty risk for those carrying out OTC trades. Further, Liquid’s faster block times will allow traders to quickly complete transfers of fiat between exchanges, making more efficient arbitrage trades.  As far as storing assets goes, Blockstream Green, the firm's wallet offering,​ will allow holders to store Liquid USDT when idle and move them to exchanges when trading. The wallet app was revamped in March to offer new features including multi-signature security and privacy over the Tor network.  Previously a bitcoin wallet, Green was updated earlier in July to support Liquid bitcoin and issued assets.  The press release also suggests the Trezor hardware wallet will ""soon"" support the assets.  “It has been a natural decision to deploy Tether on the Liquid Network given the fantastic work that the Blockstream team is achieving,” said Paolo Ardoino, CTO at Tether and Bitfinex. “Issuing stablecoins, and various other digital assets under one blockchain platform makes a lot of sense and greatly improves industry efficiency whilst allowing traders to manage all their assets from a single wallet application.""  Looking further ahead, the firms say that with the potential launch of lightning network support for tether, ""instant, low-cost stablecoin payments"" could be on the way. Lightning can already be used to make Liquid-based payment channels.  With the launch, Liquid USDT will be supported for deposits and withdrawals at Bitfinex​, while Liquid member firms are working to add the token, according to a press release.  Samson Mow, CSO at Blockstream, said:  “The addition of Tether is a major milestone in increasing the utility of the Liquid Network. In combination with the latest developments in the Liquid ecosystem, traders can now achieve some really cool things, such as OTC atomic swaps, super-fast arbitrage between exchanges, and easy Tether custody with Blockstream Green.""  While Tether aims to peg the USDT token's value to the U.S. dollar, the firm's lawyer recently acknowledged that, in fact, the stablecoin was only about 74 percent backed by fiat equivalents as of April 30. Tether and Bitfinex are currently embroiled in a legal dispute with New York's attorney general.

42382430,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rdsT,1564414946,Judge Punts on Decision in New York Case Against Bitfinex and Tether,"A New York judge has punted on deciding whether crypto exchange Bitfinex and stablecoin issuer Tether need to turn over documents and otherwise comply with a state investigation.  The New York Attorney General's office (NYAG) is looking into allegations that Bitfinex covered up the loss of nearly $1 billion in client funds by borrowing from Tether's reserves. While the case has been ongoing since April, Monday's hearing primarily revolved around whether the NYAG had the authority to conduct its investigation.  On Monday, New York Supreme Court Judge Joel M. Cohen said he needed more time to make a final decision on whether to dismiss the NYAG's case entirely, or rule the other way and reject Bitfinex and Tether's motion to dismiss. As such, a preliminary injunction he filed in May will be extended until the final ruling is made available.  ""I will extend the injunction … if I dismiss the case then obviously the injunction goes with it. If I don't dismiss the case the injunction will be extended,"" Cohen said, adding:  ""The idea is to keep things where they are until the decision of this motion, so the decision is to extend the stay and … extend the injunction.""  If the judge rules in favor of the NYAG's office, the injunction will likely be extended a further 90 days.  The ruling (or lack thereof) means Bitfinex and Tether can continue operating their businesses as normal, but Tether still cannot lend any more funds to Bitfinex.  The case to date  Stepping back, the NYAG's office claims that Bitfinex covered up the loss of $850 million held by a payment processor by borrowing from Tether's reserves, and is trying to obtain documents pertaining to the loan.  The crypto exchange and stablecoin issuer, which share key executives and ownership, maintain that Tether's decision to extend a $900 million line of credit to Bitfinex was negotiated by independent teams of lawyers, and is not reflective of a cover-up.  On Monday, attorneys for Bitfinex and Tether argued that the NYAG's office did not have either personal jurisdiction (power over the companies themselves) or subject-matter jurisdiction (power over the issues at hand).  The NYAG's office, in turn, argued that there is sufficient jurisdiction to investigate whether any harm was done to New York residents.  ""The 354 [action] is meant to assist and expedite our investigation,"" said John Castiglione, senior enforcement counsel with the NYAG's office on Monday.  'As deliberate as it gets'  The NYAG's office filed in April to uncover more information about the loss, the alleged cover-up and the line of credit that Tether opened. Cohen initially asked the parties to negotiate a narrower injunction, before ruling that Bitfinex and Tether can resume normal operations, though prohibiting any more fund transfers from Tether to Bitfinex.  The respondents filed to dismiss the NYAG's suit, claiming the attorney general's office has no jurisdiction over the companies. The NYAG's office filed documents purporting to show that New York-based entities, including Michael Novogratz's Galaxy Digital, have used Bitfinex's services as recently as ""early 2019,"" and a report from The Block claims a New York resident was able to recently open an account, a claim Bitfinex confirmed in a statement.  ""Respondents signed up [to do business] with a virtual currency company in early 2019. That’s as [deliberate] as it gets,"" Castiglione said in court.  Bitfinex's attorneys contend that the New York entities are foreign eligible contract participants (ECPs), entities which may have New York addresses but are not actually based in the Empire State. As such, New York regulators lack jurisdiction, they argue.  UPDATE (July 29, 2019, 23:40 UTC): This article has been updated for clarity.

42382429,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rdrD,1564406434,Dark Web Drug Dealer to Hand Over Bitcoin Millions After Plea Deal,"A dark web drug dealer must forfeit $4 million in funds including bitcoin after pleading guilty to charges of money laundering and conspiracy to distribute controlled substances.  According to a press release from the Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York on July 25, Richard Castro – who went by the pseudonyms “Chemsusa,” “Chems_usa,” “Chemical_usa” and “Jagger109” while conducting his illicit trade – is alleged to have sold carfentanil, fentanyl, and a fentanyl analogue called phenyl fentanyl on dark web markets including AlphaBay and Dream Market from November 2015 to March 2019.  Castro is said to have accepted bitcoin as payment for the drugs and laundered the proceeds in different ways, including using bitcoin wallets and, curiously, by buying around ""100 quadrillion Zimbabwe bank notes."" An alleged co-conspirator in the case, Luis Fernandez, shipped narcotics from locations including from New York City, the release says.  Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said:  “As he admitted today, for years, Richard Castro used the dark web to distribute prolific quantities of powerful opioids, including fentanyl and carfentanil. Castro thought he could hide behind the anonymity of the internet, and use online pseudonyms to deal drugs – like ‘Chems_usa’ and ‘Chemical_usa.’ Thanks to our law enforcement partners, ‘Chems_usa’ is now in U.S. prison.”  In June 2018, according to the indictment details, Castro told customers he was moving his business off the dark web and would carry out his opioids trade via encrypted email. That proved to be his undoing.  Using the “Chems_usa” pseudonym, he asked customers to pay a fee for the email address. However, Castro was caught and arrested after an undercover law enforcement officer paid the fee, was provided the encrypted email address and subsequently placed orders for drugs with Castro.  On Dream Market, Castro is said to have boasted of completing over 3,200 transactions on the dark web.  According to the release, Fentanyl is ""significantly stronger"" than heroin, while carfentanil is around 100 times stronger than fentanyl. It is even considered a chemical weapon.  As part of the plea deal, Castro has agreed to hand over $4,156,198.18 in illicit earnings, including the contents of his seven different bitcoin wallets.

42382422,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rdft,1564401656,Crypto-Focused Finance App Aximetria Wins License From Swiss Regulator,"Aximetria, a firm offering a personal finance app for both fiat and cryptocurrencies, has been awarded a license from the Swiss Financial Services Standards Association (VQF).  The firm told CoinDesk exclusively on Monday that the license – which is recognized by Switzerland’s Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) – enables it to definitively state that its product is ""fully compliant"" with Switzerland's anti-money laundering laws.  The news also means Aximetria can now start operations as a crypto financial intermediary under the Swiss Anti-Money Laundering Act.  The VQF is a self-regulatory organization, primarily responsible for the supervision of anti-money-laundering (AML) and prevention of terrorism funding compliance for Swiss financial intermediaries.  Alexey Ermakov, founder and CEO of Aximetria, said:  ""Compared to the EMI (Electronic Money Institution license), which is the most popular regulation standard for European and British companies, the Swiss license is much more desirable for a fintech company. This is because it also extends to crypto laws in Switzerland and gives us a wide range of future business development, including loans, FX, e-money accounts and salary projects.""  Something like a crypto-friendly TransferWise, the app offers exchange and international payments using the U.S. dollar, the euro and cryptocurrencies, as well as a crypto-enabled debit card in some jurisdictions – the firms says customers must pass a ""rigorous"" remote know-your-customer (KYC) process before they can buy or sell currencies.  The financial intermediary license means that Aximetria will also have to comply with a greater number of rules and guidelines, including audits, AML compliance, on-boarding, KYC and KYB (know-your-business) processes for users, which will be strictly monitored by the regulator on an ongoing basis. However, it also raises the prospects for gaining a fintech license in the future, it said.  “We started with the sandbox model, then we went through all the options for applying the requirements, which were triggers for obtaining a banking license. Finally, we found the business model that most accurately met the project’s requisites: compliance with the AML requirements, the possibility of remote onboarding from anywhere in the world, and other benefits,” said Ermakov.  Aximetria said it aims to provide ""Swiss-level"" financial services to consumers in Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America, including those who are underserved by traditional banks. It recently launched its app in Portuguese and Spanish in a bid to grow its user base in Brazil and Latin America.

42382440,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9re3n,1564394409,Bitcoin Faces Sub-$9K Price Move as Bear Trend Strengthens,"View  Bitcoin dipped to $9,111 over the weekend, forming a bearish candle, despite a quick bounce back above $9,600.  For the sixth day in a row, prices continue to trend below the 50-period moving average – an indication the bears firmly control the short-term trend.  The daily and weekly RSI and the ""awesome"" oscillator are beginning to flash bearish warning signs.  Bitcoin would see a reversal of the short-term bearish outlook only if prices close above $9,880 (July 25-27 resistance) on Bitstamp.      Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to a low of $9,111 at around midnight, then quickly rebounded as the bulls pounced on the opportunity for lower prices and bought the cryptocurrency back up to a high of $9,725 (on Bitstamp) so far on Monday.  However, the general momentum is still favoring the bears, with chart indicators calling a move toward $9,100 and possibly as low as $8,800.  Further, the 50-period moving average (MA) on the daily chart suggests that the bears are beginning to stretch the case for seizing control of the mid-term trend too.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $9,475, according to CoinDesk's bitcoin price index.  Daily chart  BTC can be considered bearish in the immediate short-term as long as prices are trending below the 50-period MA.  The cryptocurrency is now into its sixth day of consolidation below that key line and, the longer prices continue to trend at these levels, the greater the risk for the bulls.  Further, the daily RSI is demonstrating a bearish bias with strong resistance seen at the neutral 50 line (arrows on chart) hinting at a greater pressure from sellers.  Last but not least, the awesome oscillator (AO) is flashing a bearish twin peak pattern, signaling further downside potential with a likely landing pad located along the confluence of support at $8,800 (calculated from the 100-period MA and July 25–27 resistance zone.)  Weekly chart  The weekly chart will do little to lift bullish spirits, with suggestions of a greater pullback than those seen on June 27 and July 10-16.  The prior weekly candle close, for example, produced a bearish engulfing candle, meaning the likelihood for further price discovery at lower levels has increased significantly.  The AO is also demonstrating signs of deflating bullish bias as the bars sink toward neutral amid greater selling pressure.  The onus is now firmly on the bulls to regain control of the short-term trend in order to avoid handing over the reigns of the mid-term trend as well.  For that, they will need to push prices to a close above $9,880 (taken from July 25–27 resistance, as per Bitstamp prices).

42382420,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rb67,1564390806,200-Year-Old Passport Printing Firm Launches Hardware Crypto Wallet,"An Austrian printing company that has history going back to the early 1800s has launched a cryptocurrency storage device.  The new hardware wallet comes from YOUNIQX Identity, a subsidiary of the Vienna-based Austrian State Printing House (Oesterreichische Staatsdruckerei or OeSD) – a secure printing firm which is now the country's high-tech passport maker and provider of other secure identity solutions.  Called Chainlock, the device is aimed to address the vulnerability of of ""hot"" or online wallets to hacking, which OeSD said in an announcement Monday ""are a great security risk.""  The ""100-percent offline"" wallet offers private key generation in a (patent applied for) high-security enclave that OeSD said means the keys cannot be viewed by any outside party – even YOUNIQX or OeSD employees.  While the wallet can be managed via an app, it is secure from unauthorised access to private keys over the internet, WiFi and NFC, the firm claims. Further, crypto-stealing malware like CryptoLocker cannot access keys on the device.  Chainlock takes the form of a credit-card sized sliver of plastic that the firm said is resistant to water and heat.  Should blockchain-based tokens on the wallet be forked, owners of the card will benefit from the creation of new coins, it added.  While OeSD was traditionally a high tech paper printer, it has more recently moved into more high-tech identity and security offerings, some of which YOUNIQX was set up to develop. The innovation arm has already launched MICK (My Identity Check), a secure video identification service, and MIA (My Identity App), an integrated identity management platform.  Available via Coinfinity, some of the Chainlock wallet's anti-fraud features are akin to those found on newer forms of passports or fiat currency, with micro-printing on both sides, hologram, a continuous colour gradient, tactile texturing and UV and infrared-visible patterns.  Priced at €59.99 (around $67) including VAT, the Chainlock wallet is currently available in bitcoin or ethereum options.

42382418,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rbCP,1564387245,"Meet Vitalik Buterin's Mom. Her Mission Is Inclusion, Not Ethereum","Sometimes, spreading the crypto gospel becomes a family business.  Natalia Ameline, mother of ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and co-founder of the educational nonprofit CryptoChicks, is trying to establish blockchain literacy programs around the world.  She told CoinDesk that CryptoChicks has run programs so far from Pakistan to Toronto with 608 students and young developers. CryptoChicks works with Blockgeeks, an educational startup spearheaded in part by Ameline’s ex-husband, Dmitry Buterin, on blockchain-agnostic curricula that cover everything from bitcoin to smart contracts to basic business principles.  And yet, CryptoChicks isn’t turning to Ameline’s son’s business connections, such as Fenbushi Capital, to fund the first CryptoChicks hackathon in the Bahamas this August. In fact, sponsorship for past conferences came from companies like Microsoft, IBM and the Royal Bank of Canada, not crypto companies like the Ethereum Foundation. These programs range from coding workshops designed for women to youth hackathons.  “We’re an educational organization, not a political organization,” Ameline said. “We want to provide women and youth with the maximum opportunity to make their own choices.”  CryptoChicks co-founder Elena Sinelnikova told CoinDesk the group’s programs are open to all genders, even as they prioritize recruiting female participants, which they see as crucial to the mission of onboarding more women into the space without imposing gendered silos.  “One of our goals is to bring more women into the space, but we’re starting by focusing on youth,” Sinelnikova said. “That’s where girls disengage a bit and turn into different areas. That’s why we’re trying to get them involved early on.”  Sinelnikova said CryptoChicks has funneled $350,000 worth of donations into nearly a dozen conferences and programs since the nonprofit was founded in 2017. However, while the nonprofit’s initiatives aren’t exclusively focused on ethereum, they generally do prioritize smart contracts for business use-cases, aka automatic functions built into a blockchain system.  The CryptoChicks hackathon in Pakistan earlier this year helped companies like IBM Pakistan and the local startup CoinBundle recruit crypto-curious talent, according to CryptoChicks ambassador Faiza Yousuf.  Yousuf, founder of the nonprofit WomenInTechPK, said the educational program in Karachi introduced nearly 30 young adults, including 13 women developers, to Hyperledger and ethereum smart contracts. She added there wasn’t much content about bitcoin itself because companies haven’t offered sponsorship and resources related to bitcoin. The focus so far has been on entrepreneurship.  “We want to work with these [hackathon] teams so that they can develop these projects further,” Yousuf said. “There are not a lot of communities here in Pakistan related to blockchain … so this was the first of its kind and we invited a lot of people from the technology industry just to start a conversation.”  Now CryptoChicks is looking to raise $2 million to turn those events into long-standing programs, starting with funding for a mentorship program for the Pakastani participants and the August hackathon in the Bahamas.  Bahamas hackathon  “There are a lot of talented young kids here in the Bahamas,” Bahamas-based conference co-organizer Felix Stubbs told CoinDesk. “This will position them nicely to explore careers in the space.”  So far, Sinelnikova said, 106 students between the ages of 7 and 25 have registered to attend the Bahamas CryptoChicks hackathon.  They’ll hail from public schools, vocational training schools, an orphanage and private schools across the collection of islands, organizers say. There will be five $1,500 prizes given to the winning teams, ranging from gaming apps for the younger participants to smart contracts related to resource conservation for the older students.  Bahamas ambassador Rhonda Eldridge, founder of the nonprofit Harness All Possibilities, told CoinDesk any funding raised for the local program would go toward ongoing classes, mentorship and accommodations for students such as transport for kids from disadvantaged areas.  They’ve already brokered an agreement with one local startup to use its office after-hours as a youth hub. Beyond securing volunteer time and space, the next goal is attracting corporate sponsors.  “Call it a mini business school,” Eldridge said. “If we get the kids engaged [in crypto] we address adoption, access, inclusion.”  Natalia Ameline speaks at Ethereal NY 2019 (image via YouTube/ConsenSys)",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/07/29/meet-vitalik-buterins-mom-her-mission-is-inclusion-not-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a0e30158f6001dd25f09c715033f196b81aa9be6-1500x844.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382412,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rb3b,1564373728,"Perverse Outcomes: FATF, Bitcoin and Financial Exclusion","Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      In last week’s column -- my third on Libra -- I referred to a core dilemma confronting the cryptocurrency project’s financial inclusion goals: the impossibility of being both pro-privacy and pro-KYC.  I promise a break this week from Libra and its controversial founder, Facebook. But I want to dive deeper into that dilemma because the problem is hardly unique to that project. As “know-your-customer” rules have steadily encroached into their world, all cryptocurrency startups trying to expand financial access for the poor are hamstrung by requirements to identify and track the people they seek to serve.  This contradiction stems from tough policies contained under Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism rules (AML-CFT), which were tightened worldwide after the September 11 attacks in 2001 and then again after the financial crisis. Since virtually every bank needs access to dollars, KYC rules everywhere tend to follow models laid down in the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and in guidelines of the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN. Further internationalizing pressure comes from the inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, which sets the regulatory standards by which countries pressure each other to comply.  This network of rules, which empower enforcement agencies to impose stiff fines, hold the Sword of Damocles over bankers’ heads, driving them into risk-averse positions. Bank compliance officers need only mention HSBC (fined $1.9 billion for enabling Mexican drug money laundering) or Standard Chartered (hit with a $1.1 billion fine for similar lapses with Iran) to convince their bosses of a rigorous approach to identifying and profiling customers.  Yet it’s not clear these measures are effective. The UnitedNations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates that a 2-5% of global GDPhttps://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/globalization.html, or between $800 billion and $2 trillion, is still being laundered each year. Would the figures be higher without these tough rules? Maybe. But we have no counterfactual against which to measure performance.  Criminals still have a host of mechanisms to move money around and avoid sanctions. Yes, some use bitcoin – which is why the FATF this year introduced tougher rules for what it calls “virtual asset service providers” – but cryptocurrency’s role is far smaller than that played by fiat currency banknotes. And as revealed in the Panama Papers in 2015, all sorts of shady entities continue to help crooked politicians and their financiers hide identities and obscure money movements.  What we do know is that these rules hinder financial inclusion.  Caribbean governments, for example, complain that their economies have increasingly suffered “de-risking,” as tougher compliance has stanched investment flows to the islands.  The consequences are even more severe for poorer countries, where state-led IDs are either non-existent or easily forged. The heavy scrutiny that foreign banks apply to their counterparties in FATF-labeled “high-risk jurisdictions” means the bar for businesses and individuals in those countries to obtain local banking services is very high. It’s a key reason why 2 billion people worldwide are considered “unbanked.”  This, of course, has a negative impact on poverty, which in turn feeds crime and terrorism – the very problems AML-CFT is intended to fight.  Consider Somalia, a failed state whose institutions are often blacklisted by the world’s biggest banks. It’s difficult and costly for Somalian expats to send money home to family members who rely on such remittances. This perpetuates poverty, drives people into informal payment systems and fosters the disenfranchising economic conditions in which terrorist organizations such as the Somali-based Al Shabaab thrive.  Talk about a perverse effect.  Is cryptocurrency the answer?  The Cypherpunk answer is to say, screw governments. People should use bitcoin, since it enables peer-to-peer digital payments without the intermediation of a regulated entity.  The problem lies at the crypto on- and off-ramps, where government surveillance has become ever more intense. The FATF’s new “travel rule” says cryptocurrency exchanges should be required to obtain information, not only about their customers but also on their customers’ customers, forcing cross-exchange information-sharing. This suggests the only environment where cryptocurrency transactions will be free from KYC exists solely between self-custody wallets. The minute a transaction touches the custodial structure that underpins most exchanges, cryptocurrency will be subject to KYC reporting.  Decentralized exchanges, or DEXes, which provide price and matching services but take no custody of clients’ coins, might be a way around this problem. Recent FinCEN guidance excluded them from the definition of regulated money service businesses in the U.S.  However, cryptocurrency advocacy group Coin Center has raised concerns that the FATF’s definition of regulated “virtual asset service providers” includes a vague reference to entities which “transfer” funds. Vagueness creates uncertainty, which as we’ve seen with bank compliance officers, is toxic to risk appetites. Many lawyers will advise their DEX clients to impose KYC to be on the safe side.  Also, with Helsinki-based LocalBitcoins announcing new KYC rules this year due to a new Finnish anti-money laundering law, it has become much harder for people to find each other in person and agree on a price for exchanging cryptocurrency for fiat without being officially surveilled.  In any case, it’s simply impractical for people in the developing world to use bitcoin as their main unit of account and medium of exchange. Perhaps Libra, with its basket-based stability mechanism, could evolve into a day-to-day payment vehicle, but as we saw from David Marcus’s testimony to Congress, that corporate-backed project will require KYC.  Bottom line: the poor need an easy-access fiat on-ramp.  Monitoring tech advances  We’re back to square one: financial inclusion goals suffer at the expense of governments’ crime-fighting objectives.  One could argue governments should decriminalize money – combat the actual crimes of drug trafficking, arms dealing, and so forth, but treat the right to exchange value as a human right. Let’s be realistic, though: that isn’t going to happen.  So, how to escape this vicious cycle? The answer may lie in blockchain technology’s own capacity to track transfers between pseudonymous accounts – though not as currently applied.  For some time, transaction-trackers such as Elliptic and Chainalysis have helped law enforcement agencies trace cryptocurrency payments to and from bad guys and provided rigorous AML monitoring audit services to companies.  Now, newcomers such as the Coral Protocol and CipherTrace are using high-tech network analyses and cryptographic protections to help businesses share cryptocurrency metadata to flag suspicious behavior without revealing their customers’ personal identifying information, or PII. These could make it easier for companies to comply with the FATF travel rule and generally create a more sophisticated, systemic analysis of risk.  Quite apart from KYC rules, there’s real value here for a cryptocurrency economy increasingly dominated by “bots.""  Still, there’s no way around the law. At the on- and off-ramps, customers must be ID'ed. And, under order from a law enforcement agency armed with these sophisticated tracking tools, a firm must crack open the black box and release the PII to the authorities.  A new mindset  What if, though, governments concede that it’s both impossible and unnecessary to formally identify poor people at the on and off-ramps? What if they accepted an AML model that treats the endpoints as unidentified nodes and, drawing on these new analytic tools, actively managed access to networks based on behavior not identity?  Here, ongoing research in machine learning and high-performance computing by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab in collaboration with Elliptic could be a catalyst. As described by lab researcher Mark Weber, the team uses an approach known as “graph convolutional networks” to create enhanced money flow forensics to address the challenges posed by the “complex layering and obfuscation schemes utilized by sophisticated criminal networks.”  Mapping a massive pool of bitcoin transactions, the researchers have isolated patterns that distinguish between illicit and licit behavior. In a forthcoming paper, they posit their work as a contribution to financial inclusion goals.  One day businesses might use such tools to control access points to cryptocurrency networks without applying traditional KYC, ensuring that good guys get financial services but bad guys don’t, even if neither is furnishing an official ID.  Would regulators go for it? Not, it would seem, under the current mindset. Compliance is used to identify and catch criminals, not as way to control access per se. If anything, the regulatory trend has been toward a greater dependence on state ID and ever more conservative treatment of “high-risk” poor people by financial institutions.  Cryptocurrency compliance expert Juan Llanos complains that regulators “are not open to innovation.” He adds, “As long as government ID is the standard, we are going to have this problem. Anything anonymous is controversial and not allowed. It’s very unfortunate.”  Still, the FATF’s latest round of deliberations did contain one olive branch to innovators: a willingness to explore the potential for “digital identity provided by governments or by the private sector.”  Combine that “private sector” line with a brief reference in Libra’s white paper to “portable digital identity” as a financial inclusion solution, and one can at least imagine financial and tech companies such as those the Libra Association's members hashing out an onboarding solution for the poor that no longer depends on the outdated notion of state IDs.  This approach won’t satisfy hardline privacy advocates, who rightly view exchange as a human right.  But as a pragmatic solution, it’s perhaps the best hope that the world’s 2 billion unbanked have.
