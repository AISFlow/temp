42404302,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhpha,1585345931,Splinter Cryptocurrency Hive Outperforms Justin Sun's Steem After One Week Trading,"It's been a week since the community that drove the Steem blockchain largely broke off to form Hive, and the market action so far has been on the side of the dissidents.      Hive tokens are trading at $0.321 versus steem at $0.168, according to CoinGecko at the time of this writing. The upstart is almost twice as valuable as the original blockchain.      ""This is a true show of how a community can’t be bought,"" Dan Hensley, a major holder of steem, and now hive, told CoinDesk.      To very quickly recap this saga: Steem is a public blockchain largely launched by Steemit, the company, which ran the user interface that made it known as a blockchain for bloggers. Steemit owned enough steem tokens to influence governance, but it never exercised them. Then, following long-term financial stress, the company sold to Justin Sun’s Tron Foundation, which began to make moves to use those tokens to change how Steem worked. A group of developers opted to hard fork the blockchain and create interfaces for it rather than continue to wrestle with Sun, which led to the blockchain now known as Hive.      ""Justin Sun promised to pump our bags and we chose the hard unknown route. And for our price to be above steem from the get-go is a testament to the community,"" Hensley said.      The Tron Foundation did not respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk and has not responded to multiple requests throughout the reporting of this story.      Contentious split    When Hive split, it copied the blockchain so that all the content published on Steem would belong again to Hive users, with the exception of the balances that had been controlled by the now-Sun-controlled Steemit Inc. and its so-called ""ninja-mined stake.""      Meanwhile, a lot of the major pillars of the community are moving over to Hive, and major holders of steem tokens have begun making moves to exit their positions.      ""While it's very entertaining to see Hive trade so much higher than Steem, I wouldn't give it too much weight until there's more time for it to play out,"" crypto trader Brian Krogsgard told CoinDesk via email. ""I presume the Steem 3X from March 18 was related to the snapshot. Whoever got left holding that after it came down could become motivated sellers of Hive if it stays elevated.""      Exits on either side won't happen as suddenly as they could on other blockchains, however, because many Steem believers have had their tokens staked as ""steem power."" It takes 13 weeks to fully unstake tokens that have been staked. They open up in weekly tranches. Airdropped Hive will also be staked.      Hensley said his first tranche is being liberated today and he plans to unload thousands of dollars worth of steem onto the market and will continue to do so until it's gone.      Steem (and now Hive) operate using the delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus model, where a relatively small number of nodes have outside power over what happens on the blockchain. The fork has led to some particularly blockchainy quirks. For example, any tokens that were staked on Steem are now staked on Hive as well.      The upshot of this is that crypto exchange Binance, for example, is not able to move all of its token holdings yet. It decided to support the hard fork by allocating the hive airdrop to its users, despite having initially backed the Tron Foundation in its bid to sway Steem governance.      Steemit running scared?    Steemit is behaving defensively.      The official Steemit channel on the website acknowledged it had started censoring posts that had encouragied Steemit users to exit for for Hive.      The Steemit post sought to defend the company’s actions, stating:      ""Would any commercial website support a post that encourages all users to migrate to another one? No. That would not be in the best interest of the community and the Steem ecosystem.""      Several members of the Steem community have since asked CoinDesk to flag the censorship, with many posts having disappeared from the site. As one longtime Steem user noted on Twitter, Steemit’s terms of service have been updated with the following:    ""Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you agree that you will not: … Use our services to promote third-party platforms or to promote each other without our written permission.""    Hensley noted that some alternatives for content makers are already up and running, including PeakD, Hive Blog and 3speak. Because Hive's genesis ported old content over to the new blockchain, existing Steemit posts should be there on Hive user interfaces.      ""I think with the community exodus many people are ‘powering down’ and selling steem as fast as they can, which puts a lot of sell pressure,"" Roeland Lanparty, a long-time witness on Steem who shut down his node right after the hard fork, told CoinDesk in an email.      Lanparty says users are now using BlockTrades to trade their steem for more hive tokens.      ""I started a full power-down early last week and have already sold my first 1/13th of stake (not financial advice),"" he wrote.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/27/splinter-cryptocurrency-hive-outperforms-justin-suns-steem-after-one-week-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7778cfc075f189d674498c246dc7f1141b6e5986-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The solution, dubbed MiPasa, is launching as a “COVID-19 information highway,” said Jonathan Levi, CEO of Hacera, the company that built the platform.      MiPasa, built on Hyperledger Fabric, is expected to evolve as a range of data analytics tools are added, followed by testing data and other information to assist with the precise detection of COVID-19 infection hotspots.      “We feel that there isn't enough information out there to make informed decisions,” said Levi. “How can we help all the people that would like to get access to data, analyze it and provide insights?”      Enterprise blockchain consortia of the type IBM normally inhabits can take months to assemble, but in this case, Big Blue enlisted a range of heavy hitters in no time at all.      Other players involved in the platform include: Microsoft, Johns Hopkins University, China’s National Health Commission and more. WHO did not respond to a request for comment as of press time.      IBM Blockchain CTO Gari Singh said everyone he had spoken with agreed it was important to “kickstart a consortium” as soon as possible.      “We started off brainstorming ideas on how to collect, provide and use verified information about the virus,” said Singh. “It's not that we were trying to force blockchain into this solution, but we thought we need to replicate data, we need to have trusted sources, we need to make sure it can't be tampered with.”      IBM is also bringing the Call for Code initiative to work on the platform to rapidly create tools that might be able to help stem the crisis. Looking ahead to the coming weeks, Singh said things like coronavirus testing data could be added to the platform.      “You could think of a simple set of applications for the drive-through testing,” he said. “Using an iPad you could enter some information without having to know who the person was. We can start to collect that and build new applications off that.”      Hacera’s Levi said analytics tools can provide powerful insights, provided everyone can be sure and agree all the data on the platform (which is entirely open and free to use) is correct and consistently versioned. He said a host of companies are offering their data smarts to help curb the virus.      “Lots of data tool providers are getting involved.

Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) appeared to be in a period of consolidation where prices bounce around within a tight range, showing indecisiveness among traders.      Bitcoin and ether had both climbed by less than a percent. Notable performers on CoinDesk’s big board include XRP (XRP), up 10 percent, Stellar (XLM) in the green 3 percent and dash, up 4 percent. All 24-hour price changes are from 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET) on March 27.      Traditional markets, meanwhile, continued to reel from the record unemployment claims in the U.S., part of the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, despite a $2 trillion stimulus package making its way to President Donald Trump for his signature. U.S. stocks closed with the S&P 500 index down 3 percent. Earlier in the day, Japan’s Nikkei 255 closed its session up 3.8 percent. For Europe, the FTSE 100 Index closed in the red 3.3 percent.      See also: How a Flurry of ‘Digital Dollar’ Proposals Made It to Congress      Federal Reserve ""and fiscal policies have averted for now accelerated economic and financial de-leveraging. Unfortunately, they can't avoid a deep and sudden recession resulting in alarming unemployment and business closures,” Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, wrote in a tweet.      On low volumes, bitcoin’s price changes have narrowed, staying in a $6,400-$6,900 per 1 BTC range since March 24. This has put the bellwether cryptocurrency’s 10-day and 50-day moving averages close to each other.      “I think bitcoin just moved up from its $4,000-$5,000 crash range earlier than equities did. While equity markets have been rallying the last couple of sessions, other more safe haven-type markets like bonds and gold have been consolidating,” said Siddharth Jha, a former Wall Street analyst now focused on blockchain technology at startup Arbol.      Indeed, gold has started to consolidate moving averages as of March 27.      “Some people I respect say gold is a buy here,” said Rupert Douglas, head of business development for institutional sales at Koine, a digital asset manager. “Perhaps it is, perhaps silver is going to go rocketing higher, but if it doesn't and trades lower, does bitcoin follow?”      The crash on March 12 is still fresh in the minds of crypto traders and fund managers, leaving some to think no trading decisions are the best decisions for the time being.      “Markets need to be saturated for people to look for incremental yield. Plus, there’s a lot of wound licking, post-BitMEX debacle,” said Vishal Shah, founder of Alpha5, a new derivatives exchange backed by large crypto funds.      See also: Strange Days: S&P 500 Is More Volatile Than Bitcoin This Month      Shah was referring to the $700 million of liquidations on BitMEX on March 12.

42404317,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhpvM,1585332006,Strange Days: S&P 500 Volatility Enters Bitcoin Territory,"CORRECTION (March 28, 15:51 UTC): Due to a data calculation error, an earlier version of this story overstated the S&P 500's volatility in the days since March 12. It has risen, but not above 80 percent.      In a role reversal befitting these topsy-turvy times, Wall Street has recently seen more turbulence than the average for the top cryptocurrency.      The S&P 500’s 30-day volatility of daily returns, or historical volatility, jumped to nearly 80 percent Wednesday, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.      Meanwhile, bitcoin’s (BTC) volatility gauge stood at 138 percent on Wednesday compared to the average volatility of 65 percent seen in the March 2019-February 2019 period, as per CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      The 30-day volatility of daily returns calculates the standard deviation of the daily gain or loss from each of the past 30 trading days and is usually expressed in annual terms irrespective of the time period.      See also: Miners Are Selling More Bitcoin Than They Are Mining      Put simply, it gauges fluctuations from the mean but does not measure the direction. So, when we say that the S&P 500’s volatility reading has surpassed bitcoin's average, it means the cryptocurrency on average witnesses smaller deviations from the mean compared to what the equity index has seen over the last 30 days.      The S&P 500’s volatility began rising in the first week of March as the coronavirus outbreak outside China gathered pace, stoking fears of a global recession.      The situation worsened in the second and third week, as the persistent sell-off in stocks triggered margin calls, forcing investors to treat traditional safe-haven assets like gold and U.S. Treasurys as sources of liquidity.      That further boosted uncertainty and added to the price volatility – so much so that 4 to 5 percent daily moves have become a new normal.      In fact, the volatility in the equity market recently rose above the lifetime average of bitcoin’s 30-day volatility, as pointed out by ARK Investment Management’s crypto-asset analyst Yassine Elmandjra. So by this one measure the benchmark equity index has become a relatively risky asset.      Of course, bitcoin, too, has witnessed its fair share of price volatility with institutions exiting the market amid a global dash for cash and price drops getting exaggerated due to forced long liquidations on derivative exchange BitMEX. The situation, however, has been somewhat better lately compared to Wall Street in terms of volatility.      See also: Bitcoin Halving 2020, Explained       The cryptocurrency’s 30-day volatility hovered below its 12-month average of 65 percent in the first 11 days of the month. However, on March 12, prices fell by a staggering 39 percent from $7,950 to $4,777 and printed lows under $4,000 on the following day.      With the sudden price crash, the 30-day volatility jumped to 106 percent on Mach 12 and has remained elevated ever since, despite the price recovery and relative stability in the $6,500 to $7,000 range observed this week.      Looking forward, the volatility in stock markets may subside, as the central banks and governments across the world have launched monetary and fiscal lifelines to contain the economic fallout from the virus outbreak.      The Federal Reserve has cut rates to zero and announced an open-ended asset purchase program. Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate approved a $2 trillion fiscal stimulus plan this week.      A potential decline in the stock market volatility could conceivably also tame volatility in the bitcoin market. That said, the next halving of miners’ rewards is due in May.

42404307,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhplW,1585330230,How a Flurry of 'Digital Dollar' Proposals Made It to Congress,"The “digital dollar” took just eight days to get into the U.S. Congress.      Advocates for digitizing coronavirus relief payments began working with congressional staffers earlier this month to outline how the Federal Reserve could potentially distribute funds to unbanked individuals quickly as the country’s economic downturn worsened.      Morgan Ricks, an associate professor at Vanderbilt Law School, told CoinDesk that a provision detailing the digital dollar in two different bills from the House of Representatives reflected assistance that he, along with Columbia University fellow Lev Menand and University of California Hastings law professor John Crawford, provided. The group has long advocated for a digital dollar, writing a paper in 2018 on the subject and a Bloomberg opinion piece earlier this week.      Ricks told CoinDesk in a phone call Wednesday that he had been working with staffers since around March 17. Ricks refused to specify which House staffers he had worked with.      “A digital wallet with the Fed would be a ... relatively easy way of [distributing funds],” Ricks said.      Still, while the bills painted the initiative as an urgent one targeted at providing immediate relief to U.S. residents, Ricks said the process might take some time.      Read more: US Senate Floats ‘Digital Dollar’ Bill After House Scrubs Term From Coronavirus Relief Plan      “The ultimate vision here is that at some point down the road, probably next year, people really would have a direct account with the Fed consisting of digital money and there wouldn't be any other intermediary bank,” Ricks said. “The Fed doesn't have that retail capability right now.”      State-level advisers may also be assisting, said Sheila Warren, head of blockchain and distributed ledger technology at the World Economic Forum.      That Congress was thinking about digital currencies after last year’s libra hearings is not a surprise, she said.      “The fact that it even got that far means there’s already a lot of behind-the-scenes action happening that’s already working on this,” she said.      The language first appeared, and was then promptly stripped from one of two House bills, on Monday – and is likely to be dropped from the other House bill. Then the digital dollar roared back to life with its own dedicated draft bill before the U.S. Senate. That bill was introduced Monday by Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who is also the ranking member on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.      Vanderbilt’s Ricks said he had not seen the Senate version and was not working with Brown’s office.      “At the height of this pandemic we must do more to protect the financial wellbeing of hardworking Americans and consumers,” Brown said in a statement. “They are on the front lines of this crisis and are already feeling the effects of the economic fallout.”      A source familiar with the effort said Brown’s office intends to pursue the legislation, currently sitting before the Senate Banking Committee.    Banking the unbanked?    In a statement, Brown painted the proposal as one aimed at helping unbanked or underbanked individuals access financial services, a goal many crypto projects – including the Facebook-led Libra stablecoin effort – likewise target.      “My legislation would allow every American to set up a free bank account so they don’t have to rely on expensive check cashers to access their hard-earned money,” Brown said.      These concerns are not unfounded: According to the New York Times, the final relief bill, which both the House and the Senate passed, allows the federal government to send the payments only to eligible American taxpayers with direct-deposit bank addresses on file with the Internal Revenue Service. Eligible recipients who don’t have an address on file or whose address is outdated may have to wait four or more months.      Indeed, the bill itself states that funds will be disbursed “electronically to any account which the payee authorized” for tax refunds on or after Jan. 1, 2018.      Taxpayers will be notified no more than 15 days after the funds are distributed that they received the payment – via mail.      “Such notice shall indicate the method by which such payment was made, the amount of such payment, and a phone number for the appropriate point of contact at the Internal Revenue Service to report any failure to receive such payment,” the bill said.      According to the Times, this means roughly 70 million people will actually receive a payment in the coming weeks. The U.S. population is just under 330 million.      The digital dollar proposals would prevent banks offering wallets from requiring a minimum balance, as well as provide “reasonable protection against losses caused by fraud or security breaches,” Brown’s bill said.    Next steps    Future progress on the concept could take a while. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has recessed the legislative chamber until April 20, meaning no votes are expected before next month, barring any emergencies.      A project of this scale shouldn’t be rushed either, said Warren, who was named Thursday as an adviser to the Digital Dollar Foundation launched by Christopher Giancarlo and Daniel Gorfine, former officials at the Commodities Futures Trading Commission.      Warren told CoinDesk she remains skeptical as to the use case for a digital dollar issued by the Fed, but is especially concerned with a potential rush job.      “You can’t do it that quickly and be smart about it,” she said, describing an emergency-tinged deployment as “a non-starter.” Paper checks may not be ideal, but “the idea we could suddenly pivot is not realistic.”      Read more: Former CFTC Officials Ramp Up Push for Digital Dollar With Accenture Partnership      One of Warren’s concerns is that any short-term, privacy-invading tools may remain a permanent fixture.      “I don’t think it’s ever temporary, I think it becomes permanent very quickly,” she said.      David Treat, a senior managing director at Accenture, told CoinDesk that from a practical viewpoint, there would need to be a massive push to collect the necessary information from individuals to set up a distribution system.

42404312,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhprQ,1585327500,Aspiring CME Director Wants Exchange to Mine Bitcoin and Issue Tokens,"A nominee for a CME director role believes the Chicago-based exchange, one of the few regulated providers for crypto derivatives, should issue its own tokens and mine bitcoin with renewable energy.      In a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Wednesday, Dante Federighi said that if elected, he would turn CME B-shares into ""New_CME_Tokens"" to improve governance by making membership accessible and improve liquidity.      CME B-shares were distributed to CME members – the exchange's main market participants – after demutualization in 2000. Compared to the publicly tradable A-shares, B-shares are only available to CME members and offer special voting-rights to elect six people to the board of directors, the position Federighi seeks.      See also: CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Trading Volume Hits 2020 Low – That’s a Bullish Sign      Federighi, a CME member since 1997, argued the exchange would need to create as many as 9,600 CME tokens, each representing hundredths of a B-share. The blockchain could replace complicated legacy structures, with tokens redistributed to existing B-share holders, he said.      ""Digitize and fractionalize B-shares into hundredths of a membership. Let them trade freely on a blockchain where all transactions and ownership are recorded,"" Federighi said in his proposal. Tokens would ""enable future owners to gradually buy into a membership over time.""      Federighi also proposed that CME should build its own renewable energy plants to power operations and ""divert the excess energy to mine Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,"" which could be ""immediately converted"" into fiat.      Not only would that create a new environmentally friendly revenue stream, but it would also help familiarize the exchange with a new technology and asset-class, he argued.      ""While this seems outside of our core competencies, I’d argue this is our business: we, like the miners, match and clear trades,"" he said.      See also:CME Takes Its Bitcoin Options Live, Competing With ICE’s Bakkt      A footnote says the proposals were not checked by CME management and ""some may not be feasible.""

42404316,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhpuN,1585324856,US County Extends Rule Making Bitcoin Mining Firms Invest in Renewable Energy,"Officials in Missoula County, Montana, are considering turning a temporary measure for bitcoin mining operations – that offsets energy consumption with renewables – into a permanent fixture.      The Missoula County Board of Commissioners voted unanimously Thursday to extend a measure to reduce the environmental effects of high-energy-consumption mining operations by another year, until April 3, 2021. That followed a consultation period in which 47 members of the public commented in support of the motion, according to a report by the Missoulian Friday.      Under its zoning regulations, Missoula County requires all mining operations – drawn to the area because of its cheap electricity – to either purchase or build renewable sources of energy that completely offset the electricity they consume. The measure also restricts mining operations to designated industrial districts.      The yearlong extension will provide officials with time to consider making the measure permanent. ""We are continuing to investigate this issue and this zoning and may ultimately propose it as permanent zoning,"" said Jennie Dixon of Missoula's community and planning services.      See also: A New York Power Plant Is Mining $50K Worth of Bitcoin a Day      The original measure came after local residents voiced concerns about the power spikes caused by newly arrived mining farms, and was passed as part of a resolution last April that committed the county to operate completely on clean renewable energy by 2030. The requirements don't apply to miners operating before the resolution was passed, so long as they don't then scale up their operations.      At the time, one official complained about the ""grotesque amount of energy"" consumed by HyperBlock, a bitcoin mining company that reportedly used as much electricity as a third of all homes in the county. The company complained the measures were aimed at them and risked driving them out of business.      Officials denied the measures were intended to target any one business in particular.      During a public hearing Thursday, supporters of the measure said crypto mining placed greater demands on the energy grid, making the county dependent on fossil fuels and accelerating climate change. The attorney representing HyperBlock denied the company was ""in any way contributing to climate change in our jurisdiction.""      See also: Miners Are Selling More Bitcoin Than They Are Mining      Commissioner Dave Strohmaier said the decision on whether to make the motion permanent or not will depend on whether energy demand in 2020 can be met by renewables.

The asset manager told CoinDesk Friday that it's working to list shares of its Bitwise 10 Index Fund on OTCQX, an alternative trading system regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If approved, retail investors and advisors would be able to trade the fund on popular platforms including Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, said CEO Hunter Horsley.      The company has several steps before it can begin trading. The first is an announcement to current shareholders, Horsley said, which occurred on Friday. Bitwise will also have to publish public disclosures in accordance with ATS reporting standards and have a market maker file a Form 211 with FINRA.      Once FINRA approves the Form 211, trading can commence.      ""We expect approval for trading in the second half of 2020,"" Horsley said. ""It’ll take a number of months for trading to commence.""      He likened the process to Grayscale Investments' Bitcoin Trust product, which already trades on OTCQX. Grayscale currently lists shares of its Digital Large Cap Fund, Ethereum Trust and Ethereum Classic Trust on the platform.      Like the Grayscale large-cap fund, the Bitwise 10 Index Fund is a diversified one. Horsley noted it holds assets representing 85 percent of the crypto market capitalization.      ""[It] has a formal public methodology, has governance – both a committee and an advisory board – and it’s designed with several rules to screen and handle the nuances of the crypto space,"" he said.      The fund includes bitcoin, ethereum, XRP, bitcoin cash, litecoin, EOS, tezos, stellar lumens, ADA and ethereum classic.    Growing interest    Interest in this type of product is growing, Hunter said, adding that Bitwise is holding some 2,000 calls per month with advisors.      According to a survey Bitwise published earlier this year, 72 percent of advisors said their clients were asking about crypto. About 6 percent of respondents already allocate funds to crypto assets, and this figure is set to double by the end of the year, Horsley said.      Nor does he see the current economic downturn due to the COVID-19 outbreak to be a major concern.      Still, he noted that ""during a panic, everything can happen.""      Further on, Horsley said, he hopes to list a potential bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) – a product several companies have attempted to get approval from before – alongside the index fund.      ""We’re continuing work on the bitcoin ETF, so the index fund here would exist alongside a future bitcoin ETF as another option,"" he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | BUSINESS | ETC | MARKET | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/27/bitwise-looks-to-retail-market-for-its-crypto-index-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a26ab0bde41741ada6d09db6d06463789970398d-1100x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On March 18, the miner's parent company, investment firm DPW Holdings, filed an update with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on its business related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been heavily affecting companies and markets globally. Among other closures and down-scalings, its mining business is being shuttered.      “Digital Farms' cryptocurrency mining operations have been suspended indefinitely, primarily due to the sharp decline in the market price for bitcoin,” the company wrote.      Last May, DPW announced Digital Farms, formerly Super Crypto Mining, had obtained a 617,000 square foot facility in the U.S. to set up operations with “immediate access to 28 megawatts of power and an infrastructure to support up to 300 megawatts.”      Super Crypto Mining was acquired by DPW in January 2018 and later re-branded as Digital Farms. According to DWP's annual report filed with the SEC in April 2019, the mining operation had started off by borrowing $5 million from two institutional investors and buying a thousand of Bitmain's Antminer S9 mining machines. Mining of bitcoin, litecoin (LTC) and ether (ETH) under the new owner kicked off in February 2018.      See also: Miners Are Selling More Bitcoin Than They Are Mining      The company’s first yearly revenue from crypto mining was $1.67 million, a small portion of DPW's total $27 million revenue, according to the 2019 report. The company had been planning to mine the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and also offer cloud mining services.      Discussing its scenario under the coronavirus pandemic, DWP said in the latest filing: ""Due to the unprecedented market conditions domestically and internationally, and the effect COVID-19 has had and will continue to have on the Company’s operations and financial performance, the extent of which is not currently known, the Company is temporarily suspending guidance for 2020.""      Bitcoin's price has been dropping since February from levels above $10,000, making it hard for the mining industry to return a profit.

42404289,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdho4F,1585314000,"After Coronavirus 'War,' Bretton Woods-Style Shakeup Could Dethrone the Dollar","For governments, fighting the coronavirus pandemic is like fighting a war.      The leaders of Italy, Spain and Germany have used the analogy – along with the CEOs of Bank of America and the U.S. telecommunications giant AT&T – to describe the mass-scale efforts needed to combat the disease: mobilizations of the health care industry, a retooling by factories to produce masks and makeshift morgues to accommodate a fast-rising death count.      During a televised press conference this week, U.S. President Donald Trump characterized himself as a “wartime president.”      Now, it’s becoming clearer that the economic toll of the virus, as in a war, is likely to be dire. In the U.S. alone, a record 3.3 million jobless claims were filed last week. Deutsche Bank predicts the country’s job losses might exceed 15 million, with Europe approaching a similar level. Countries are prepping aid and stimulus packages into the trillions of dollars, stretching already heavily indebted government balance sheets. Central banks led by the U.S. Federal Reserve have pledged nearly unlimited support to financial markets. Investors have flown to safety in U.S. dollars, and in doing so driven down emerging-market currencies, inflicting additional economic damage on some of the world’s poorest countries.      See also: Why the US’ $2 Trillion Stimulus, Unlimited QE Will Expose the Monetary System’s Flaws      So with officials starting to envision what it might take to rebuild damaged economies and restore society to a semblance of normal, speculation is mounting that seismic shifts might be in the offing for the global monetary system — a phenomenon that historically has occurred in the wake of world wars.      Think Bretton Woods, the historic gathering in 1944 at a mountaintop resort in New Hampshire, which set the template for the current system and entrenched the dollar’s near-century-long reign as the world’s dominant currency.      “I wouldn't rule out anything at this point,” says Markus Brunnermeier, a Princeton University economics professor who has advised the International Monetary Fund, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and European Systemic Risk Board.    Questioning dollar dominance    Even before the coronavirus hit, questions were percolating among some economists and monetary officials over whether the dollar-based system could last through the 2020s.      One concern is that monetary policy in the U.S. – actions by the Fed to maximize domestic employment and keep prices stable – reverberates through countries all over the globe, often saddling them with higher inflation whenever their currencies weaken versus the dollar; while exporters of raw materials or manufactured goods might become more competitive, consumers feel the pinch from higher prices for imported goods. Another factor is that so many commodities such as oil, copper and gold are priced in dollars, leaving producers including Russia, Brazil and South Africa at the mercy of foreign-exchange markets.      See also: Don’t Apply 2008 Thinking to Today’s Crisis      Bank of England President Mark Carney floated the idea of a “synthetic hegemonic currency,” possibly based on new digital-asset technologies, to reduce the dollar’s “domineering influence” on global trade. China, the world’s second-largest economy, has been pressing forward with a digital version of its yuan that might be used more widely in global trade. Facebook, the social network, proposed last year to create its own payment token, libra. Bitcoin, launched in the throes of the 2008-09 financial meltdown, offers another alternative.      “Eventually we're going to get past this crisis,” said Tim Shaler, a former portfolio manager at the bond fund Pimco who now serves as chief economist for iTrust Capital, which allows clients to buy cryptocurrencies and physical gold through their retirement accounts. “If there's a possibility to create some digital currency not tied to any domestic economy, there might be an opportunity for somebody to figure that out.”    The Fed helicopters in with trillions    It’s little surprise the Federal Reserve is intervening so deeply in U.S. markets during a time of crisis. That ""quantitative easing"" (QE) playbook was put in place by former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, who garnered the moniker “Helicopter Ben” thanks to his advocacy for plying the financial system with large quantities of much money when needed. In a matter of months in 2008, from August to December, the Fed’s balance sheet doubled in size to more than $2 trillion. It doubled again during the next few years to over $4 trillion.      On Monday, the U.S. central bank, now led by Chair Jerome Powell, made an unprecedented pledge to buy bonds in unlimited amounts to support markets, while reviving 2008-era QE emergency-lending programs to ply banks, Wall Street dealers and even corporations with fresh liquidity. The new efforts could quickly balloon the Fed’s balance sheet to north of $8 trillion, says Stephen Cecchetti, who headed the monetary and economic department at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, in the early 2010s.    If there's a possibility to create some digital currency not tied to any domestic economy, there might be an opportunity for somebody to figure that out.    On Wednesday, lawmakers in Washington were negotiating a $2 trillion aid package, but the investment-research firm Evercore ISI predicted this week in a report that another $3 trillion might be needed. Some of the Treasury bonds issued to finance surging U.S. government budget deficits might get sopped up by the Fed.      “The central bank has to be a part of the war machine,” said Cecchetti, now a professor of international economics at Brandeis University.    The dollar’s inflationary threat    Despite the flood of new dollars, the U.S. currency has surged in recent weeks to its strongest levels in three years. Inflation is muted, and the economy’s weakness means prices in the U.S. won’t be pressured upward anytime soon.      But the Fed’s trillions could eventually lead to higher inflation. There also might be a renewed outcry that such money injections merely bail out bankers and rich people, with few of the benefits going to the middle or lower classes – similar to the arguments of the Occupy Wall Street movement that followed the 2008 crisis.      Outside the U.S., central banks might emerge from the coronavirus shock with a stronger appetite for independence from American influence over the global monetary system.      See also: Geopolitical Crisis May Benefit Oil, Gold and CBDCs, Not Bitcoin      “It's going to be interesting to see how it plays out when we have at least two major financial players that are going to emerge from this,” said Omer Ozden, CEO of RockTree Capital, a merchant bank with expertise in blockchain technology. “China will have its own thoughts and may take a different direction from, let's say, a Bretton Woods-style global organization.”    Trustless world, trustless systems    It’s highly unlikely the global monetary system would see a negotiated accord along the lines of the Bretton Woods accord, which was joined by 44 countries, said Edwin Truman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who oversaw the Federal Reserve’s division of international finance from the late 1970s through the late 1990s.      Trump’s brash, freewheeling style and protectionist impulses in recent years have alienated former allies in Europe, and his border wall campaign has ratcheted up tensions with Mexico. He demonized China in last year’s trade war and recently referred to the coronavirus as the “China virus.”      See also: Bitcoin and Gold: Evaluating Hard-Cap Currencies in Times of Financial Crisis      “One of the big challenges of today, in contrast to 2008-2009, is that the state of national cooperation is pretty low,” Truman said. “In order to do, collectively, a big change in the system, people would have to agree, and everyone seems to be fending for themselves.”      For George McDonaugh, CEO and co-founder of Isle of Man-based KR1, a publicly traded cryptocurrency investment company, it’s the head-scratcher of “helicopter money” that might ultimately raise fundamental criticisms of the current monetary system. Deep interest rate cuts and central bank money injections in ever-growing quantities appear to have become the default solution whenever a market crisis hits every seven to 11 years.      The Fed’s trillion-dollar money injections during the 2008 financial crisis did little to weaken the dollar’s dominance in the years since, but this time might be different.      “If someone on TV says we can have infinite money, someone on the other side of that TV screen says, 'Why have I been working my ass off for the past 40 years?'” McDonough said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/27/after-coronavirus-war-bretton-woods-style-shakeup-could-dethrone-the-dollar,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/875c08802be703d43379ada8f1fe0d49d4545aca-1500x1060.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404282,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdho1I,1585310400,Don't Apply 2008 Thinking to Today's Crisis,"Jill Carlson, a CoinDesk columnist, is co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system. She is also an investor in early-stage startups with Slow Ventures.      Yesterday, it was reported that 3.28 million Americans filed for unemployment in the past week. This number dwarfed official expectations (about one million) as well as any previous figures ever reported, including during the Great Recession.      There is also good reason to believe this number does not even capture all of those who lost their livelihoods in the last seven days. A combination of confusion, bad information and bureaucracy, coupled with the fact that many of these Americans will be filing for the first time, means the number laid off may be much higher.      See also: Stop Treating Bitcoin as Risky. It’s a Safer Asset Than Most      Yet, in the hours after the announcement, the U.S. equities market rallied 4 percent, extending a three-day “winning streak,” as many of those in the business would call it.      But let’s be clear: There are no winners to be declared in the midst of this crisis.      President Donald Trump has been quick to express hope for a fast economic re-opening. Wall Street has been continually calling out for a “V-shaped” recovery, or a quick rebound off a bottom. A string of hedge fund managers, politicians and pundits appear on television and in our Twitter feeds daily, reassuring us of what is possible.      Financial markets, with little left to grasp onto, have clung to this sentiment. Deep breaths. It will all be okay. This, too, shall pass. Thoughts and prayers.    In 2008, banks were undercapitalized. This was really the root of the systemic failure that occurred. This time, it is hospitals that are overcapacity.    Economists, analysts and big bank CEOs tell us that there is nothing to fear because this time is different from 2008. This time there is no risk of systemic failure.      There are three points I would like to raise in light of this argument:      1. Dismissing risk of systemic failure is premature.      Systemic failure is almost by definition hard to discern ahead of time or even in the moment. It is nearly impossible to accurately forecast the cascade of downstream effects.      Very few have the privilege of a bird’s-eye view perspective in any given crisis. We are more likely to be foot soldiers in the fog of war than generals drawing battle lines. Therefore, it is devilishly difficult to see how a systemic failure will develop and affect other parts of the system as well as other systems altogether.      See also: Cryptocurrency Is Most Useful for Breaking Laws and Social Constructs      Even those who are in a position to see it all often do not. Like the general in his bunker, it is too easy to become disconnected from reality on the ground.      Banks are well capitalized this time, so from the perspective of the financial system, that particular systemic risk appears to no longer be relevant. But there are plenty of other cracks that are currently coming under pressure. Notably, central bankers globally have few conventional options left to stimulate growth as they have pursued nothing but easy monetary policies for the last decade.      2. When the foundation itself is crumbling, a cascade of systemic failures is unnecessary to bring down the structure.      It is a known phenomenon that political leaders rely on comfortable, old fashioned frameworks when confronting novel crises. American and European leaders demonstrated this in the 1950s and 1960s, turning to World War II paradigms as they confronted a geopolitical landscape in which that thinking no longer applied. The same can be said of American leaders who responded to 9/11 by leaning on Cold War reasoning.      I believe the same is happening now with political and financial leaders in regard to 2008. “Because there is no systemic risk,” the 2008 line of reasoning goes, “the fallout will be contained.”      See also: Don’t Obsess Over Crypto End Users, We Still Need Developers to Build the Back End      But when more than three million people lose their jobs in a single week, you don’t need systemic risk to see unmitigated fallout. This may not be a financial crisis, but it is certainly an economic crisis.      3. Just because systemic failure is not occurring within the financial system does not mean it is not happening.      Just look at the health care system.      In 2008, banks were undercapitalized. This was really the root of the systemic failure that occurred. This time, it is hospitals that are overcapacity.      The overwhelming number of severe cases of coronavirus is overwhelming hospital resources around the world. Ventilators, personal protective equipment and health care workers themselves are suddenly in very short supply. This affects not only COVID-19 patients but all those who need medical attention for any reason. Pregnant women, gunshot victims, kids with broken wrists, older folks with a bad case of the run-of-the-mill flu all get affected. There’s your systemic failure.      I generally subscribe to the old adage that the most dangerous words in investing are, “This time is different.” But this time really is different from the last crisis we saw. It is so different, in fact, that we cannot take refuge [in thinking] that it does not look like 2008. That reality should not be used as a salve or a comfort but should be taken as a warning to us. If it did look like 2008, at a minimum we would be dealing with a known. Instead, we are confronting the unknown, and all of the unknown unknowns that go along with that.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,Jill Carlson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/27/dont-apply-2008-thinking-to-todays-crisis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d6ed51f8c73d750b527e23ee79a8e41179b50ef1-1200x662.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404300,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhoE5,1585309559,"Investors Regained Confidence in Bitcoin Amid Price Recovery, Data Suggests","View  A sudden bitcoin price crash similar to the one seen a few weeks ago now looks unlikely, with exchange deposits having dropped by over 30 percent in the last 12 days.  The decline in the exchange deposits suggests investors have regained confidence in the long-term viability of bitcoin, according to analysis.  A range breakdown on the four-hour chart would expose support at $6,000.  A move above $7,000 is needed to revive the recent recovery rally.    Bitcoin (BTC) may not be out of the woods yet, but prospects of another sudden price crash now look to have diminished.      The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $6,700, representing a gain of over 70 percent from the low of $3,867 seen March 13, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      While the price recovery looks impressive, there are concerns the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to another liquidity crisis in the global markets, as discussed Wednesday. Technical charts are also flashing signs of bull fatigue.      However, any decline is likely to be more measured than the violent price drop of nearly 40 percent seen on March 13, as the number of on-chain deposits to exchanges has declined significantly over the past 12 days.    Exchange deposits slide    The seven-day average of the number of transfers to exchange addresses has fallen by 35 percent from 33,303 to 21,048 over the last 12 days. Tuesday’s figure of 21,048 was the lowest level since Aug. 26, according to blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.      The transfer data is sourced from 12 major exchanges: Binance, Bitcoin.de, Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Bittrex, Coinbase, Gemini, Hitbtc, Huobi, Kraken, Okex and Poloniex.      ""It comes as no surprise that deposits on digital asset exchanges have dropped by more than 30 percent, as investor confidence took a hit after the sudden price crash seen on March 13 and many short-term traders and investors sold off their holdings to cut off what they saw as potential for further losses,"" Matthew Dibb, co-founder and COO of Stack, told CoinDesk.      Essentially, selling pressure has weakened significantly with the crowding out of weak hands (investors) and speculators.      Investors usually move coins to exchanges during bear markets and withdraw funds from exchanges during upswings. Large increases in exchange inflows are usually seen ahead of big price drops. For example, coins began flowing into exchanges at a faster rate starting from March 8 – four days ahead of the 40 percent crash observed March 12.      Non-custodial exchange CoinSwitch's CEO Ashish Singhal said the latest decline in exchange deposits is a sign investors currently are reluctant to trade or sell bitcoin at the current price and have a belief in the long-term viability of the cryptocurrency.      That could be the case. While the cryptocurrency has repeatedly failed to move past $7,000 this week, exchange deposits have continued to drop. Investors would likely have moved their coins to exchanges had they lacked confidence in the price rise.      All in all, the probability of bitcoin suffering a crash due to bulk liquidations appears quite low.      From a technical standpoint, buyers need to defend support near $6,450 that, if breached, could invite chart-driven selling.    4-hour chart    Bitcoin is teasing a rising channel breakdown at press time.      A stronger signal bearish signal would be a violation of the support at $6,458. That level marks the lower end of a sideways channel marking a four-day price consolidation.      If confirmed, a range breakdown could prompt a pullback to psychological support at $6,000.      On the higher side, $7,000 is the level to beat for the bulls. A move higher would reinvigorate the bullish trend and allow a rise to resistance range of $7,700-$7,800. Taking the drop in the exchange deposits into account, the bullish scenario looks likely.

Local councils from the counties of Pembrokeshire, Manchester and Norfolk have issued warnings to local residents against scams using the COVID-19 outbreak to exploit fear and uncertainty through text messages and emails posing as an official health organization.      Scammers are claiming to be able to provide a list of COVID-positive residents in their area for an undisclosed sum of bitcoin and are faking legitimacy by posing as the World Health Organization (WHO) as well as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).      The warnings come soon after U.K's Financial Conduct Authority warned investors that scammers may attempt to take advantage of the global pandemic crisis.      The warning was delivered on the same day the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic with more than 350,000 infected at the time.    Malicious text messages    There's also been a flurry of text messages posing as ""UKGOV"" – an apparent mimic of the official Gov.uk domain – offering a payment of £458 ($558) to all residents as part of its promise to battle COVID-19 and directing them to a malicious website via a text message link.

Out of the 21 reports, 10 were lodged by victims that had attempted to purchase face masks from deceitful sellers. One victim reported losing over £15,000 when they purchased face masks in bulk that were never delivered, echoing behavior in the U.S. from fake merchants.      Action Fraud has also received multiple reports about COVID-19 related phishing emails attempting to fool people into opening malicious attachments or revealing sensitive financial information.

42404276,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhnwN,1585299600,Coinbase's Retail Payments Wing Crosses $200M in Transactions,"Virus or not, people are still paying for goods in bitcoin (BTC).      That’s the verdict from new numbers out of Coinbase’s retailer payment portal Coinbase Commerce, which on Thursday passed a milestone in its two-year history: $200 million in total transactions processed.      That comes from a massive network: 8,000 integrated retailers now accept cryptocurrencies alongside their other payment streams. It’s a bright spot for adoption in an otherwise topsy-turvy time for bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large, which, like so much of the world, has been struggling to price in COVID-19.      Not so for merchant crypto payments, though. Commerce product lead John Zettler told CoinDesk the team hasn’t seen any change in activity over March.      Money comes more often than not in bitcoin, Zettler said. He did not provide an exact crypto-by-crypto usage breakdown, but noted bitcoin is far and away customers’ method of choice.      “Merchant customers often tell us it's the crypto they're most familiar with and the one they trust the most,” he said.      Even so, Coinbase is seeing a surge in the use of stablecoins for payment, particularly its own dollar-pegged USD Coin (USDC). USDC leads the growth pack, Zettler said. He expected to see “material growth” in stablecoin use across Q2 and Q3.      See also: Geopolitical Crisis May Benefit Oil, Gold and CBDCs, Not Bitcoin      Commerce added support for USDC in May 2019.      Coinbase plans to keep building out Commerce’s features in response to merchant demands, Zettler said. Most recently it debuted a “refunds” service, calling it the “next step” in normalizing crypto e-commerce. Crypto still has a long way to go. It remains a minuscule payment method within the hulking global e-commerce marketplace that totaled $3.5 trillion in sales in 2019.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDC,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | USDC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/27/coinbases-retail-payments-wing-crosses-200m-in-transactions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23a1a29dbcd3fd05ff51d267bda06c5a2969f374-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404283,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdho0J,1585292400,HSBC Puts $10B of Private Placements on R3's Corda Blockchain,"HSBC has put $10 billion of paper-based private placement records on R3’s Corda blockchain and plans to ramp up the project through this year and next.      “We’re confident that we’ll be able to put significant additional volume and value of private placements from new and existing clients [on the platform] over the next 12 to 18 months,” said Ciaran Roddy, head of custody innovation and strategy initiatives at HSBC.      The company had previously announced it would have $20 billion on the platform by this month. HSBC told CoinDesk that efforts to increase the functionality of the platform due to client interest are what has slowed its on-boarding push.      With no immediate plans to move into the crypto space, HSBC is focused on assets that have yet to be digitized as well as exchange-based security tokens and traditional assets that could be fractionalized. The bank is also seeing demand from clients to use tokens for a whole fund lifecycle, Roddy said, as well as tokens that are a basket of assets wrapped into one.      See also: This Unstable Moment Is a Chance for Crypto to Go Mainstream      The bank is using blockchain as opposed to a traditional database because it plans to tokenize the private placements after it digitizes them. Private placements are sales of stock shares or bonds that don’t occur on the open market.      Unlike other enterprise efforts, HSBC did not put a cost-savings estimate on the digitization project, claiming “incremental internal efficiency” instead. However, Roddy said the bank’s main aim with Corda is to get real-time information access.      “It’s more of a case of us trying to future-proof ourselves as blockchain becomes more mainstream and then also being in a position to add value to clients by providing them with self-service tools instead of them having to come to us to source the information,” he said.      The queries are usually simple, but while records are on paper, clients have to call bankers who then look up the answers to those queries. While tokenization would allow for the bank to implement tools like smart contracts, the bank first has to get issuers on board with the idea and ensure that regulators are comfortable with recognizing tokens as legal, enforceable and transferable assets.    Easy access    Clients can access the Corda platform, which the bank has dubbed “Digital Vault,” through their HSBC online accounts.      “They click on holdings and it brings up a list of all of the documents that we have stored against that particular transaction,” Roddy said.      See also: We Won’t Ever Think About the Financial System the Same Way      Clients can also grant system access to third parties like regulators and auditors. Some clients have already granted system access to their asset managers.      The bank is trying to anticipate a world in which financial entities turn to tokens as a better way of issuing assets, Roddy said.      “We’re seeing a number of [traditional] exchanges use DLT,” he said. “HSBC being a clearing member and a local depository, we want to be able to support our clients who want to transact in these [token] markets.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/27/hsbc-puts-10b-of-private-placements-on-r3s-corda-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a289ed65b68b5ac87c6aa56bebbbd8075c0087a8-1500x824.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404293,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdho9A,1585285200,Plastics Recycling Looks Promising to Enterprise Blockchain Startups,"Like the lingering bit of advice from 1967’s ""The Graduate,"" plastics as a field of opportunity is being reimagined for the blockchain age. But this time, it’s for plastics recycling.      Blockchains are proving extremely useful for tracking materials across all sorts of supply chains and creating transparent and immutable audit trails. Meanwhile, governments around the world are issuing legislation requiring retailers and plastics producers to show they are meeting minimum levels of recycling, requirements that are likely to intensify going forward.      That’s where a handful of blockchain startups see opportunity, by connecting major refining companies with new types of plastics recycling in a bid to reinvent current supply chains. Blockchain’s appeal here: measuring action and demonstrating it to the public.      Currently, only rigid plastics that go into things like bottles are mechanically recycled into lower-grade plastics, a process that can be repeated twice at the most. But a combination of clever industrial technologies is set to make plastics recycling more sophisticated over the next few years, returning the chemically altered raw materials back into the manufacturing process.      This means reducing plastic to the crude sludge from whence it came and then refining it again into any order of new products, creating a completely circular economy for a waste product that has become a scourge to the planet (as much as 12 million tons of waste plastic enters the oceans each year).      The prospect of chemically recycled plastic entering global supply chains is the next step for large oil and gas refining companies, said Juan Miguel Perez, CEO of Finboot, which uses enterprise blockchains to help firms measure and reduce their carbon footprints.    Finboot is working with Repsol, the Spanish energy giant committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050https://www.repsol.com/en/sustainability/net-zero-emissions-2050/index.cshtml. (Repsol acquired an 8 percent stake in Finboot in July of last year.)    Read more: Hyperledger Conference Shows Where Blockchain Can Fight Global Warming      Repsol, which creates polypropylene used in plastic bottles, is now looking to take the lead in plastics recycling, showing how this could demonstrably transform downstream supply chains.      “It’s a hard goal, but eventually you could show how consumer plastics from waste collection companies can be added into your supply chain as raw materials,” Miguel Pérez said. “It’s the next step in the process of tracing assets and linking supply chains.”      Repsol was not ready to comment on its chemical plastics recycling at this time.    Mining the wasteland    U.K.-based startup Circulor is also looking at tracing recycled plastic across supply chains, going beyond the work it’s doing with conflict minerals like cobalt.      “I’m very excited about plastic waste,” said Circulor CEO Doug Johnson-Poensgen. “In many European countries, governments are proposing taxes on retailers who sell plastic which doesn't contain a minimum of 30 percent recycled. The obvious thing that’s required is a way to prove it, which is what blockchains can do.”      Read more: Everledger Looks Beyond Blood Diamonds With ESG Supply Chain Collaboration      The same issue is faced at an oil refinery, he said. “The challenge for the oil majors like Total and BP is that if you are producing all these plastic materials, how much of it is recycled? This is why traceability is an important part of that.”      The chemical recycling of plastic is the future, said Johnson-Poensgen, and the proper infrastructure to do this is gradually being put in place, adding that Circulor is “scoping out” a project with U.K.-based Recycling Technologies, which manufactures the equipment to chemically recycle plastic.      Recycling Technologies, which this month received backing from Neste, the world’s leading provider of renewable diesel and jet fuel, creates seed stock for new plastic production. This also improves on mechanical means by incorporating so-called soft plastics, which generally end up in landfills or simply bleed into the environment, said Recycling Technologies marketing manager Lisa Zafferani.      Her company uses a system of thermal cracking, turning waste plastic into a gas which can then be distilled into an oil and refined by a petrochemical firm, in the same way crude oil from the ground is refined.      “I think what is really interesting for the waste and recycling industry is how you can use technology like blockchain to trace plastic waste in those processes of recycling and the output from them,” Zafferani said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/27/plastics-recycling-looks-promising-to-enterprise-blockchain-startups,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1b075c0255599197346ed9e5ddd51705c337daff-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404290,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdho7C,1585278000,Block.one Absorbs Team Behind Now-Defunct Block Producer EOS New York,"EOS creator Block.one has acquired the team behind once-prominent block producer EOS New York, which has now entirely ceased operations.      Block.one, which raised more than $4 billion in a yearlong initial coin offering (ICO) in 2018, said Wednesday it had hired EOS New York founders Rick Schlesinger and Kevin Rose, as well as their team. Block.one says the former EOS New York staffers will work on community outreach initiatives.      “In our new role, we plan to listen to and work with communities to leverage Block.one’s digital asset positions to maximize the health and security of various public networks,” Schlesinger and Rose said in a statement.      EOS New York was one of the most prominent of the first generation of block producers – the 21-largest entities, by staking amount, that secure the EOS blockchain. BPs contributed to the governance of the network.      When it came time to replace the interim constitution, EOS New York proposed the simplified EOS User Agreement (EUA) which, among other things, omitted a clause that prohibited BPs from buying votes from the community.      Passed in April 2019, new entities started promising token holders a share of the block reward in return for their votes. Many original BPs quickly lost market share, with EOS New York falling from fourth place to 33rd by the end of October 2019, for example.      Read more: On EOS Blockchain, Vote Buying Is Business as Usual      Accusations of poor governance abounded: Former EOS backer Brock Pierce said in August that network governance had become a ""Chinese oligarchy."" EOS Tribe, another original BP, said in September it was leaving EOS altogether, complaining corruption and back-room vote-buying deals had led to a ""mediocre performance"" and failed transactions.      In November, EOS New York said it had discovered that six current BPs were actually controlled by a single entity. Still, vote-buying on EOS continues to grow unabated; new services have even popped-up making it easier for BPs to distribute block rewards with those who voted for them.      Since settling with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last September, Block.one has begun awarding grants to projects that benefit the EOS ecosystem. It is also developing a social network, Voice.      A Block.one spokesperson told CoinDesk that it only acquired the team and had not carried over any of EOS New York's block producer operations or tokens.      EOS New York, and its affiliates, have now ceased operations entirely. Their website has been replaced with Wednesday's announcement and their name has been struck from the list of block producer candidates.
