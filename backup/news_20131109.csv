42376650,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bbm9,1384001874,"Shopify officially integrates bitcoin as a payment option for its 70,000+ merchants","Popular e-commerce platform Shopify announced earlier today it would add a bitcoin payment option for its sellers. With a base of over 70,000 online stores, the number of goods that can potentially be purchased with bitcoin has expanded once again.  With current values putting 1 BTC at almost $340, bitcoin has moved back onto the mainstream radar. Acceptance by a large commercial presence like Shopify could see even more heads and opinions turn bitcoin's way.  Bitcoin payments via BitPay will be offered as an option for merchants immediately*, but they will need to request activation themselves. Several Shopify merchants and their customers have been lobbying for bitcoin integration for some time, though, and the response to the announcement was overwhelmingly positive.  Shopify representative Brian Alkerton posted the following on the company's user forum:  ""Just a quick update on this: our BitPay integration is feature-complete and can be added to your store now. Due to the fact that it's a very new feature and not something we're ready to roll out to all stores just yet, you will need to contact me to have it enabled, and I may want to follow up with you for your feedback once you've been using it for a while, but it works. When active, BitPay will appear as a credit card processor in the Checkout page of your shop admin - enter your access key and you'll be all set to go.""  He added that since BitPay would be considered the same as a credit card processor option like Authorize.net and Stripe, the two could not be used together ""at this time"". Only PayPal Express Checkout could still be used in conjunction with BitPay.  Alkerton also posted on Reddit that bitcoin integration was ""something our dev team has built as an initial testbed to potentially evaluate future applications. The implementation is limited for now but we are working on improving it.""  European bitcoin payment processor BIPS also announced last month they would offer bitcoin integration to Shopify merchants, and posted an instructional guide on how to set it up. Shopify's new 'official' solution is likely to be more popular though, through its inclusion in the Shopify administrative interface and its use of BitPay, which has been the preferred option for US-based businesses.  Another payment processor, Bitcredits.io, has also developed a bitcoin payment system that integrates with Shopify and works in conjunction with Stripe and PayPal. It is currently in private beta due for release in a couple of weeks, and has already been deployed by a merchants including home solar products seller yetisolar.com.  Shopify, based in Ottawa, Canada, was launched in 2006 and is now available for use in any country, currency or language (though the administrative interface is English-only). It has often been praised by both merchants and customers for its 100+ clean and easy to use templates to organize merchants' storefront and products, as well as process payments and track orders.  There are also tutorials to get novice sellers started, and forums for all sellers to communicate with each other and the company. Sellers represent all parts of the retail spectrum, from food to clothing and even art and crafts.  *Update: Shopify has delayed further deployment for a day or two to fix a bug with order handling, but is still taking merchant requests for the system.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/09/shopify-officially-integrates-bitcoin-as-a-payment-option-for-its-70000-merchants,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9419d2838b523b706ce33b77e811836d186374d-1483x948.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376642,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bbdL,1383994616,Canada Revenue Agency says tax rules apply to bitcoin,"The Canada Revenue Agency issued an official release on how to treat bitcoin and other virtual currencies for taxation this week after signalling its intent to do so back in May.  The guidance gives tax advisors working with Canadian bitcoin companies something to go on when working within the bitcoin space. Although it contains no new information, it does reinforce the CRA’s previous statement on the subject.  The fact sheet, entitled ‘What you should know about Digital Currency’, is a very brief outline that simply states that tax rules apply when it is used to pay for goods and services in the same way the rules for barter transactions apply and links to the CRA’s rules on Barter Transactions after defining barter transaction and giving an example of buying movie tickets.  The CRA also points out that since digital currency can be traded like a commodity, any resulting gains can be treated as taxable income or capital for the taxpayer and links to an archived document on Transactions in Securities.  Pokerati.com’s  ‘Gaming Council’ goes into the document in some depth to establish how bitcoin income might relate to the Income Tax Act quoting that: “the salary, wages and other remuneration including gratuities received by the taxpayer during the year are taxable just as they might be if they were received in US dollars, UK pounds or euros”.  Unfortunately the guidelines as published do not address the issues surrounding the taxation of bitcoin mining, and whether bitcoin will be treated as a currency for mining purposes or like gold or silver.  But the Gaming Council goes on to say they believe the CRA is “making this more complicated than it needs to be.""  ""If bitcoin is used as an actual functioning currency, then there’s no reason to have to resort to the barter rules,” says the council, explaining that the taxation of mining might become clearer if transactions could be translated on the day of occurrence using a reasonable exchange rate between bitcoin and Canadian dollars.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | REGULATION,Richard Boase,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/09/canada-revenue-agency-says-tax-rules-apply-to-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2899827a6d7a3d43adbb0c65f436e82efb8f4909-1000x664.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
