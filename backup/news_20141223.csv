42398092,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbM9vQ,1419376234,E-Commerce Software Developer Ziftr Raises $600k in Altcoin Crowdsale,"One of the big questions about digital currency is whether or not the technology will be utilized on a broader scale by the spending public.  Those who foresee a rise in use by consumers argue that it’s only a matter of time before existing payment mechanisms are supplanted by bitcoin or another digital currency, while those more critical of this area of adoption counter that many spenders will be loath to give up their cash and credit cards for a crypto alternative.  The nature of this debate hasn’t stopped some from betting on the embrace of digital currency by consumers. Over the past two weeks, Ziftr, a US-based e-commerce solutions provider, has raised more than $600,000 during a crowdsalehttps://www.ziftrcoin.com/presale/ of its own altcoin, ziftrcoin, which the company is pitching as a user-friendly alternative to bitcoin.  Backers of the project include 10x Venture Partners, a seed-stage fund based in Merrimack, New Hampshire, that purchased $150,000 worth of ziftrcoins at the start of the crowdsale and has made previous investments in Ziftr.  Ziftr recently completed work on ziftrPAY, an API that enables merchants to accept a variety of cryptocurrencies as well as traditional payment methods. According to CEO Bob Wilkins, the company is also developing a broader range of services that can help bring cryptocurrencies to the mainstream by facilitating merchant acceptance.  Wilkins said in a new interview that he hopes ziftrcoin will provide a vehicle for more consumers to get into digital currencies, and explained that several elements of the project, including a planned social-mining initiative that incorporates some of the design elements of ziftrcoin, are aimed at achieving this goal.  He told CoinDesk:  “We want to onboard the next 10 million consumers into [digital currency].”  VC interest in cryptocurrency  10x Venture Partners manager John Gargasz said that his firm participated in the crowdsale because it has faith in the project given the developments in digital currency over the past few years, as well as an existing working relationship with Ziftr.  Gargasz explained:  “In the cryptocurrency space, which is highly volatile and forming day by day, a big part of what you invest in is the team and your trust in them. Knowing Bob, we have that trust in him.”  He said that growing interest among the venture capital ecosystem in digital currencies drew his company to look for new opportunities.  “We watched [digital currency] for a couple of years as its been forming up, and feel like it is a fundamentally new network and new market for financial transactions,” Gargasz told CoinDesk. “We felt like now is the time to start stepping into it.”  Gargasz added that 10x Ventures plans on pursuing other projects that involve digital currency and is currently exploring several early-stage initiatives for potential support.  Pitching altcoins to merchants  While a number of both high profile and everyday merchants have integrated digital currency payments, there continues to be a certain level of apprehension among business owners about whether or not to accept them.  Wilkins argued that while merchants are intrigued by the technology, people tend to focus on whether one particular cryptocurrency – whether bitcoin or an alternative – will be successful in the long run. The optimal approach, he said, is giving merchants the option to accept a variety of coins based on the preferences of their customers.  He continued:  “The hard part [merchants] are having is what coin to bet on. We don’t know which coin is going to be the true coin that becomes stable. What we are able to say is, our API will work with what’s out there now and what’s coming up, so you don’t have to choose one.”  Wilkins explained that Ziftr is taking steps to shore up merchant confidence in the value of ziftrcoin, including a $1 redemption guarantee when purchases are made on ziftrSHOP, the company’s online directory of merchants. The company has also released a branded, multi-coin wallet.  Looking ahead  According to Wilkins, plans for the project’s future include building out its merchant-focused infrastructure, which includes inking partnerships with exchanges to provide more liquidity to the system. The company also plans to distribute 300 million ziftrcoins as part of a promotional campaign later next year.  When asked about the project’s 4.5% pre-mine – which includes the 300m set for public distribution – Wilkins said that funds set aside for employees and advisors to the project are locked, with the first tranche of 25m ziftrcoins unavailable for the first year. He added that Ziftr welcomes transparency about the funds.  To support the project, Ziftr is developing a social-mining platform, on which users can form groups and mine ziftrcoins together. Wilkins said that the platform is aimed at providing information to interested parties as well as a means to generate ziftrcoins, explaining:  “The idea around the algorithm we use for ziftrcoin, 'sign-to-mine', was to make it easier for a group of people to say, 'Hey, look, I kind of want to get into this'. We're starting to develop this really easy user interface that's kind of social in nature, where people can come in and mine together.”  Sign-to-mine, according to the ziftrcoin white paper, requires the miner that solves a block to also sign the transaction in order to be able to spend those coins. This approach opens the network up to certain block-processing attacks, including 'selfish mining', the paper explains, but goes on to state that other elements help prevent such attacks.  Wilkins voiced optimism about the future of the project, stating that the goal is to make tools available on the market for merchants to accept digital currencies and electronic payment methods more simply. Wilkins said that his team is focused on reaching out to merchants and has aggressive plans for growth once the crowdsale has concluded.  “After the crowdsale is done, it’s all about rolling as hard and fast as we can and signing up 1,000 merchants before next Black Friday,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | ZRX,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/12/23/e-commerce-software-developer-ziftr-raises-600k-in-altcoin-crowdsale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/955a2e287dda1e7220540d918c8a1b6a3e7b8e28-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398093,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbM9rU,1419336519,Bitcoin Predictions for 2014: How the Pundits Fared,"If there was one word that could describe bitcoin over the past year, it would be 'unpredictable'. So, with that in mind and armed with 20/20 hindsight at year's end, it's fun to go back and look at all the people who tried to do just that.  Whether they prognosticated over the entrails of dead animals or defunct bitcoin exchanges, actual data or emotional investment, the results were – perhaps unsurprisingly – often far off the mark.  A large majority of bitcoin fortune-tellers focused on whether the price would go stratospheric or tank, but other more thoughtful commentators looked at other aspects of the digital currency ecosystem, such as venture investment, politics, or emergence of alternative currencies.  Let's look at what the pundits predicted for bitcoin in 2014.  Price predictions  To put this year's price projections into context, they were made at a time when bitcoin's price had risen from under $100 to over $1,000 in a matter of months. Bitcoin had just emerged from Silk Road's shadow, its critics found themselves on mute, and positive media coverage meant even non-technological family members were beginning to ask about bitcoin.  Rather than make predictions ourselves, CoinDesk outsourced the task to readers with a poll right as the new year rolled in, and one bitcoin was worth $775.  The result was that 56% of the 5,500 respondents expected bitcoin's price to hit $10,000 before the end of the year. 31%, however, thought this unlikely and 13% responded ""WTF are you smokin'?""  A Bank of America Merrill Lynch report in December 2013 said the bitcoin price ""will stabilize around $1,300 per coin very soon"".  Jason Hamlin of GoldStockBull penned a hopeful vision of $1,800 gold, a pardon for Edward Snowden and bitcoins for ""$2,500 or higher"" in 2014.  To be fair, not everyone who made a prediction about bitcoin in the past 12 months did so with a definite timeframe in mind, like the Winklevoss brothers' vision of a $400bn bitcoin market cap... someday.  Getting closer  In the midst of such a mood, predicting anything other than a never-ending bull run for bitcoin would have been seen as treasonous by digital currency's faithful social media followers. However, although there were definitely more level-headed expectations that probably struck closer to the target, they did not grab headlines at the time.  Some more sober projections emerged after the Mt Gox and People's Bank of China smoke had cleared a little.  Founder and CEO of Gyft, Vinny Lingham, posted a thoughtful analysis in April, where he said the price would stablize between $350–550. This was due in part to merchant acceptance moving faster than that of consumers, and the fact that most are still unable to define what bitcoin is.  ""In the not too distant future, entrepreneurs & technologists will use the actual bitcoins themselves in new and interesting ways (think smart contracts, etc.) —how many will be ultimately needed is unknown, and that’s what creates the imbalance in price. Right now it’s all speculation as to what that future value of a bitcoin will equate to.""  The only other prediction we found that came anywhere near bitcoin's actual current price in the $300s was on BitBet – and it was referring to Christmas 2013.  The bears  The rapture of one year ago didn't stop some, however, from foretelling certain doom for the ""unbacked"" new currency.  One of the bitcoin community's favorite whipping boys is Boston University School of Management professor Mark T. Williams, also known derisively as 'Professor Bitcorn' for his pessimistic outlook on cryptocurrency.  Williams' own prediction was courageous in its short scope, which was bound to bring either victory or derision swiftly: he predicted in December 2013 that the price of bitcoin could go as low as $10 by the middle of the following year.  While his prognosis was arguably closer than most of the bullish statements, bitcoin also went nowhere near the double digits and Williams' quote went into the same reserve pile as economist Paul Krugman's 1998 dismissal of the new Internet economy's significance.  In May, however, Williams told CoinDesk he still believed bitcoin was ""grossly overpriced"" and that his $10 estimate would still come to pass at some point in future.  Blackstone Group  vice chairman Byron Wien has long been fond of finishing the year with predictions. While he hit the mark as a fiat currency soothsayer by saying the Japanese yen would fall to 120 per US dollar, his crystal ball was less accurate on both bitcoin value and utility:  ""During the year bitcoin’s acceptance collapses as investors realize that it cannot be used as collateral in financial transactions and its principal utility is for illegal business dealings where anonymity is important.""  Having endured the subsequent Mt Gox collapse and its tortuous aftermath, Chinese and Russian legal uncertainty, BitLicenses, tax rulings and price slumps, bitcoin users will now have their confidence tested again by predictions for 2015. Will they be accurate?  Half-year predictions  Price overestimates, however, weren't confined to the heady days of December 2013. As recently as July this year, some could still see a four-figure bitcoin value within months.  CoinTelegraph posted a video in May that polled various bitcoin community figures on their opinions, with often hilarious results.  Founders Fund partner Geoff Lewis, speaking at London's CoinSummit event, predicted a price of $2,000. He added he will be ""really bullish when there is low volatility"", but estimated the value would soar to $2,000 or more in the next five months.  Bitcoin evangelist Roger Ver, well-known as a price bull, said Lewis hadn't gone far enough – though in Ver's defense, he didn't set a deadline and thus cannot be called out this time.  ""I actually think $2,000 is a pretty conservative estimate ... we don't know for sure if it's going to happen in this year, but there's no doubt in my mind that bitcoin's price is going to be thousands of dollars and, almost for sure, tens of thousands of dollars for one.""  Lightspeed India's list  Lightspeed Venture Partners' India office (LVPI) made a bold list of predictions in January that covered a broad spectrum of cryptocurrency issues beyond just price, and was shared widely around the bitcoin world.  While the list claimed bitcoin's price was ""likely to range between $4,000-5,000 by the end of 2014"", we'll set that aside for now and focus on its more interesting prophecies.  Lightspeed's early prediction that $100m in venture capital would flow into bitcoin startups was actually pretty conservative by comparison, given than $91.8 had already done so in 2013.  In reality, by the time of CoinDesk's Q3 State of Bitcoin Report appeared in October, over $290m had poured into bitcoin companies – and that was before Blockchain announced its $30.5m investment, along with Blockstream's $21m, PeerNova's $8.6m and others.  LVPI predicted the 'browser of bitcoin' would arrive in 2014, doing for digital currency what Netscape did for mass acceptance of the web in the early 1990s, and that blockchain-based services beyond those relating to currency and payments would emerge.  While more user-friendly services like Circle have launched to make bitcoin more familiar to those raised in a fiat/online banking world, and exchanges like Xapo, ANX and CoinJar now allow users to use everyday debit cards to fund their account balances, obtaining that first bitcoin remains a cumbersome process of setup and ID verification for most.  ChangeTip, armed with a new $3.5m in seed funding, is trying to make those initial steps into bitcoin easier – but as yet, it's difficult to say bitcoin has had its 'Netscape moment'.  Non-currency (or 'crypto 2.0') projects did continue to develop and emerge, including asset exchange platforms like Hyperledger, Counterparty, Melotic and NXT Asset Exchange. New 'smart contract' projects like Ethereum and Ripple Labs' Codius also appeared only in the past year.  Another notable LVPI prediction went as follows:  ""There will be less than five altcoins (out of the 50+ in existence) that will survive 2014""  This was orders of magnitude off, as alts continued to proliferate this year. CoinMarketCap now lists over 500 cryptocurrencies and that number seems to rise and fall every week.  The prediction above ran counter to many others, which said there would be a growing interest in non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies. CoinDesk, too, predicted a ""growing interest in altcoins"".  Developers seeking to trump bitcoin on technology, features, utility and economic model (as well as speculators looking for another chance at early adopter status) cranked out altcoins at such a rate that CoinDesk's regular All Things Alt feature could barely keep up.  Consultant and author Tim Swanson wrote frequently that the number of digital currencies would grow, not shrink, saying in a paper that greater opportunities of financial reward for developers working on new coins, plus a glut of mining gear no longer suitable for supporting the bitcoin network, would see the number of alts continue to grow.  LVPI's final prediction? ""Satoshi Nakamoto will be Time’s Person of the Year 2014."" Well, perhaps spooked by Newsweek's ill-fated venture into that territory, Time went instead with a safer – yet very deserved – collective award to those fighting ebola in West Africa.  Bitcoin acceptance  CoinDesk's first State of Bitcoin report for 2014 said ""Adoption by more large consumer-facing companies (eg: Overstock and Zynga) will introduce bitcoin to a wider audience"".  Whether more merchant acceptance has led to an increase in actual bitcoin use is still debatable, as decreased purchasing power led many bitcoin users to hold, rather than spend, their coins. There is little doubt, however, that bitcoin acceptance by marquee corporate names has kept digital currency in the headlines in 2014.  After a rapid conversion to bitcoin around the beginning of the year, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne said in an interview with CNN that rival Amazon would be ""forced"" to accept bitcoin soon.  Although Byrne didn't specify a timeframe for this, Amazon responded to growing pressure from bitcoiners by quashing the idea altogether in April, saying it has no plans to ""engage bitcoin"".  While that might seem like bad news, few predicted that other corporate giants like Dell, DISH, Time Inc and Microsoft would be accepting bitcoin by the end of 2014, each giving the currency a much-needed legitimacy boost.  Brave new world  That few predictions really foresaw what happened in 2014 reminds us of one important fact: nothing like bitcoin has ever existed before.  Never in history have people had the technology to transfer wealth instantly, anywhere in the world, without trusted third-party intermediaries or restrictions based on logistics, cost, or regulation.  What the world will do with this new ability can only be approximated by defering to history and existing models. While we salute anyone brave enough to prophesize a bitcoin future that can be reviewed 12 months from now, it's important to not rely on them too heavily when making major investment or career decisions.

42398085,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbM9pW,1419302573,Burning Man Accepts Bitcoin Donations for Year-Round Activities,"Burning Man, the organization best known for its annual week-long celebration of cutting-edge culture in Nevada's Black Rock Desert, has announced it is accepting bitcoin donations to extend its reach.  While ticket sales to the 'Black Rock City' event generally cover production costs, donations will help cover Burning Man's growing year-round program of other activities, including Global Art Grants program, the Big Art for Small Towns program and art honorariums.  Donations will be processed through Coinbase.  Burning Man  CEO Marian Goodell said:  ""Donations will help provide more grants, training and support to creators of radically interactive art and events on and off the playa, fund civic programs, teach communities the power of collaboration, strengthen our infrastructure and make the Burning Man experience accessible year-round.""  Accepting bitcoin for donations is an experimental first step, she added. While Burning Man is not accepting bitcoin payments for tickets just yet, it plans to explore that and other possibilities in the future.  Burning Man is a recognized non-profit organization, and as such donations are tax-deductable. More details on the exact programs to be fundable with bitcoin are available on its website.  Tech culture icon  Burning Man has long been a highlight on the tech culture and Silicon Valley calendar, so embracing cutting-edge finance would seem like a logical step. It joins other notable organisations, such as Wikipedia and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, in accepting bitcoin donations.  Spokesperson Jim Graham told CoinDesk that a number of participants and team members over the years had asked whether Burning Man would accept bitcoin.  ""We've had two in-house advocates championing it. You probably know that Burning Man attracts a broad range of tech people and early adopters. It made sense for us to explore the idea and look at donations to the non-profit as a starting point.""  How bitcoin will work  All bitcoin donations will be converted to dollars upon receipt. Coinbase was chosen, Goodell said, because its platform is robust, secure, and does not charge fees to non-profits.  Burning Man, she added, ""has been a crucible of innovation for nearly 30 years"", and seamless, fee-less bitcoin transactions will give people the widest variety of options for supporting its culture out in the world.  The organisation also supports civic art programs and volunteer group Burners Without Borders, and provides grants for community initiatives. Around the world, Burning Man facilitates a regional network of more than 250 volunteer contacts on five continents, hosts an annual Global Leadership Conference and a European Leadership Conference – scheduled this year for February 2015.  Background  The Burning Man event, which began as a San Francisco beach festival in 1986, grew steadily over the years and, in 2014, attracted nearly 66,000 attendees.  The Burning Man organisation has a mission ""to facilitate and extend the culture that has issued from the Burning Man event into the larger world. This culture forms an integrated pattern of values, experience, and behaviour: a coherent and widely applicable way of life"".  Its programs are designed to increase self-reliance, civic involvement, creative capacity, sharing and inclusion.
