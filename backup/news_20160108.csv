42398849,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh0cX,1452289056,CFTC to Discuss Blockchain Tech During Public Hearing,"UPDATE 2 (9th February 16:20 BST): The CFTC has announced that its Technology Advisory Committee will meet on 23rd February to discuss blockchain technology.      The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) will discuss the application of blockchain technology in derivatives markets during a meeting of its Technology Advisory Committee later this month.  According to a notice published today, the hearing will take place on 26th January at the agency’s Washington, DC headquarters. The meeting is open to the public.  The notice states:  ""The TAC will discuss: (1) the Commission's proposed Regulation Automated Trading (""Reg AT""); (2) swap data standardization and harmonization; and (3) blockchain and the potential application of distributed ledger technology to the derivatives market.""  The agency said that it any written statements submitted to the committee will be published later on the CFTC website.  The hearing comes months after the CFTC declared its intent to regulate bitcoin and other digital currencies as commodities.  That decision was tied to an enforcement action against a bitcoin options trading platform. The agency settled charges later that month with bitcoin swap execution facility TeraExchange over alleged violations of the Commodity Exchange Act.

42398842,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh0Ve,1452284618,Controversial Neo & Bee CEO Resurfaces After Disappearance,"The long-lost CEO of what was once one of the most hyped bitcoin startups has resurfaced online after a near two-year absence from the community.  Danny Brewster, the founder and CEO of Cyprus-based bitcoin banking startup Neo & Bee, is now tweeting from his former Twitter handle @BtcDanny, with messages including promises that he intends to reimburse investors for losses incurred during what can be best described as a contentious period of company turmoil at the start of 2014.  During that time, an arrest warrant was issued for Brewster, who faced allegations from law enforcement in Cyprus that he had defrauded at least two customers who paid €35,000 for bitcoins never received.  The @BtcDanny account issued its first tweet in almost two years on 31st December, and in follow-up messages, Brewster has suggested investors may soon “get everything back”, phrasing that implies he intends to reimburse those who invested in the crowdfunded startup.  In a statement to CoinDesk, Brewster reiterated the claims, adding that more information on their validity will be available at a later date.  Brewster said:  ”I have every intention of getting things settled with the business and anything that is possible payed to investors as per the original agreement like I have been fighting to do for almost two years.”  The claims received mixed responses on Twitter, with some encouraging Brewster to repay investors and others casting doubt given Brewster’s troubled track record in the industry.  Brewster first solicited money from online bitcoin users in June 2013 for the idea of a bitcoin bank, with the idea attracting its first local media headlines by August.  Neo & Bee had intended to raise 24,600 BTC for its operations at a time when the currency was worth roughly $120. Shares then were publicly traded via Panama-based Havelock Investments, a platform for the trading of bitcoin-denominated shares in companies before being halted amid company turmoil.  Brewster maintains that the company is still active and that it may soon emerge from a period of legal proceedings, though a number of former employees have resigned.  Complicated history  Soon after the arrest warrant was issued for Brewster, former employees began coming forward to offer their versions of the events at the company.  At the time, employees gave statements to CoinDesk that included allegations Brewster absconded with corporate funds and lost money in the collapse of bitcoin exchange Mt Gox.  Theories abound as to the exact state of the startup’s finances at the time, with employees disclosing battles with Brewster over the alleged lack of clarity he was providing on the company’s financial situation. Documents provided to CoinDesk at the time were inconclusive at painting a full picture of the startup's finances.  Employees say Brewster then flew to the UK in an attempt to seek investment, without, they said, appointing a decision-maker to lead the operations. Employees would later resign from the company amid what they described as confusion over direction.  Brewster ultimately did not return to Cyprus citing email threats against himself and his family, though how long he was gone is unclear. Since then, Brewster's whereabouts have been an irregular discussion topic on community forums.  Brewster did, however, suggest that the warrant was still active, but hinted that he is contesting the order. He further contends that the initial article by The Cyprus Mail detailing the warrant for his arrest remains inaccurate.

42398840,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh0Tg,1452281076,ESMA Event Explores Blockchain Impact on Mainstream Finance,"The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) held a financial innovation event in Paris on 16th December, during which the topic of blockchain and distributed ledger technology was discussed.  According to details of the event published by ESMA, participants conversed about the potential impact of the blockchain on mainstream financial services. The agency first issued a call for information on the technology in April 2015.  During opening remarks, Jean-Paul Servais of Belgium’s Financial Services and Markets Authority touched on the subject, pointing to both the risks and opportunities brought about as more financial firms consider using the technology.  ""There could be opportunities here, but clearly also risks while these mechanisms are not well understood and generally operating outside regulation,"" he said.  Later, Adrian Blundell-Wignall, a special advisor to the intergovernmental economic group Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), remarked that, from his perspective, the risk of digital currencies being used by terrorist financiers warrants stricter regulation, but not at the expense of innovation.  ""Terrorism finance, money laundering and illicit trade are all reasons to strictly regulate this space. However, we need to be careful not to curb the technological innovation in this area,"" he said.  A panel held during the event focused specifically on distributed ledgers, asking the question: ""Will [they] materially disrupt the existing trade lifecycle?""  Participants included UBS Lab chief Alex Batlin, Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters, Setl COO Peter Randall, ECB senior advisor Wiebe Ruttenberg and Federal Reserve Board macroeconomic analysis chief John Schindler.  In closing remarks, ESMA executive director Verena Ross touched on aspects of the talk:  ""Based on our discussion, we believe that the technology may well help with streamlining post-trading services, reducing costs and increasing security and transparency in the financial system. Yet, for this to happen, a number of challenges, including around privacy and governance issues, will need to be addressed. The transition to the new system may also prove complex and resource intensive.""  ""We as regulators should prepare for those changes to come,"" Ross added.

42398846,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh0aZ,1452278660,P2P Bitcoin Lender Seeks Market Traction in Brazil,"Bitcoin lending startup Bitbond is seeking to gain traction in Portugal and Brazil as it looks to grow its user base in 2016.  The Berlin-based company, which has raised €800,000 ($870,000) in two public funding rounds, is currently competing against startups such as BitLendingClub and BTCJam in the peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin lending market, as well as as against other FinTech alternatives.  Bitbond  cited the high number of small businesses, high barriers to working capital and informal reports of bitcoin's growing traction as an investment vehicle in the country. According to its estimates, 600 of its 23,000 users are already living in Brazil and Portugal.  The company has hired a new team member to help translate the Bitbond website into Portuguese and assist it as it looks to “overcome the language and culture hurdles” inherent in this strategy.  “This appointment is indicative of the huge potential these countries have and Bitbond's desire to bring our product to key markets,” Bitbond’s online marketing manager, Chris Grundy, told CoinDesk.  The news comes as lawmakers in Brazil continue to meet and discuss regulation and local universities have begun experimenting with the emerging technology.

42398852,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh0dW,1452269162,2015 Was Do or Die for Bitcoin Miners But Promise Lies Ahead,"2015 continued the trend: as the price of bitcoin fell and mining difficulty rose, miners were forced to sell both their bitcoin holdings and newly mined bitcoins to cover operating expenses and fuel growth.  This increased downward pressure on the price of bitcoin, and gives us all a painful reminder of how this network is designed with respect to miners: bitcoin punishes the greedy and the weak.  Just as in 2014, we saw attrition in mining operations (and among manufacturers) – the less favorable economic conditions meant many were unable to survive. The explosion of hashrate coming from China eclipsed operations in other parts of the world, and we quickly found the conditions at which many operations had to 'blink first'.  First-mover (dis)advantage  Early leaders in the ASIC market found themselves lagging newer players, and in a declining market, struggling to find the funds to maintain their position.  To carry the same market share, industrial-sized operations needed to increase from 3-5MW to 30-50MW.  It becomes readily apparent that block rewards for mining are simply a subsidy designed to return on the investment in network security, not to produce long term revenues. Mining is now a race to see who will hold the biggest marketshare when the network transitions to a fee-based system.  Nobody loves bitcoin  In 2015, the market decided it didn't like bitcoin anymore and the focus turned to the blockchain, its underlying distributed ledger.  This was silly, of course, because the two go hand in hand.  What the market was really saying was that it was unhappy that the bitcoin price didn't hold up. In retrospect what happened to the price makes total sense: more mining was being done than was necessary to support the transactions being made.  Bitcoin production rates are essentially fixed, but difficulty is not.  So we drove ourselves to the brink in our attempts to grab marketshare, couldn’t (or wouldn’t) continue growing and waited for prices to rise again.  Mining is a commodity business and its inherent price sensitivity was never more apparent (let this be a lesson to you).  Usher in the blockchain: a distributed ledger system with super cheap transactions and almost costless auditing – recording exchanges of value via a digital token.  Indeed it's very cool tech – but then I just described bitcoin, didn't I?  Block-size debate  Perhaps the most annoying question we asked ourselves this year was whether to raise the limit on the number of transactions that can be written into data blocks on the bitcoin blockchain.  I was against this can-kicking, central bank-esque meddling from the beginning. I stood before the Satoshi Roundtable in February and proclaimed my intent to just mine for rewards, leaving transactions out of my blocks completely.  This of course ""stirred debate"", but I think I got my point across. With almost no revenue coming from fees, miners have literally no incentive to mess with transactions.  During the transaction spam ""stress testing"", we witnessed this same idea as a defensive tactic – full blocks impact pool performance, causing orphans, or valid blocks that aren't included on the main chain, meaning miners who mine them don't get the rewards.  With such low fee revenue, these transactions now become a liability.  Think about what a single missed block costs a pool operator. At $450, we make $11,250 for processing a block. If instead those transactions cost us $11,250 well, you can see the motivation.  Now, speaking of motivation, bitcoin has always been a system whereby miners vote for protocol changes by taking (or not taking) a particular BIP. This provides a consensus mechanism for change to the network only when there is a measurable (read: financial) incentive to a majority of the mining hashpower.  Maybe now it's clear why we don't have consensus on the issue.  So what if we don't take the BIP? The ever-rising daily transaction count will soon fill all the blocks and then we will have competition for transaction clearing. This will raise fees.  The shoe may be on the other foot at that point – startups with poorly conceived business models based on super-low transaction fees may be the next to fail. But it's possible that projects like sidechains or the Lightning Network will provide aggregation solutions.  In a few years, perhaps only the largest aggregators will be able to afford to post transaction data to the main chain.  This all sounds very painful, but it's actually a great and elegant and terrible evolutionary process happening all at once. It has the effect of taking out the garbage, so to speak.  Optimizing expenses  This old saw again.  For miners, 2016 requires further optimization of operational expenditures, in addition to the need to transition away from less efficient hardware.  Even with very low power costs, miners need to move to the better gear in order to survive. Once you have very cheap power, where does a miner go?  I intend to spend 2016 pursuing more free power, and developing a 'net-zero' power cost business model. This can be achieved when you operate at megawatt scale and have a large 'controllable power load'.  Where in the world can you run your old hardware that costs more in power than it makes in bitcoin? There are places.  MegaBigPower is rolling out a new offering for this old stuff to get a second life. This follows our continued efforts to find ways to monetize this equipment rather than see it heading to landfills.  Competition at industrial scale  My first industrial-scale ASIC project achieved 100 terahashes and we began the deployment when the global network itself was 100TH.  So, by the time we got it all running, we had something like 25% of the network. To attempt this same feat again will require some 750 petahashes, or 5.4 million of BitFury’s new chip.  Will it happen? Yes, definitely – and more no doubt. As bitcoin prices rise, the system has room for more mining.  But since we are greedy humans, we will overproduce, difficulty will rise, profits will fall, putting pressure on the price and the whole cycle will repeat again…  Don't overlook what has happened, though. Bitcoin and its blockchain have become even more robust and more secure as a result.  Corporate integration  With this newfound security and robustness, the network has greater value and eventually price will rise as a result of renewed investment and trust.  As the price rises, so does market capitalization and so does the amount of revenue to be had from processing transactions.  Right now, I estimate the 12-month revenue potential, if one could do all the mining, at about $700m.  When the mining market can pay billions, larger companies are going to take a serious look at this. Companies that already have assets such as power generation and capital resources will task their very smart power managers to build long-term strategies around large, controllable power loads, hedging and energy storage systems.  These companies will begin to see how mining (transaction processing) can 'plug in' to their existing business and even subsidize poorly performing assets. I’ve personally seen signs that this process is beginning already and will accelerate in 2016.  The good news here is that the security and value of the network can continue to grow even as it remains decentralized.  2015 was a year that tested our resolve as miners and forced us to adapt or die.  I believe 2016 carries more potential for the business of transaction processing than ever before, but it may not look anything like we thought it would back in the heyday of 2013.  The same goes for the blockchain. We are now looking at using the blockchain (and implicitly bitcoin) in ways that achieve a similar vision but are not nearly so straightforward as “Send x bitcoins from User A to User B”.  The potential increases for alternative chains to take up space in large mining centers. Private Custom Blockchain hosting is right around the corner.  I have a rule of thumb when it comes to new businesses: any good business takes 10 years to develop, and transaction processing is well on its way to reaching that milestone.

42398836,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh0Ri,1452249108,Gem Shifts Focus With New Emphasis on Blockchain,"Following what data indicates was one of the weakest funding quarters on record for the industry, blockchain API provider Gem kickstarted 2016 with a $7.1m Series A announced this week.  Founded in 2014, Gem raised $2m in seed funding for a bitcoin API product aimed at industry developers. However, the most recent announcement finds Gem advertising its service as an agnostic 'blockchain API', a move that puts it in line with industry firms such as ChangeTip and Uphold that have sought to diversify their offerings away from digital currencies in recent months.  In conversation, Gem CEO Micah Winkelspecht acknowledged that the funding round comes at a time when the two-year-old company’s business strategy is changing.  Gem’s product, he said, has become less ""bitcoin-focused"" as the company has sought to tap into a growing new market for blockchain project development expertise at enterprise financials.  Winkelspecht compared his company's new model to competing competing blockchain API provider Chain, which raised a $30m Series A in September after pivoting away from bitcoin.  Winkelspecht told CoinDesk:  ""I'm still a huge believer in bitcoin as a currency, but our focus is on enterprise use cases and exploring those with those types of companies. That’s where our focus is.""  The CEO went on to suggest the startup has ""always realized"" its product would need to integrate with different blockchains, citing Gem’s integrations with the litecoin and dogecoin blockchains.  In total, Gem has raised $10.4m to date as part of three public rounds.  The latest round of funding notably saw participation from participants in Chain’s September funding round, including the Digital Currency Group and RRE Ventures.  Changing customer base  While Chain has cut its bitcoin API service, Winkelspecht indicated that Gem has no plans to stop supporting bitcoin-focused partners like Bitwage and Purse.  Winkelspecht framed the shifting emphasis as a prudent one given that, in his view, users from the bitcoin industry don’t need to be educated on its products or the technology on which it is based.  This, he suggested, is a sharp contrast from new customers, who require more time to learn how the tech can meet their needs.  “Our goal is not to be a consulting company,"" he said. ""Why we do consulting is our customers need help. Before they’re building out a solution and they’re putting their engineers on it, there’s a huge amount of time on that.”  Following the funding, Gem said it will seek to add new employees that can complement its existing engineering personnel, which means adding business support.  Evolving thesis  Core to Gem’s strategy going forward, Winkelspecht said, is a belief that the bitcoin blockchain does not meet the needs of enterprise clients due to its inability to satisfy certain use cases.  Winkelspecht worded his remarks carefully, but indicated that while he sees bitcoin’s proof-of-work mining network and open consensus algorithm as essential components of a decentralized global currency, they might limit the technology's wider adoption.  ""Quite frankly, financial institutions don’t have the need for a censorship-resistant blockchain. They do have a need for speed, and custom assets that they can represent,"" he said.  Still, he noted that, in his view, participants in the industry are ""talking past each other"", and that he believes the future will be one where there are many available blockchains.  “Some will be more focused on solving smart contracts and automation, and some will be geared toward financial transactions, and some are going to be geared toward data management,” he added, concluding:  ""There will be both public and private chains and both will be successful.""
