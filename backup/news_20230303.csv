""Unfortunately, we have no additional information to share at this time,"" the spokesperson said.  SEN is a 24/7 instant settlement service the bank's clients could use to conduct transactions between each other at any time, including nights and weekends. The bank counted a number of major crypto firms as its clients for the service, including Binance.US, Kraken, Gemini and ErisX (prior to its acquisition by Cboe).  Silvergate has had a rough week after disclosing on Wednesday that it would delay the filing of its annual report due to questions from its auditors. In the same notice, the bank admitted it was facing investigations from bank regulators and the U.S. Department of Justice, and said its ability to be a ""going concern"" over the next year may be in doubt.

Speaking at a bankruptcy hearing to determine if Voyager should be sold to Binance.US, SEC senior trial attorney William Uptegrove said he was responding to Judge Michael Wiles, of the Southern District Bankruptcy Court in New York, who said at the outset of the hearing that the SEC had provided little guidance or specifics about its objection to the Voyager sale.  ""The staff believes – based solely on the facts and circumstances currently known to the staff – that the offering and sale of VGX tokens has the attributes of a securities transaction,"" he said. ""The staff also believes that Binance.US is operating an unregistered securities exchange in the United States.""  The official noted that SEC staff's views don't necessarily reflect the views of the five commissioners at the head of the agency. He did not say whether the SEC had any enforcement actions in the works tied to his declaration.  ""The commission has not made any determinations on either of these issues,"" he said. ""The staff beliefs do not represent the [view] of the commission.""  Typically, an enforcement action by the SEC is started by the staff, but needs a majority of commissioners to vote in favor to proceed.  ""It is regrettable that an SEC staff member would make allegations, that Binance.US and platforms like ours are operating an unregistered exchange, without specifying the assets listed on our exchange that the SEC considers to be securities,"" a Binance.US spokesperson said. ""We, along with others in our industry, remain committed to constructive dialogue with regulators and supporting a comprehensive regulatory framework drafted and passed by Congress to ensure innovation continues in the United States.""  Uptegrove's comments echo SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has said in the past that he believes a majority of crypto trading platforms should be registered as national securities exchanges, which would see them operate under the agency's disclosure and compliance regime.  Voyager plans to sell its assets to Binance.US as part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring plan.

The long-term issuer rating for its bank subsidiary Silvergate Bank also dropped to Ca from B3, while its long-term deposit rating was cut to C from Caa3. The bank's baseline credit assessment was reduced to caa3 from b2. In addition, the ratings may be cut further.

In addition, Silvergate ( SI ) realized additional investment losses, which had previously been recorded as other-than-temporary impairment of securities, when it sold some additional investment securities to fully repay its outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank advances.

42410835,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggru8A,1677880961,The Rise and Fall of Silvergate’s Crypto Business,"Silvergate Bank lost more than $8 billion in deposits from its crypto customers in the final months of 2022 as its core block of business crumbled under the industry’s implosion – just as the bank’s regulators had predicted might happen for such institutions.  The sudden evaporation of most of its deposit base was only one of several worries for the La Jolla, California-based lender. The company has faced pressures from U.S. banking watchdogs that have been insisting that banks shouldn’t concentrate on crypto, and its disclosures this week revealed investigations from regulators and the U.S. Department of Justice, plus a suggestion that ongoing audits may require a restating of its financials.  Apart from all that, its one-time crypto strengths were starting to drag it down, according to a CoinDesk analysis of the bank’s financial reports over the past several years.  Many of the raw numbers reported by Silvergate over the years reveal an institution that may have peaked in 2021, well before the dramas of 2022 shook the crypto sector. The volume on its Silvergate Exchange Network, for instance, hit a high in the first half of 2021, with $406 billion in transfers, which slid to $230 billion by the second half of 2022.  And the bank's overall asset size also reached a high point in the fourth quarter of 2021, at $16 billion. Its most recent report showed it at $11.4 billion.  Even the high point of its assets describe a very small bank – the scale of a mid-range community bank – despite its outsized reputation as a core part of the digital assets industry’s U.S. banking presence. A near equivalent for its size in California would be the slightly larger Farmers and Merchants Bank of Long Beach, according to state banking data.  But one key difference between Silvergate and the more traditional Long Beach community bank is in the key measure of their capital. The crypto bank slid rapidly into the final quarter of 2022 to a so-called leverage ratio that revealed it maintained just 5.4% of capital against its overall assets. In the same quarter at the latter bank, it reported a ratio of 10.9%.  According to U.S. bank capital rules, 5% is the edge of the cliff, beyond which a bank descends below a ""well-capitalized"" designation and toward the territory of emergency intervention from regulators.  A spokesman representing the bank said, “Silvergate can’t comment beyond what’s already been made publicly available.”  One of the most dramatic descents to track in Silvergate’s publicly released data was its deposits problem.  Silvergate identified the number of digital-assets customers it was working with each quarter, and that crowd steadily rose to 1,620 last quarter – most of those identified as institutional investors, though more than 100 were ""digital asset exchanges."" However, those crypto customers' deposits plummeted from almost $12 billion in the third quarter last year to less than $4 billion by the end of the year.  The amount has clearly dropped much more than that now, as several big names in its customer base are severing ties. Coinbase, Paxos, Circle Internet Financial and Galaxy Digital have been among those making very public comments distancing themselves from the struggling bank.  A traditional, regulated depository institution can’t make it without a deposit base, and Silvergate’s coffers were drawn down quickly as major crypto clients dealt with their own collapses, bankruptcies and legal disputes that required an instant vacuuming of their liquid cash last year.  Still, for crypto businesses, the options for U.S. banking are getting narrower as the Federal Reserve and other banking agencies warn that they don’t want the lenders they oversee getting overly exposed to the digital assets sector. Only a few banks had been as openly and unapologetically crypto-focused as Silvergate, so its struggles aren’t offering a shining path for other institutions to follow.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/03/the-rise-and-fall-of-silvergates-crypto-business,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/575d0212757c1749ed6f2a0e205075e9632a030d-1980x1082.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42435403,yQOv5bn58BVfxFU7cHP2Nk,1677879647,Dan Harmon's Still-Unreleased NFT TV Show 'Krapopolis' Gets Third Season,"“Krapopolis,” the animated TV series from “Rick and Morty” co-creator Dan Harmon, has been renewed for a third season without airing a single episode.  The show, set in mythical ancient Greece, is set to premiere on Fox sometime in 2023. It will be voiced by an all-star cast, including Hannah Waddingham, Richard Ayoade, Matt Berry, Pam Murphy and Duncan Trussell.  Krapopolis launched its inaugural 10,420 Krap Chicken non-fungible token collection in August, which allows holders to vote on show elements, access behind-the-scenes content, attend IRL experiences with the cast and crew and redeem rewards for official merch and digital goods.  Currently, Krap Chickens can still be minted on the Krapopolis site for 0.18 ether (ETH), or about $280, while the floor price of the collection on OpenSea sits at around 0.11 ETH (about $170). The floor price being lower than the cost to mint an NFT in a collection is generally viewed as a bad sign, as recently seen with Porsche's ill-received NFT collection.  Still, Michael Thorn ,Fox's president of scripted programming, told Deadline on Thursday that he remained ""bullish"" on supporting projects with promise. “While [a third season order] is atypical,it was a no-brainer for us with 'Krapopolis.'”  In July, it was announced that Fox Entertainment would be investing $100 million into the project.

42394483,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw8Kzb,1677878041,What Is a 'Fair Launch' in Crypto?,"Despite the professed egalitarianism of cryptocurrency, new token distributions can skew in favor of private investors, the founders of the token or those who have been tipped off about a new crypto investment before launch.  Check token distributions of popular coins and you may be shocked to learn that huge swathes of so-called decentralized networks are reserved for early investors or founders, leaving the general public as second-class investors.  See Also: What Is Tokenomics and Why Is It Important?  The promise of a “fair launch” remedies these inequalities. The concept refers to projects that provide everyone with an equal chance of acquiring tokens, no matter their status, meaning that no party is privileged to an investment above any other.  Fair launches gained popularity among those who think the market is rigged against them, jaded by whitelists, venture capital allocations and pre-mines that skew favor to the few in the know over the general population.  Crypto intelligence platform Messari lists the most popular fair launch tokens, which include bitcoin (BTC), monero (XMR) and sushi (SUSHI).  Fair launches explained  A fair launch takes place in a decentralized crypto network where tokens are earned, owned and governed by the community from the outset. It should make sure anyone is able to participate. A fair launch ensures there is no early access, pre-mine or allocation of tokens.  Still, what constitutes “fair”? A useful framework proposed by crypto researcher Hasu and Paradigm investment partner Arjun Balaji in 2019 described fairness as something that offers equal opportunity to acquire coins over a long period of time. They contended that a launch is fairer “the more potential buyers are aware that a project exists.” If the entire supply is sold within a month, they ask, “did the market really have a chance for proper price discovery?”  Hasu and Balaji also champion relative price equality – that “no group or person that can acquire the token at a sizable discount to the market price.” Interestingly, they don’t disavow early token access entirely, claiming that certain discounts are justified if funds are locked up under certain conditions such as a long lockup time, the rationale being that early investors should be rewarded for accepting risk.  Like with most things in crypto, it’s not always helpful to assess a launch in terms of a binary “fair/unfair.” Some launches are more fair than others; given the myriad token distribution mechanisms that projects can choose from, fairness can be difficult to judge without the benefit of hindsight.  Why do fair launches matter?  Fair launches allow everyone to get in on the ground level. They solve the problems that have led to unfair launches that occur when founders give in to pressure to get investors on board by promising them cheaper tokens, earlier than anyone else.  Crypto projects are often pressured into following what is a default method of conventional tech funding, where an early stage project shops around for venture capitalists or angel investors who can access and get equity in a private company years before it goes public.  The drawback for crypto is that when these VCs can cash out of a crypto project they may do so quickly and in a way that benefits only these early investors who bought in cheaply. When the VCs dump their tokens, public investors may find prices plummet as massive quantities hit the market at once, leaving later-stage investors with tokens that have lost most of their value.  What does a fair launch look like?  These days, decentralized finance (DeFi) projects generally make people work for their tokens. This happens in two main ways:  The first is to retrospectively reward people for being early users of a protocol through an airdrop. This is what OpenDAO did in late 2021. The project wanted to become a kind of decentralized insurance fund for non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea. Anyone could mint its token, SOS, based on their prior engagement with the NFT marketplace.  The launch could be considered fair as nobody (save for the creators of the protocol) could game this engagement before the minting went live. However, fair launches do not necessarily translate into successful projects. OpenDAO, while it had a fair launch, did not set out clear goals and a long-term road map, and security risks were also flagged with the project. Shortly after launch, the SOS token plummeted in price and has since flatlined.  The second is to reward users for continued contributions to projects. This is what projects like Yearn.Finance (YFI) did. Yearn’s creator, Andre Cronje, reserved no YFI tokens for himself, instead letting those that provided liquidity to the platform earn tokens.  Read More: What Is Yearn? A Guide to the Gateway of Decentralized Finance  Bitcoin is a similar example of a fair launch. Bitcoin miners earn new bitcoin for contributing their computational power to the network. Its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, didn’t reserve coins before launch.

The company has also been able to take advantage of discounted mining equipment to add more computing power. For Bitcoin bulls, CLSK is an interesting speculative bet. CleanSpark ( CLSK ) is an interesting play on a rebound in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices that should benefit from discounted mining equipment and lower energy costs. Investors can consider a starter position but may be better off waiting until after the company does a secondary offering before getting more aggressive. Company Profile CLSK is a Bitcoin miner. In fact, the only cryptocurrency it mines is Bitcoin. Before being in the Bitcoin mining space, it provided energy technology solutions to commercial and residential customers. However, it discontinued that business in 2022. The company entered the Bitcoin mining space through its acquisition of ATL in December 2020. It then acquired an additional data center, picking up a second one in August 2021, a third data center and mining equipment in August 2022, and a fourth data center and mining equipment in October 2022. It also has a co-location agreement with Coinmint. The company owns and operates its facilities and does not lease mining space to other mining companies or private individuals. Its primary site sits on 16.35 acres located in Sandersville, Washington County, Georgia. Coinmint's facility in New York also hosts some of its miners. Company Presentation CLSK will sell the Bitcoin it mines from time to time to support its operations and to fund strategic growth. It does not participate in regular Bitcoin trading, nor does it hedge its Bitcoin holdings. The company says it does not use a specific formula or program to sell its Bitcoin and instead relies on management analyzing forecasts and monitoring the market in real-time. Opportunities As a holder of Bitcoin, one of the biggest positives for CLSK would be a rebound in the price of Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has nosedived from its 2021 highs of over $67,000 to fall to under $16,000. The price of Bitcoin has since rallied to over $23,000. Any return to Bitcoin's highs would be a big driver for CLSK's stock. Yahoo Finance For Bitcoin miners, one of the most important metrics is its hashrate. The company describes this as ""a measure of the computing and processing power and speed by which a mining computer mines and processes transactions on the Bitcoin network."" In crypto mining, a blockchain network generates an alphanumeric code called a hash that mining computers must guess. The hashrate measures the number of guesses a miner's computer makes per second to solve for the hash. The more guesses per second, the more likely a miner is to guess the hash and receive, in this case, a Bitcoin. In simpler terms, the hashrate is how quickly a set of computers can guess a random code to receive a Bitcoin. The more computing power a miner has, the more guesses per second it can generate and thus the more Bitcoin it can earn through this process. The more Bitcoins that are mined, though, the more difficult the codes become and more computing power is needed to maintain the same hashrate. CSLK has done a really good job of increasing its hashrate and saw a nice intra-quarter jump in Q4. On its Q4 earnings call, CEO Zachary Bradford said: ""We had 63,700 machine hashing as of December 31. Our fleet was running at an average efficiency of about 31 watts per terahash. For perspective, we understand some of our peers come in at over 40 watts per terahash. Our fleet is tremendously efficient. Most of our machines come from BITMAIN's S19 series, and we have started to acquire more XPs. The quality of the machine tells only part of the story. Our immersion cool facility has allowed us to test the limits of over and under clocking as we leverage software and firmware to optimize performance. We are also testing additional software optimization techniques for our air cooled fleet, which we expect to allow us to bring under and overclocking capabilities to all of our campuses. This optimization will prepare us to stay ahead of the curve when halving occurs in 2024."" Company Presentation CLSK also has an opportunity to continue to take advantage of a distressed market for mining equipment . While some miners have had to unload mining equipment for cash, earlier this month CLSK was able to purchase 20,000 brand new Antminer S19j Pro+ ((PLUS)) units at a 25% discount from the manufacturer. The new machines are expected to add 2.44 EH/s to the company's existing 6.6 EH/s of Bitcoin mining computing power, bringing it up to 9 EH/s. The company credits using a proprietary mining model as an advantage, allowing it flexibility and the ability to control its own infrastructure and resources. On its earnings call, Bradford said: ""The secret to our growth has been our proprietary mining model. There are many different mining models out there, from asset-light on one side through proprietary mining on the other. In the asset-light model, machines are owned by the company, but cared for and run by hosting companies that also take a cut of the profits. This model introduces less control over a company's destiny via the company is exposed to the risks and uncertainties of third parties, their ability to build facilities, procure power, operate the machinery and importantly, stay solvent. We believe higher returns are consistently generated by actively participating in the mining process. Contrast that with proprietary mining, miners like CleanSpark that operate almost exclusively as proprietary miners can exercise significant greater control over their own destinies. We believe this gives us a significant edge."" Lower energy prices are another really big positive. Natural gas prices have nosedived, which should help lower overall energy costs and be good for CLSK and other miners . Energy prices weighed on CLSK in FY23, and it sounds from what management said on its Q4 earnings call that the company might look to lock in long-term energy prices now that the market has turned decidedly lower. As you can see from the chart, nat gas prices soared in 2022, but have plunged so far in 2023. Most electricity in the U.S. is generated from natural gas. EIA Risks The biggest risk to CLSK is not surprisingly the price of Bitcoin. While the pros and cons of Bitcoin and where it eventually trade can be argued, the one thing that is undeniable is that the cryptocurrency's price is volatile. Thus, not surprisingly, the stock prices of crypto miners, including CLSK, can also be quite volatile as well. While CLSK has done a good job increasing its hashrate, it also lowered its 2023 year-end projections from 22.4 EH/s to 16 EH/s. One of the big reasons is that the company had a partnership with Lancium where it would add 6.6 EH/s of capacity this year. However, the company said on its Q4 call and in its earnings release that the project is looking doubtful and at the very least has been pushed back into next year. Fortunately, the company has said it has no capital currently tied up in the project. The company also carries some debt and just bought $32.3 million in new equipment, which will add to its leverage, at least temporarily. It expects to spend between $210-280 million in CapEx this year. To pay for that, the company on its Q4 call said that it plans to issue shares, which will dilute shareholders. Bradford said the company plans to ask for the authorization to offer between 100-300 million shares at its next annual meeting. With its stock well off its highs, that might not be the best move. Conclusion If you're a Bitcoin bull, I think CLSK is an interesting play. The miner should greatly benefit from lower energy costs and depressed mining equipment costs. Its balance sheet is in pretty good shape, but the company is going to massively dilute shareholders as it looks to continue to grow and scale. Simple math says that at CapEx of $250 million and the stock trading at around $2.50, it would have to issue 100 million shares if it wanted to pay for all its CapEx via a share offering. The company currently has only 78 million shares outstanding. That said, its increase in share count should be at a bit less (2.3x) than the 2.4x increase in its 2023 year-end hashrate. Throw in much-reduced energy prices and a potential rebound in Bitcoin prices, and the move to raise capital to increase its hashrate makes sense. The lower amount it has to spend on CapEx to reach its projected year-end 2023 hashrate or the higher its share price (less dilution), the better for the company. I think speculative investors can look to take a starter position, but I'd wait until after the company issues equity to get more aggressive.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4584418-cleanspark-lower-energy-costs-potential-tailwind?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10229715.jpeg

Cash App Savings offers lucrative insights into users’ spending intentions, which can feed into targeted advertising solutions in the future. The presence of consumer savings within the Cash App is conducive to users purchasing products/ services using Cash App Pay / Cash Card, generating interchange fee revenue for Block. Cash App Savings does not pay interest, which could impede growth given the highly competitive nature of the industry, and the high-inflationary environment. The Cash App is merely playing catch up to competitors in the space; it does not have a first-mover advantage here. Block's new strategy is promising, but not competitive Block's (SQ) Cash App continues to evolve as its suite of financial services expand. From trading Bitcoin (BTC-USD) to filing taxes, the company is striving hard to deeply imbed the Cash App into consumers' financial lives. A key growth strategy the fintech giant is using is expanding into core banking services, and cross-selling its features to induce deeper integration. Its latest advancement is the Cash App Savings feature, striving to increase direct deposits into the app, and taking a step closer towards its e-commerce ambitions. Block is well-positioned to capitalize on the secular growth trends of the fintech industry, though the company will need to step up the competitiveness of its offerings to more aggressively penetrate the market. Nexus Research has a ""hold"" rating to Block. In January 2023, Block introduced Cash App Savings. Cash App's new savings feature is automatically present in the 'Money' tab of the app, without consumers needing to create a new account. The seamless savings experience can induce users to increasingly perceive Cash App as a place for storing wealth. The primary intention behind Cash App Savings is to attract more direct deposits, and more deeply imbed the Cash App into consumers' financial lives. cash.app An important point to note right off the bat is that Cash App Savings currently does not pay any interest. The inability to earn interest undermines the appeal of the feature, given the highly competitive landscape of the financial services industry to attract depositors, and the current high-inflationary environment making interest-paying financial products/ services even more essential. Given Block's long-term banking ambitions for the Cash App, there is indeed a good possibility the company could start paying interest on savings in the future as competition intensifies for depositors' money. Block has not disclosed the level of direct deposit inflows since the launch of the Savings feature. However, on the Q4 2022 earnings call , CFO & COO Amrita Ahuja proclaimed: We continue to build out our banking offering by introducing savings, which has been one of our fastest-growing products on Cash App. While ""fastest-growing"" sounds alluring, the executives did not offer details on how it is perceived to be one of their ""fastest-growing products"". Over the next few quarters, investors will observe whether it has meaningfully encouraged more users to deposit more money into their Cash App accounts from other stores of wealth. Nonetheless, the Cash App's growing suite of banking facilities should be conducive to more direct deposit inflows over time. In fact, Block is already cross-selling its other banking products through Cash App Savings, namely the Cash Card. It enables Cash Card users to turn on 'Round Ups' in the Cash App, whereby extra change from purchases flows directly into their savings. Greater use of the Cash Card generates more revenue from interchange fees. cash.app More money stored in the Cash App in the form of savings offers more capital to facilitate Block's lending activities, such as through Cash App Borrow, its Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) service AfterPay, or Square loans to businesses. Greater ability to lend out more funds can subsequently generate more interest income for the company. Cash App Savings also brings it a step closer to its e-commerce ambitions, conducive to advertising revenue. Cash App ecommerce On the Q3 2022 earnings call , CEO Jack Dorsey shared that the company is ""still early in [its] journey to transform Cash App into a commerce destination that bridges [their] seller and consumer ecosystems"". E-commerce platforms inherently offer great advertising opportunities, just look at Amazon's flourishing advertising business . While Block executives have not explicitly stated any digital advertising endeavors, it can be presumed to be the next logical step given the evolution of other e-commerce platforms. Last year, the tech giant introduced the Discover tab within the Cash App, where users can explore brands and their products, and look for special deals/ discounts. The Discover tab also includes a search engine allowing users to search for specific products that they are after, enabling Block to grasp consumer intent, conducive to effective ad solutions in the future. Furthermore, a lucrative feature of Cash App Savings is that users can define the purpose of their savings, such as travelling, birthday gifts, or a new phone. This offers lucrative insights into users' spending intentions, which can feed into targeted advertising solutions in the future. Block could indeed show ads relevant to users' saving purposes in the Discover tab of the Cash App, conducive to effective conversion rates for merchants given that users have already expressed interest in their products/ services. Offering high-converting ad solutions can indeed create an attractive advertising revenue stream going forward. cash.app Even if users don't end up purchasing the advertised products/ services, the presence of their savings within the Cash App is conducive to users purchasing the desired product/ service using Cash App Pay / Cash Card, generating interchange fee revenue for the tech giant (subject to the merchant accepting the payment method). Counteractive factors Absence of interest payments on savings While the introduction of Cash App Savings is a step in the right direction to induce more direct deposit inflows, the fact that it is not interest-bearing can be a serious impediment to its growth potential. CEO Jack Dorsey has been adamant about improving financial literacy across marginalized communities, which makes it ironic that his company is encouraging consumers to deposit money into a savings feature that doesn't pay any interest while facing a high-inflationary environment. The fintech industry is a highly-competitive space, with companies striving hard to attract depositors away from traditional banks. For context, top competitor PayPal had also launched an in-app savings account in September 2021, currently offering an interest rate of 3.75% APY, proclaiming it to be 12x the US national average. If the Cash App truly wants to become a force to be reckoned with in the digital banking industry, it will need to start offering competitive interest rates on savings features, to meaningfully increase direct deposits into the app. Innovation not bold enough Digital savings accounts, round-ups and purpose-driven savings are nothing new in the fintech world. The Cash App is merely playing catch up to competitors in the space. It does not have a first-mover advantage for any of these features. Competitors' customers that are already well-versed into their apps through similar features are unlikely to migrate to the Cash App amid the launch of this Savings component. Therefore, Cash App Savings is more likely to act as a customer retention strategy, as opposed to an aggressive customer acquisition strategy. While first-mover advantages can be effective at acquiring market share, it does not necessarily mean that players like Cash App can't capture market share from competitors. Though in order to seriously challenge competitors, Block will need to get bolder with its innovations and strategies. A unique edge that the company holds over its competitors is that it runs two ecosystems simultaneously, accessing both sides of commerce equation. Specifically, Block overlooks a large community of merchants through the Square ecosystem, and an alluring base of consumers through the Cash App ecosystem. Additionally, Block could leverage the power of AfterPay, the BNPL company it acquired in 2021, to foster a connection between the two ecosystems and augment the commerce experience for both consumers and sellers, to really build a competitive moat around its platform. Dorsey touched upon the potential of such integrations on the last earnings call : In terms of the ecosystem integrations, the number one, we're focused on, obviously, is AfterPay is the connection between Square and Cash App. We're still early in the product integration, but the place to look is obviously going to be in Cash App in the Discover Tab in marketplace. We believe that we started -- we're pretty early in just what this area will do. Right now, it looks like a fairly simple search. And I think the UI [User Interface] is a little bit off. But we're going to continue to iterate as quickly as possible to make sure that we meet the opportunity, which is pretty massive for us. While the company seems to be moving in the right direction, it will need to step up its game in order to aggressively penetrate the mobile payments/ banking industry, by offering more distinctive services in a timely manner. Overall thesis In 2022, Cash App ecosystem contributed 61% to total revenue, though it is important to note that 67% of Cash App revenue derived from the Bitcoin feature. Nonetheless, transaction-based revenue and subscription/ services-based revenue are becoming larger components of Cash App revenue year-over-year, as Block continues to establish the banking features of the Cash App. The growing suite of banking services, and deeply integrated cross-selling opportunities, offers continued revenue growth potential. Moreover, Cash App's move towards e-commerce is conducive to lucrative advertising revenue, further augmenting revenue growth prospects. Block shares are currently trading at a Price to Sales (P/S) multiple of around 2.5x, marking a significant contraction from around 15.5x in December 2020, as the stock market downtrend over the past 16 months has particularly punished tech growth stocks. The P/S ratio incorporates investor sentiment towards all of Block's revenue segments collectively, such as Square ecosystem and TIDAL ecosystem. Nevertheless, the market may be under-appreciating the Cash App's revenue growth potential, particularly through advertising solutions going forward as it transforms into an e-commerce destination, which could make the current P/S multiple an attractive entry point. Though investors should note that the poor performance of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will have also contributed to the stock's multiple compression, given that Bitcoin trading constitutes a large portion of the company's Cash App revenue, which could continue to weigh on the stock, depending on how cryptocurrencies perform going forward. Furthermore, investors should also note that Block became a loss-making company again in 2022, delivering a loss of over $540 million for the period. On the latest earnings call, the executives outlined their investment framework, committing to invest in growth opportunities in a cost-effective and disciplined manner going forward, to improve profitability. Block currently trades at a forward P/E multiple (non-GAAP) of almost 45x, while the 5-year average is almost 144x. The stock also trades at a premium relative to the sector, which has a median forward P/E multiple (non-GAAP) of 20x. Hence, the stock remains relatively expensive on a forward P/E basis. On the Q4 2022 earnings call, CFO Amrita Ahuja shared: We expect Cash App margins to expand, which is a continuation really of some years now of improving profitability for the Cash App business. We expect Square margins to be more consistent year-over-year, partly due to some of the moderation of growth related to macro impact Furthermore, as the Cash App transforms into an e-commerce destination, the ability to sell advertising solutions in the future should also augment profit margins. However, intensifying competition could pressure margin expansion going forward. As mentioned earlier, the fintech giant will likely have to start offering competitive interest rates on its Cash App Savings feature going forward, in order to continue retaining and acquiring customers, which would indeed compress profit margins. Overall, Block continues to be well-positioned to capitalize on the secular growth trends amid commerce evolvements, both through its Cash and Square ecosystems. Though as mentioned earlier, the company will need to step up its innovation and market penetration strategies to effectively capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead. Intensifying competition may also pressure profitability going forward. Even though the stock has a seen a considerable contraction in the forward P/E perspective, the stock remains expensive. On a broader macro note, tech growth stocks like Block had witnessed significant upside during the era of ultra-loose monetary policy conditions. As the Fed shifts from Quantitative Easing to an unprecedented period of Quantitative Tightening to fight inflation, tech growth stocks could continue to face pressure. Nexus Research assigns a ""hold"" rating to Block.

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Tether used bank accounts in the names of executives of various companies, slightly tweaking those companies' names, to maintain its access to the global financial system in 2018.  The report pointed to Crypto Capital Corp., a ""shadow bank"" which held Tether funds before being shut down by authorities in 2018, and others, alleging sister company Bitfinex and Tether ""were able to open at least nine new bank accounts for shell companies in Asia"" in October 2018.  Tether spokespeople did not immediately return requests for comment.  Paolo Ardoino, the chief technology officer of Tether, tweeted on Friday afternoon that the WSJ report contained a ""ton of misinformation and inaccuracies,"" without giving specifics.  According to the Journal's report, Tether Holdings co-owner Stephen Moore pushed back against the use of fake sales invoices, saying, ""I would not want to argue any of the above in a potential fraud/money laundering case"" in an email seen by the Journal, referring to an intermediary that traded USDT in China.  The report also referenced the recording of a call with former Tether executive Phil Potter posted to YouTube in 2017 by Bitfinexed.  ""We've had banking hiccups in the past, we've just – we've always been able to route around it or deal with it, open up new accounts or what have you,"" Potter said. ""There’s been lots of sort of cat-and-mouse tricks that everyone in the bitcoin industry has to avail themselves of.""  Crypto companies have traditionally had difficulties securing banking access. Tether in particular has had a number of bank accounts over the past few years, with some banks shutting down the stablecoin issuer's accounts.  The Journal report came the day after crypto-friendly bank Silvergate came under intense scrutiny for announcing it had to restate financials and would not meet a deadline to file its annual report. Major clients have suspended their ties with Silvergate, and its stock price cratered.  In recent months, federal regulators have been warning banks that their relationships with crypto may invite risk.

42435404,yQOv5bn58BVfxFU7cHP2SG,1677873117,"Gitcoin, a Crowdfunding Platform for Open-Source Software Votes to Seed Staked ETH Index","Community members of Gitcoin, an organization set up to fund open-source software and other “digital public goods” such as blockchain code, voted to seed initial liquidity for its Staked ETH Index (gtcETH).  The vote comes amid growing interest in liquid staking as the Ethereum blockchain moves toward the much-heralded “Shanghai” hard fork that will allow investors to withdraw staked ether for the first time.  One benefit for Gitcoin could be that if there were adoption of gtcETH, the new effort could raise fees that could help to fund the organization’s grants program.  On Friday, Gitcoin community members passed a governance proposal with almost unanimous support to formalize a relationship with the index provider Index Cooperative, and transfer 100 ether (ETH) worth $164,600 into two liquidity pools meant to “ensure deeper liquidity and reduce swapping fees for moving into gtcETH,” according to a snapshot.  The creators claim the Gitcoin Staked ETH Index is the first on-chain offering where holders can simultaneously support funding of digital public goods and earn rewards from a diverse set of liquid staking tokens.  Includes Lido, RocketPool and StakeWise  GtcETH, built on Index Coop’s EVM-based protocol that enables asset-management strategies, is composed of three tokens from top liquid staking protocols on Ethereum: Lido, Rocket Pool and StakeWise. These three liquid staking protocols were chosen based on several factors including having a minimum of $25 million secondary market liquidity on Ethereum’s mainnet and being open source.  Gitcoin’s gtcETH vote comes as the project moves toward exclusively running the grants program on “Grant Stacks” – described on its website as the “first-ever decentralized, customizable, smart contract-enabled solution that connects grants program managers, project owners and community members.” The decision was announced in January. The system will rely on Allo Protocol.  One of the motivations behind gtcETH stems from the unpredictability related to raising funds for digital public goods – think digital infrastructure, like open-source code, a blockchain or an open data set that could be consumed by everybody. Without a clear profit motive, the funding is sometimes hard to come by.  According to the governance forum discussion on funding gtcETH, GtcETH could provide Gitcoin a consistent revenue stream to help fund grants.  Here's how that's supposed to work: Token holders of gtcETH incur an annualized streaming fee of 2%, where 1.75% is allocated to the Gitcoin decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and the remaining amount to Index Coop.  If gtcETH had a total value locked (TVL) of $1 million, gtcETH would contribute roughly $17,500 a year to Gitcoin Grants, placing the index in the top ten in Gitcoin’s Funders Leaderboard, according to Index Coop’s snapshot vote to launch gtcETH.  GTC is Gitcoin’s native token that governs both Gitcoin Grants and GitcoinDAO. Despite Gitcoin support documents indicating that the governance token has “no economic value,” GTC has a market capitalization of $125 million.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Sage D.

This is the first time BUSD’s circulating supply has gone below $10 billion since June 2021.  Demand for BUSD has been rapidly declining since Paxos announced on Feb. 13 it would stop minting new BUSD tokens, citing orders from state regulator New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Separately, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was reportedly preparing to sue Paxos for offering unregistered securities.  Blockchain data by crypto intelligence firm Nansen shows that investors have redeemed some $6.7 billion of BUSD from Paxos since Feb. 13.  As a result of the falling demand, dogecoin (DOGE) replaced BUSD as the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap.  Read more: Binance USD's $16B Market Cap Up for Grabs as Paxos Regulatory Action Stirs Up Stablecoin Rivalry  BUSD liquidity concerns  U.S.-based crypto exchange giant Coinbase announced this week that it will pause trading of BUSD on the platform starting March 13. Coinbase Chief Executive Brian Armstrong cited liquidity concerns for delisting the stablecoin.  “Coinbase's decision to delist was likely made as a precaution in anticipation of a future drop in liquidity or operational concerns around redemptions,” Clara Medalie, director of research at crypto market research firm Kaiko, told CoinDesk.  The daily trading volume for BUSD on Coinbase was only about $9 million in the last two months, while the market depth within 2% of the market price was just $600,000, according to data from Kaiko, making the stablecoin’s price vulnerable to wobbles. Market depth represents the open buy and sell orders for an asset within a certain price range; the deeper the market, the more stable the price is.  BUSD liquidity on Binance, the stablecoin’s main market, significantly deteriorated last month.  Kaiko data shows that market depth within 2% for BUSD-USDT and BUSD-DAI stablecoin pairs has fallen to $123 million from $200 million in February before the Paxos announcement.  “The overall liquidity is very thin,” Medalie said, “which is not great for a stablecoin that should theoretically always trade 1:1” with the U.S. dollar.

42411189,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLs6S,1677871232,Has Tokenization’s Moment Finally Come?,"Mentioning “tokenization of real-world assets” to some of my longer-serving colleagues at CoinDesk can elicit eye rolls – they’ve heard it all before.  But at the risk of falling into the “this time is different” optimism trap, I would say the current buzz around “RWA” feels more real and impactful than the 2018 chatter about “security tokens” and “tokenized securities” (which, as Noelle Acheson reminded us recently, are not the same thing.)  The idea that blockchain technology and native tokens can represent off-chain assets – financial securities such as stocks and bonds, or commercial rights such as trade receivables and fractionalized real estate or art – has been around for a while. The concept tends to find favor around market crash moments, when a public backlash arises against native crypto tokens like bitcoin and ether – as happened after the bursting of the initial coin offering bubble in 2018 and, now, in the post-FTX era. At such times, a mindset emerges that it’s more palatable to the mainstream to convert familiar, relatively stable, pre-regulated assets into blockchain-based digital assets than to bet on pure crypto.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Blockchain purists often reject this model in both good and bad times, pointing out that it breaks the “trustless” structure of decentralized blockchains because someone or some centralized institution must now be trusted to identify, represent and attest to the value of the assets on chain. Also, many were dismissive of the underlying models used in early tokenization projects, which were built on permissioned blockchains run by consortia of banks or other companies, a centralized framework that crypto advocates view as adding no more value than the more efficient, less expensive option of a SQL database.  Time will tell whether the latest wave of tokenization – which has drawn in large Wall Street banks, the Singaporean government and asset managers such as Wisdom Tree and Hamilton Lane – moves this idea beyond the fringe into the mainstream. But there are reasons to believe it has momentum.  One is that technological advances in cryptography since 2018 have encouraged tokenization projects to migrate from those closed, permissioned projects onto public, permissionless blockchain platforms such as Polygon. And that has, in turn, allowed them to tap into the more rapid pace of innovation happening on those chains, including in areas such as zero-knowledge proofs, which enable a balance between the privacy that investors and issuers demand and the advantages of programmability, instant settlement and data transparency.  Another driver behind this advance lies in economic conditions. Inflation and higher interest rates are forcing entities to seek out new markets and trading efficiencies and to free up dormant capital. The pitch behind tokenization is that it achieves all of that.  Mainstreaming  One leader in this field is Pennsylvania-based fund manager Hamilton Lane, which recently partnered with security token provider Securitize to tokenize some of it $2.1 billion flagship Equity Opportunities Fund V. By making smaller portions of the fund available, the firm invited individuals who can’t write giant-sized checks into a portfolio of illiquid but high-return private equity assets typically reserved for institutional investors.  Other big fund managers are eyeing different, democratizing opportunities. Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson, a keynote speaker at CoinDesk’s Consensus event in April, talks about tokenization offering the opportunity to customize individual investors’ portfolios around their interests – including adding exotic new assets such as tokenized royalty streams from their favorite musical artists.  Wisdom Tree, which includes among its offerings exchange-trade products on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, threw its hat in this ring too in December, when it announced nine new, Securities and Exchange Commission-approved blockchain-enabled funds.  The trend is not just seen in consumer-facing deals, either. A clique of big banks, including Citibank, HSBC, BNY Mellon and Wells Fargo, partnered in November with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to tokenize dollars used in wholesale interbank transfers. The intent here is to speed up the clearing and settlement time in the daily netting out of payments across each others’ customer account and to reduce the risk of failed payments.  Regulators missing an opportunity  It’s worth noting, however, that the Fed’s de facto endorsement here is an isolated case among government agencies, one that’s limited to working with a few highly regulated institutions with which it is deeply involved on a daily basis. If anything, governments are the ones that are now swimming against the tide in the tokenization drive.  That, too, is a reaction to the market crash and the FTX debacle. Last month, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) – a multilateral body charged with coordinating regulation to contain systemic risks in international finance – warned that when decentralized finance (DeFi) attempts to “replicate some of the functions of the traditional financial system, [it] inherits and may amplify the vulnerabilities of that system.” The point was read by some to say that tokenization of real-world assets, which would allow those tokens to interface with the hurly-burly DeFi markets of crypto, could introduce the latter’s systemic risks to the entire global economy.  It’s one reason why the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund are all calling for international coordination of the crypto industry.  Read more: Policymakers Need to Focus on Tokenization, Not Just Tokens  It would be a real pity if such a regulatory mission were to kill off tokenization altogether because, if managed properly, putting the world’s stocks, bonds and commercial assets on-chain could well reduce systemic risk, not raise it. A tokenized financial system with traceable, instantly settled transactions would be a more transparent and efficient one, with lower risks of the trade failures that happen when settlement is delayed.  That digital assets are a solution to instability might seem strange to those who wrongfully equate the contagion seen across crypto exchanges and lenders last year as a function of blockchain tech. But the reality is that the fallout from the collapse of FTX, Voyager Digital, Celsius Network et al. stemmed from abuses by centralized entities whose opaque token management practices were possible because they operated off-chain like all other traditional financial institutions. Putting transactions on-chain should, in theory, offset such risks while widening access to investment opportunities.  As former Treasury official John Rizzo argued in a recent opinion piece for CoinDesk, policymakers need to be looking at how tokenization can help foster generational wealth in assets such as real estate by making them available to a wider group. In tokenization, Rizzo wrote, “public officials in Washington [D.C.] have an opportunity to come together and focus on powering a revolution in alternative assets that unlocks the storied American Dream for millions.”  CORRECTION March 6, 00:26 UTC: Corrects to remove reference to an earlier art fund.

10226688,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4584378-ethereum-classic-trust-five-months-after-the-merge?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1677870964,Ethereum Classic Trust: 5 Months After 'The Merge',"Summary Ethereum Classic has seen a massive surge in mean hash rate since Ethereum switched to a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. The level of activity on chain hasn't increased since the merge, and ETC mining profitability has fallen off a cliff since September. Without organic demand for the coin, ETC is likely to struggle from continued sell pressure from miners. ETCG shareholders own 8.5% of the ETC in circulation. ETC remains a highly concentrated crypto by top 100 address ownership. As we've now entered March 2023, we are just under 6 months passed since Ethereum's ( ETH-USD ) merge from proof of work to proof of stake. This was a pretty remarkable technological achievement for the Ethereum developers but it wasn't without some element of controversy from a small subsect of the Ethereum community: the miners. Ethereum Merge Impact To briefly explain for those who didn't follow it closely, Ethereum was one of the few proof-of-work blockchains that could be profitably mined with GPU computers rather than the ASIC machines required by blockchains like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). The impact of moving from PoW to PoS meant many of the Ethereum miners had to quickly find a new way to monetize their GPU machines. This directly impacted public miners like Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ) and HIVE Blockchain ( HIVE ) as they had been using GPUs in their mining fleet. There is some thinking in the crypto community, of which I'm in agreement , that those GPU machines can instead be repurposed for different Web3 activities rather than for transaction processing. Additionally, there was a very small push to develop an entirely new proof-of-work blockchain called Ethereum PoW ( ETHW-USD ). That chain has failed to attract much attention. There has also been some thinking about the viability of Ethereum Classic ( ETC-USD ) as it is also a PoW smart contract chain like Ethereum. Ethereum Classic Activity Speculation that there would be at least some miner migration from Ethereum to Ethereum Classic following the merge turned out to be true. More miners competing for the ETC block reward is usually a good thing for a blockchain from a fundamental perspective if it leads to diversification of the chain's transaction validation. When this happens, it generally means the network is more secure and more difficult for an attacker to exploit. Mean Hash Rate (Coin Metrics) You can see in the chart above, the mean hash rate for Ethereum Classic surged right after Ethereum's merge last September. While a good portion of that hash rate has declined, it is still well above where it was before the merge happened. This is theoretically a good thing for Ethereum Classic's network, but it isn't necessarily a good thing for ETC holders. Transaction Trend (Coin Metrics) This chart shows that there hasn't been much economic activity happening on Ethereum Classic since the merge as ETC transactions have been steadily declining since September. This is not the case for Ethereum, which is flat, or Bitcoin, which has seen an increase in daily transactions going back to September. ETC Profitability (BitInfoCharts) Without additional economic activity happening on the Ethereum Classic blockchain, the ETC block reward doesn't have as much outside demand, which theoretically puts downward pressure on the coin's price if miners need to sell the ETC they mine to pay for operations. Given the lack of meaningful network usage coupled with the surge in mean hash rate, ETC miners have seen profitability fall by about 70% since the merge. Grayscale's Ethereum Classic Trust All of this is particularly bad for Grayscale's Ethereum Classic Trust ( ETCG ) because the trust has such a large portion of the total ETC outstanding. According to the form 10-K that Grayscale just released for the trust, the company owns 8.5% of the ETC in circulation: As of December 31, 2022, the largest 100 ETC wallets held approximately 74.2% of the ETC in circulation, and as of December 31, 2022, the Trust holds approximately 8.5% of the ETC in circulation. Moreover, it is possible that other persons or entities control multiple wallets that collectively hold a significant number of ETC, even if they individually only hold a small amount, and it is possible that some of these wallets are controlled by the same person or entity. As a result of this concentration of ownership, large sales or distributions by such holders could have an adverse effect on the market price of ETC. I should also note that Grayscale's disclosure that 74.2% of the circulating coins held by the top 100 addresses is a really high level of concentration for a proof-of-work coin. Especially for a coin with such a higher market cap: Cryptocurrency Top 100 concentration Bitcoin 14.9% Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ) 34.0% Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) 43.5% Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) 67.4% Source: BitInfoCharts Even if Grayscale were to liquidate the trust and sell the ETC, the coin would still suffer from a very high level of owner concentration. Likely as a response to ETCG holders owning such an immense amount of the ETC in existence, the pressure on ETCG shares has been noticeably extreme, and we can see that manifesting through a NAV discount that remains at very depressed levels: ETCG Discount Trend (Coinglass) Even after bouncing off the floor of 77% in late December, ETCG is still trading at a 63% discount to net asset value as of Wednesday's close - which is the largest discount of any Grayscale fund. Summary ETCG is arguably one of the biggest contrarian bets in all of the public crypto-related tickers. Due to the lack of real user demand for the network or the ETC coin in general, I think a long bet on ETCG at this point is a bet that Grayscale will dissolve the trust and be able to distribute the proceeds from the coin sales for a larger value than where the fund shares are currently trading. That's not an impossible outcome, but it's a bet that I'm personally not willing to make at this time. If network demand for the coin was robust, I'd see a 63% discount as a slam-dunk arbitrage. We just don't have that opportunity in Ethereum Classic. I'm sympathetic to the ""coin is law"" mantra of the ETC community, and I think it would be great if there was more development happening on that chain. Despite the discount, I still can't get terribly interested in ETCG unless something changes dramatically in Ethereum's Classic activity. I'm not sure that's likely at this point but anything is possible.",NEGATIVE,BCH | ETC,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4584378-ethereum-classic-trust-five-months-after-the-merge?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10226688.jpeg

Whether an AI-generated bot could have written “Snow Crash,” Stephenson said, “well, maybe one did.” But if that were the case, he added, a person would be reading only the output of an algorithm, “and if that’s interesting to you, then fine.”  “Personally, I know a lot of writers who are putting a lot of effort into creating their own original works, and I’d rather support them and hear what they have to say than just look at the output of an algorithm,” he said.  ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot that was released in November and has gained notoriety.  Stephenson has placed different parts of “Snow Crash” on auction at Sotheby's, an during the same segment on ""First Mover,"" Cassandra Hatton, head of sales at Sotheby's, said the auction reflects a “transitional thing” that takes a look at items “that were created in an analog world,” but that were “predicting the future of the digital world.”  The auction, which went live on Sotheby’s metaverse NFT platform on Feb. 27, includes a 3D replica of the sword used by the novel’s protagonist, Hiro, alongside a non-fungible token and a manuscript of the book that Stephenson wrote in 1991.  Stephenson’s manuscript has a current bidding price of $35,000 with four bids, while the replica sword, with two bids, was priced at $55,000.

42411187,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLrwX,1677867949,ETHDenver Looks Cringey to You Because Ethereum Has an Actual Community,"This weekend marks the culmination of ETHDenver, probably the most important annual gathering for smart contract and decentralized finance (DeFi) developers right now, on Ethereum and beyond. I wish I could be there this year, but I’m still recovering from a pretty intense four months of making cool things and exposing bad guys.  Fortunately, plenty of people are sharing clips from the event, so I can enjoy it vicariously. Unfortunately, many of these posts express something between innocent confusion and sneering takedowns of the supposedly lame ETHDenver goings-on.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But that attitude, to paraphrase the fugitive philosopher-thief Do Kwon, is a great formula for getting rekt. It may look like silliness and disorganization to you, but ETHDenver’s rough edges are actually strong signals that a real community has been drawn together by shared interests to build something together from the ground up. That’s the kind of community that has and will weather slow periods of crypto growth like what we’re going through right now.  Low key, it’s also a signal that a lot of these people are far too rich to give a damn what you think.  See also: Tensions Erupt Between Aptos, Sui Blockchains in Denver  It’s hip to be cringe  It’s true that compared to a lot of crypto conferences ETHDenver and certain related events can seem just the slightest bit slapdash, and more than the slightest bit bizarre. Take, for instance, the annual contributions from Jonathan Mann, aka “The Song a Day Guy.” He has created and performed goofy, slightly amateurish tunes for the event for a while now – and every year people on Twitter take the opportunity to dunk on him.  But let me tell you, a goofy song is far from the only thing at ETHDenver that might make you uncomfortable!  When I attended last year, ETHDenver was held in a refurbished parking garage, where the bathrooms were partly or entirely broken for much of the event. You couldn’t see the main stage from roughly a third of the ground floor seating, and people talking at the back of the room halfway drowned out the speakers. Every once in a while, someone would drop 500 pizzas on an upstairs table, resulting in massive queues that made it nearly impossible to move.  And you know what? It was awesome.  ETHDenver, unlike almost any crypto event that’s sort of in the public eye, has the edge and energy of a great punk rock or hip hop show. It still manages to feel “do-it-yourself” in an era when marketing firms and huge budgets have come to dominate crypto events. It’s driven by an actual ethos instead of an ROI (return on investment) formula. The cracks and rough edges are a feature, not a bug.  (Though for the record, the event is in a different venue this year, so I hope the bathrooms are working.)  Rough edges, improvisation and scrappiness are certainly a turnoff for some sets of people – above all, financiers and those who aspire to that dubious designation. So-called institutional investors may not gain much reassurance about the seriousness of the Ethereum ecosystem from watching co-founder Vitalik Buterin do the badger dance.  But that’s more or less the point. The Ethereans sure aren’t crying about it. Like any good punk show, bits like Jonathan Mann’s opening ceremony are supposed to scare away normies, to leave them and their lives of quiet, hustling desperation just outside the circle of belonging.  And all the better: These are the vultures and vampires who spent 2021 making embarrassingly awful bets on frauds and charlatans. If you don’t understand the culture, the implicit logic goes, you probably don’t understand anything else happening here, either.  See also: Ethereum's Political Philosophy Explained | Opinion  At the same time, a willingness to not sweat appearances in an industry with absolute boatloads of money at stake may be the most alpha move on the board.  As crypto satirist Gabriel Haines puts it: “You think I give a f**k if you think I’m cringe? … I am a chad! I am the ballsiest man alive, to go on stage and sing a Disney song with my wife!”  You know what’s cool? A billion dollars  That indifference signals another important fact – a lot of the people attending ETHDenver have little or no need to be approachable, much less appealing, to the masses. That’s largely because it’s a thriving community of people who know each other and are already working together effectively.  But it’s also because a critical mass of the kind of people who go to ETHDenver have been involved in crypto, and Ethereum specifically, long enough that they’re sitting on pretty serious eff-you money, whether as individuals or organizations. When your treasury has an ETH cost basis of $2, even wild bubbles and crashes like 2021 and 2022 are essentially sideshows, and telling venture capitalists to take a long walk off a short pier is just another Friday.  By contrast, the slick, overproduced events that have come to dominate crypto in the last three years are far more focused on the appearance of achievement to drive short-term hype. When Arthur Hayes parked three rented lambos outside of CoinDesk's Consensus conference in New York in 2018, it was in its own way a sneering, punk-rock gesture. But it seems like nobody got the joke, and low-IQ grindset signaling is now an unfortunate norm at too many of crypto’s biggest events.  See also: Now I Know the Cryptocurrency Industry Is Here to Stay | Opinion  This makes many crypto conferences feel uncomfortably close to the exploitative grifts of genuinely bad weirdos like Tai Lopez – people who have magicked their own success out of thin air by selling pipe dreams of “making it” to others at an infinite markup. The kind of slick production that’s now standard at crypto events is, too often, a simulation of excitement and success, underwritten by forward-looking venture capital instead of any actual present achievement. More effort often goes into ginning up superficial hype than into actually building stuff people need. Such efforts may be aimed at generating real partnerships and growth – or they may simply be aimed at turning you into exit liquidity.  There’s nothing more cringey than having to beg for money – not just once but at every moment of your buttoned-up, angle-working, public-relations-orchestrated existence. ETHDenver seems remarkably free of that self-debasing imperative, and that makes it very cool indeed.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | APT | SUI,David Z.

""We can’t afford to let this industry run roughshod over our communities any longer.”  The bill itself is largely similar to last year's version.

42393858,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brQymz,1677865447,Bitcoin’s Slow Week Upended by Concerns Regarding Crypto Bank Silvergate,"After what had been a relatively slow week, bitcoin's (BTC) price fell sharply late Thursday as over $62 million in BTC long positions were liquidated during the Asian overnight trading session.  Bitcoin’s descent was rapid and concentrated, occurring during the 01:00 UTC (8:00 p.m. ET) trading hour. Negative reactions to viability concerns surrounding crypto bank Silvergate (SI) appeared to be the driving force behind the decline, which saw BTC fall $1,000 in minutes to $22,500 while ETH declined to $1,570.  Trading volume had been relatively mild on the week, prior to last night’s quick sell-off.  Bitcoin and ether (ETH) remain higher foro the year to date by 32% and 26%, respectively. However, both assets are now trading below their 20-day moving averages. On a technical basis, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) levels for BTC and ETH declined 36% and 22% since Feb. 23, highlighting a slowdown in momentum.  Volatility waned slightly over the same time period, with the Average True Range falling 5% for bitcoin and 2% for ether. The ATR is a market volatility indicator.  In comparison to crypto assets with a market cap of $1 billion or more, BTC and ETH’s performance landed it 10th and 14th among the group, respectively.  Correlations between crypto and traditional financial assets have loosened as well, with the correlation coefficient involving BTC, ETH and the S&P 500 sitting at -0.15.  The correlation coefficient ranges between 1 and -1, with the a higher positive read indicating a direct pricing relationship between assets, and a lower negative read implying an inverse relationship. A readout close to zero implies a very weak relationship over the time period being measured.  Stacks (STX) was the standout on the week, with its price advancing 15% over the most recent seven days, and 290% year to date.  STX is the native token for Stacks, the bitcoin layer 2 protocol which allows developers to build and deploy decentralized finance apps and non-fungible tokens (NFT) on the Bitcoin network.  Making an early bid for crypto story of the year, the STX token’s increase in price has been driven by the emergence of Ordinals, a protocol that allows NFTs to be included in bitcoin transactions. The extension of the Bitcoin network’s utility beyond peer-to-peer transactions will likely be impactful to both STX and BTC.  The week's laggards were SAND and HBAR, down 12.4% and 14.9%, respectively.  Economically, it was a relatively quiet week, with Wednesday’s ISM Manufacturing data and Thursday’s Initial Jobless Claims data being the primary data points of note. Neither had a significant impact on crypto prices.  Week-to-date performance among the CoinDesk CMI sectors shows negative numbers across the board.  The Digitization sector, which led in the prior week, fell to the bottom of the rankings. The DeFi sector, which trailed all last week, moved to the top. Members of the CoinDesk DeFi index include AAVE, Compound (COMP) and Uniswap (UNI).",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/03/bitcoins-slow-week-upended-by-concerns-regarding-crypto-bank-silvergate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a32f727a661d357d0c33f9991d71a2c73a06e759-3840x2177.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42435405,yQOv5bn58BVfxFU7cHP2bI,1677859360,"Uniswap Wants to Launch Crypto Wallet App, but Apple Says Not So Fast","DENVER – Uniswap Labs, which backs the top decentralized exchange (DEX) on Ethereum, is planning to launch a mobile crypto wallet for iPhone users, but Apple (AAPL) seems to have other ideas.  “Apple won’t yet green-light our launch and we don’t know why – we’ve responded to their concerns, answered every question and reiterated that we are 100% compliant with their specifications,” a spokesperson for Uniswap Labs told CoinDesk.  The unexplained delay may add to Apple’s perception as a hardline gatekeeper in regulating the crypto world’s access to iOS, its mobile software ecosystem. The iPhone maker has refused to adapt its commerce policies to accommodate some crypto companies and also bans crypto trading apps that don’t use an “approved exchange.”  As a DEX, however, it's unclear if Uniswap could ever meet Apple's ""approved exchange"" criteria. That could mean trouble for its non-custodial crypto wallet app because it plans to also have a swap feature that routes trades through Uniswap's permissionless – and unregulated – decentralized exchange.  Uniswap Labs Design Lead Callil Capuozzo said he doesn't think the company or DEX need to fit into existing regulatory regimes in order for the wallet app to launch.  Other crypto wallet apps on iOS already support DEX token swaps; market leader Metamask even routes some trades through Uniswap. Adding to the confusion, Capuozzo said Apple is giving different answers to different companies on what is and isn't copacetic.  ""It's a rulebook that nobody can read which is a really hard environment to operate in,"" he added.  Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Read also: Coinbase Disables Mobile NFT Transfers, Citing Apple’s App Store Policies  In a press release, Uniswap Labs said its planned mobile app is primarily a self-custodial crypto wallet, meaning users will have full ownership and control over their assets. The app will also offer the ability to “trade tokens directly with” Uniswap, where more than $1.2 billion in average 24-hour trading volume makes it by far the most trafficked decentralized finance (DeFi) exchange, per CoinGecko.  Rather than wait around for Apple, Uniswap Labs said it plans to release its app to 10,000 users via the TestFlight beta platform. Capuozzo said the limited release will give Uniswap an opportunity to show Apple its service is ""safe.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TRADING | UNI,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/03/uniswap-wants-to-launch-crypto-wallet-app-but-apple-says-not-so-fast,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f67be0d355e1ebe7a8a7e6ce12c6fe0bf7803039-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The research that Flashbots details will allow blocks to be built without revealing data on users’ transactions, a step toward enhancing privacy.  Flashbots has not given an immediate timeline when it will move out of the testnet.  Block builders are specialized third-party participants who construct blocks based on optimizing transactions. Block builders offer those blocks to relays, such as the relay Flashbots runs for MEV-Boost, in order to extract extra revenue made from reordering or including certain transactions.  A mempool is like a waiting room, where pending transactions are sorted and stored before they are added to create a new block.  Read more: What Is MEV, aka Maximal Extractable Value?  Flashbots told CoinDesk the move aims to enable privacy features on Ethereum. The code was made open source in an effort to decentralize block building on the Ethereum protocol.  “​​Implementing block building inside encrypted enclaves brings us one step closer toward transaction confidentiality and decentralization of the block building role,” Flashbots wrote in a blog post.  This is not the first time that Flashbots has made its code open source. In August, when Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control, Flashbots conveyed that its relay would also be censoring Tornado Cash transactions. As a result, Flashbots raced to open its code so others could decide whether to censor or not censor.  One reason open-source software is part of the Flashbots agenda is so others in the block-building space can “build off the shared knowledge and test other solutions,” the Flashbots team told CoinDesk. “And, in reality, try to break it!”  Read more: Flashbots Proposes New Class of ‘Matchmakers’ to Share MEV Gains With Ethereum Users",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | SPONSORED | RESEARCH,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/03/flashbots-open-sources-privacy-enhanced-block-builder-on-ethereum-testnet-sepolia,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/98e3ae0026c04e4cbe53e396c1a173c8e12595dc-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), two of the biggest advocates of cryptocurrencies among lawmakers, are opposing an April bulletin issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission intended to control how regulated financial institutions account for crypto, according to a recent letter sent to a number of banking agencies. The lawmakers pushed back against the SEC's so-called Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), arguing the effect of such a measure ""is to deny millions of Americans access to safe and secure custodial arrangements for digital assets."" SAB 121 would require financial firms to place digital assets on their balance sheets in what would ultimately ""trigger a massive capital charge,"" McHenry and Lummis wrote. For financial firms, off-balance sheet treatment of custodial assets has typically been the norm as history shows. “A recent decision in the Celsius ( CEL-USD ) bankruptcy, which classified all Celsius’ customers as unsecured creditors, and therefore at the back of the line to recover their assets, highlights the legal risk of effectively forcing customer custodial assets to be placed on balance sheet,” they emphasized. The lawmakers concluded the letter by asking the Federal Reserve and other banking agencies about whether SAB 121 conflicts with their own policies, and whether they've directed financial firms to comply with the bulletin. Amid a long string of high-profile failures in the crypto space in a short span, the SEC has been increasingly cracking down on the industry.

""This story is a reminder that there could still be more to come and it has undermined confidence in the space."" Additionally, strong economic data this week suggest that the Federal Reserve could resort to further tightening, which also dented risk sentiment.

Additionally, centralized exchanges liquidated bullish bitcoin futures worth over $62M during Asian trading hours, the most since August, CoinDesk reported citing Glassnode data. Thielen said Silvergate ( SI ) is likely facing more class action lawsuits due to lapses in its due diligence, which ""should've become aware that the interlinked Alameda, FTX ( FTT-USD ) and North Dimension accounts were used for fiat on-and-off ramp without being properly licensed.""

The race for the first ZK rollup to go live has accelerated recently. Later this month, Polygon will go live with its mainnet beta zkEVM. Scroll and Matter Labs have also announced they're coming out with ZK rollups, but haven't set dates.  “It's not crowded enough,” said Nicolas Liochon, the head of R&D at ConsenSys and lead for the ZK Business Group. “We think that it's important to have multiple zkEVMs, and we want to be one of them.”  ZkEVMs are ""virtual machines that can execute the same high-level programming languages or low-level bytecode as the Ethereum Virtual Machine, and prove this code using zero-knowledge proofs, cryptographic proofs that verify data without revealing any information about the data itself, such as properties or content,"" according to a November 2022 report on the topic from Galaxy Digital.  They're a type of ZK rollup that ""mimics the same transaction execution environment as mainnet Ethereum,"" according to the report.  A ZK rollup is a ""layer 2"" atop the main blockchain designed to process transactions faster and then send the data back to the ""layer 1."" ZK rollups use “proofs'' to prove that a transaction is valid and was not tampered with, by only showing a small piece of data from that transaction.  ConsenSys has not set a date for when their zkEVM will move out of the testnet phase, but Liochon said it should happen by the end of 2023.  Read more: What Are Rollups?

Eligible users will be able to withdraw all the funds in their accounts up to a certain limit, the company said in an earlier blog post.  Celsius secured approval to process certain withdrawals according to several U.S. court orders in January. In February, Celsius published a list of names of users who could withdraw assets locked on the platform, with the company saying at the time it had permission from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York to distribute 94% of each user's assets. Eligibility for withdrawals was dependent on certain criteria such as that transfers had to be less than $7,575 when they were originally made, the February document said, and users had to have enough assets on the platform to cover any withdrawal fees.  Celsius paused withdrawals last June, citing extreme market conditions, and it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a month later as it struggled with liquidity issues.

One River Digital, a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission-registered subsidiary of One River Asset Management, will become Coinbase Asset Management and will ""form the foundation"" of Coinbase's investment advisory service for institutional clients, the exchange said in a blog post Friday. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.  Coinbase has been looking to expand beyond its core retail trading business in response to the drop-off in transaction volume in recent months. Institutional investment management forms a part of that strategy, as does its move into the developer sector through its new layer 2 blockchain Base. It released Base's test network last week.  “This is about wanting to bring more institutional capital into the world of crypto,” Greg Tusar, Coinbase’s head of institutional product, told Bloomberg. “We expect to build – on the other side of this crypto winter – an awesome asset-management business.”  Some of Coinbase’s institutional products have come under scrutiny from regulators who have been taking a closer look at the crypto industry after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.

All in, the bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner's full-year results reflected ""significant growth in hash rate, successful expansion at our Rockdale Facility, continued progress on our Corsicana Facility development, and a lowering of our industry leading cost of Bitcoin production,"" said CEO Jason Les. The company said it restated its previously issued financial statements for 2021 and 2020 and for quarterly earnings for the first three quarters in 2022 and 2021 due to a bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) impairment accounting issue. ""Its method of calculating impairment charges of its Bitcoin assets, on a daily basis using a spot price at a standard cutoff time, was not in compliance,"" RIOT said. The rules require the intraday low of bitcoin to be used in calculating impairment. As such, the restatement adjusted the bitcoin impairment by an additional $7.5M in 2021 and $2.6M in 2020. Earlier this week, rival Marathon Digital ( MARA ) also found accounting errors and said it will restate some of its previously issued full-year and quarterly earnings.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,051 −48.0 ▼ 4.4% Bitcoin (BTC) $22,336 −986.9 ▼ 4.2% Ethereum (ETH) $1,566 −63.0 ▼ 3.9% S&P 500 futures 3,996.00 +11.3 ▲ 0.3% FTSE 100 7,947.07 +3.1 ▲ 0.0% Treasury Yield 10 Years 4.07% ▲ 0.1 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Top Stories  Bitcoin was down 5% early Friday, a day after a spout of negative developments surrounding crypto-friendly U.S. bank Silvergate Capital (SI).On Thursday, Coinbase (COIN), Circle, Paxos, Crypto.com, Bitstamp, Cboe Digital Markets, Galaxy Digital and Gemini all announced they will suspend Automated Clearing House transfers and other business operations with the bank. Silvergate's stock tumbled 58% to $5.72 on Thursday. The wider crypto market also lost ground with major altcoins taking a hit on Friday. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, shed 5%, filecoin (FIL) lost 9%, aptos (APT) was down 8%, and litecoin (LTC) dropped 7%.  The crypto futures market also took a hit, with exchanges liquidating longs or bullish bitcoin futures worth over $62 million during Asian trading hours on Friday. That's the highest amount since August, according to data from Glassnode. Meanwhile, short liquidations totaled just over $500,000. Liquidation happens when the market moves against a trader's bullish or bearish bet, leaving him or her with insufficient funds to keep the leveraged trade open. The dominance of long liquidations shows the leverage was skewed on the bullish side, meaning most traders were positioned for a price rally.  FTX said $8.9 billion in customer funds are missing, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal, saying FTX identified that amount in customer funds that it can’t account for. On Thursday, FTX, a crypto exchange that filed for bankruptcy in November, said it had identified around $2.7 billion of customer assets, compared with $11.6 billion of balances outstanding on customer accounts.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin miners unspent supply or the number of new coins held by miners rather than sold in the market  The number has declined by 2,000 BTC to 1.8 million BTC, the lowest since July 2021.  It's a sign of renewed selling by miners, or those responsible for minting new coins.

Coinbase is adapting its business model through crypto asset cycles. With crypto ETFs holding 9 out of the top 10 spots for highest performing equity ETFs YTD, investor interest has been returning to crypto. The first U.S. ETF with ""crypto"" in its name was the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ), which was launched on May 21, 2021. Prior to that, there were very few public crypto equities. The most well-known IPO was Coinbase Global (COIN) which did not occur until April 14, 2021. Coinbase's IPO coincided with the growth of the crypto industry which peaked in 2021 when Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hovered around the ~$60,000 range. In the ETF world, this was followed by several ETF launches not just from crypto-focused companies like Bitwise, but also traditional players like Invesco, Schwab, and Fidelity. Its launch as a public company also brought investors and analysts with a key advantage-public SEC filings with insight into both industry and company data. Currently, Coinbase is one of the largest constituents (4.3% index weight) of the Alerian Galaxy Global Cryptocurrency-Focused Blockchain Equity, Trusts and ETPs Index, which is the underlying index for the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF ( SATO ). The following are takeaways from Coinbase's most recent 10-K published on February 21, 2023, including industry insights and updates from the 2021 to the 2022 10-K. Coinbase is adapting its business model through crypto asset cycles. In the business overview section of the 2022 10-K, Coinbase added a section discussing asset price volatility and crypto cycles. The company points out four major crypto asset price cycles that occurred since 2010 with each cycle lasting approximately two to four years (illustrated in the chart below which was also newly included in this year's 10-K). Because of limited ability to forecast the crypto cycle and predict revenue, the company has implemented cost-cutting measures including workforce reductions in order to maintain profitability throughout downturns. The company reduced its headcount by 18% in June 2022, followed by another 21% workforce reduction in January 2023. Coinbase believes that the latest workforce reduction will reduce technology, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses by 30% y/y in 1Q23. Coinbase has also stated that they will take a more ""rigorous approach"" to investment in new products and also added language that shifts away from their historically acquisitive business. In 2022, the company recorded $101.4 million in gross impairment charges due to strategic investments and acquisitions that performed more poorly than expected due to economic conditions. Coinbase Global 2022 10-K Increased focus on subscription revenue including interest income from USDC. Transaction revenue accounted for 91.4% of the company's net revenue in 4Q21, but only 53.2% of net revenue in 4Q22. This was mostly due to lower asset prices and lower trading volumes, but also due to an increase in subscription revenue which was mostly derived from USDC (a stablecoin backed by the US dollar). The higher interest rate environment contributed to both higher interest income from USDC and interest earned from customer fiat balances held on the platform. The company states, however, that if interest rates were to significantly decline from 2022 levels, that subscription revenues could also significantly decline. Coinbase addresses custody and the failure of FTX, Celsius Networks, Voyager, and Three Arrow Capital. While Coinbase claims to have no material direct impact, it addresses that these 2022 events did cause changes in crypto market prices, crypto market volatility, and customer sentiment. Specifically, that includes loss of confidence in the broader crypto economy, reputational harm to crypto platforms like Coinbase, negative publicity, and increased scrutiny by regulators and lawmakers. They also reiterated holding assets 1:1 and not lending or rehypothecating client assets. In June 2022, the company updated its Retail User Agreement to grant legal protection to custodied crypto assets in the event of a bankruptcy. Coinbase caveats, however, that due to the novelty of crypto assets, courts have not yet considered this type of treatment for custodied crypto assets. Regulatory and legal classifications like commodities vs. securities are still highly debated. Based by language by both the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), certain crypto assets may be classified as commodities and certain ones may be classified as securities. But there is not a clear or consistent classification framework. Coinbase added language to its filing referring to itself as ""asset-agnostic"" and seeking to access to every asset where it is safe and legal to do so. But despite this language change, customers have returned focus back to the basics-Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). In 4Q21, Bitcoin and Ethereum each contributed 16% to trading volume, with the remaining 68% going to other crypto assets. But in 4Q22, Bitcoin held 35% of Coinbase's trading volume, Ethereum held 33% of trading volume, and other crypto assets were only 33%. The company will no longer disclose verified users. For the year ending 2022, the company reports a 24% increase in verified users which includes all consumers, institutions, and developers that have a registered account on the platform. The company formerly used this metric as an indication of scale; however, they no longer believe that this metric provides meaningful insight into its business performance so this metric will be discontinued in the next 1Q23 earnings report. While a change in metrics can be viewed as a negative, this change seems rational since verified users tracks registration and not necessarily activities that lead to revenue generation. Bottom Line: While the crypto economy remains volatile, large crypto companies like Coinbase are able to adapt their business to changing market conditions. Because the crypto economy is still in its early stages, it is extremely difficult to time the market and pick stocks within this sector-even with the added clarity provided by public SEC filings. With crypto ETFs holding 9 out of the top 10 spots for highest performing equity ETFs YTD, investor interest has been returning to crypto. Rules-based index-linked products like ETFs may provide an investor with exposure to the crypto economy, while diversifying away some of the aforementioned single-stock risk.

42414222,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB2wEg,1677841511,Bitcoin-Bridged to Avalanche Reaches Record Daily Mint of Over 2K BTC,"Interest in bridging bitcoin (BTC) to the Avalanche smart contract blockchain (BTC.b) continues to swell as the supply of wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), the largest wrapped version of bitcoin on Ethereum, dwindles.  On Thursday, over 2,000 BTC ($44 million) was ported to Avalanche, the largest single-day BTC.b mint on record, according to data sourced from pseudonymous analyst 0xAcid's dashboard on Dune Analytics. That has lifted the total circulating supply of BTC.b to 8,572.  According to 0xAcid, half of the bitcoin minted on Thursday has been moved to BENQI Finance. BENQI Finance is an Avalanche-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, which allows users to lend, borrow and earn additional yields from digital assets.  In June 2022, Avalanche added support for bitcoin on its cross-chain bridge, allowing BTC holders to deploy their coins in the Avalanche-based decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem to generate extra yield. BTC.b has seen impressive growth since then, surpassing the number of coins held in the Lightning Network.  A crypto bridge is a tool that facilitates interactions between the two economically and technologically separate blockchains. Bridges became a target of hackers last year, accounting for about 70% of the total exploits in the crypto industry last year, according to forensics firm Chainalysis.  The record BTC.b mint comes as the WBTC supply fell by 15% to 153,164 in February, reaching the lowest since March 2021. Apparently, bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network, a well-known WBTC holder, redeemed a large amount of WBTC, causing a sharp drop in the token's supply.  WBTC, issued by Bitgo, is an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum network with its price pegged 1:1 with bitcoin. The token's supply peaked at 285,000 in April last year and has been falling ever since.  The Avalanche community considers BTC.b a better option than WBTC, considering Avalanche offers users the ability to mint and redeem BTC.b anytime with the bridge in a non-custodial browser extension Core, eliminating the need for intermediaries. It provides more control to users, unlike WBTC, which relies on merchants to initiate the process of minting and burning.  According to Emperor Osmo, an anonymous writer for Cosmos-based automated market maker Osmosis, the investors in AVAX, the native token of Avalanche, are yet to take notice of BTC's growing use in DeFI, as evidenced by BTC.b's rising supply.  ""Over $200M of BTC has been bridged to Avalanche [to date]. The BTC DeFi narrative is definitely not priced in for AVAX,"" Osmo tweeted early Friday.  At press time, AVAX traded nearly 6% lower on the day, near $16, the lowest since Jan. 20.

42414208,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB2v7h,1677833580,"Bitcoin Bears May Still Be a Bit Early, Though Caution Urged: Matrixport","Matrixport, a crypto exchange and lending platform, said it has been bullish on digital assets since mid-December, but signals from the U.S. economy are now forcing it to be more cautious.  In a research report published early Friday, the firm said it is still not the time to be outright bearish, but suggested cutting exposure by 50% if bitcoin (BTC) prices fall below $22,800. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap slumped overnight and was trading around $22,400 at publication time.  U.S. stock markets have started to sell off again and U.S. bond yields are moving higher, the note said. The two-year Treasury now yields about 4.87%, above the November 2022 high of 4.8%, and the difference, or spread, between the two-year and 10-year yields is at an “unhealthy level of -0.87%.""  The rallying U.S. dollar is another negative sign and “adds to the restrictive monetary policy overhang,” wrote Markus Thielen, head of research.  Daily crypto trading volumes have dropped to $60 billion from around $80 billion, which shows less interest from traders to engage with the crypto market, “while the ongoing outflows from Paxos-Binance (BUSD) stablecoin have resulted in the market cap declining to now $10 billion,” the report said. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold.  The 60-day correlation between bitcoin and the Nasdaq stock index is at its lowest level since December 2021, when the U.S. Federal Reserve first started to communicate to the market that interest-rate increases were on the horizon, the report noted.  “This correlation breakdown is supportive for holding long crypto exposure as investors can hold onto the future technological growth expectations while the downside from macro data appears to be more impactful for U.S. listed technology shares.”  Matrixport said it remains convinced that U.S. inflation will fall sharply this year and that as a result, the Fed will stop raising interest rates, setting up the market for a relief rally.

Short liquidations worth just over $500,000 were also observed.  Liquidation happens when the market moves against a trader's bullish/bearish bet, leaving them with insufficient funds to keep the leveraged trade open.  The dominance of long liquidations shows the leverage was skewed on the bullish side, meaning most traders were positioned for a price rally.  Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell over 5% to $22,000, reaching the lowest since Feb. 14, CoinDesk data show.  Shares in Silvergate fell 50% on Thursday after the crypto-friendly lender said it's evaluating ""its ability to continue as a going concern"" and delayed filing its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Wood; Who Is Right?,"Summary Tyler Winklevoss has previously stated Ethereum should be worth as much as digital gold. Cathie Wood is even more bullish, predicting Ethereum to reach a market cap of $20 trillion. I attempt to make a more realistic valuation of ETH. Thesis Summary In a 2020 interview with Casey Adams, Tyler Winklevoss talked about the future of Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and its applications. Taking his arguments to their logical conclusion, he seems to imply ETH could be worth close to $80,000. More recently, Cathie Wood said ETH could reach a market cap of $20 trillion by 2030. However, I believe both of their assessments are too optimistic. Ultimately, putting a long-term price tag on something like Ethereum is a speculative endeavour, but it will help us understand where its value comes from and how we can benefit from it. Winklevoss Vs. Wood Tyler Winklevoss gave an interview a while back focusing on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum. The CEO of Gemini talked about the applications of Ethereum and ended by saying it could be worth as much as digital gold, if not more. In the first part of this interview, he had some great insights, but I do not agree with comparing ETH to digital gold. Winklevoss compared Ethereum to Facebook, now Meta ( META ) back in its early days. Facebook was a revolutionary social media website, but it also became a platform on which other companies could build their own companies. A prime example of this was Zynga, which eventually IPO’d in 2011 and was bought out for $12.7 billion last year. Ethereum can also be thought of as a decentralized AWS since it allows anyone to create and host their applications on the Ethereum blockchain. This is all true and can help us reach a valuation for ETH. However, Winklevoss ends the interview by saying that Ethereum could be worth as much, if not more, than digital gold. Gold has a market capitalization of roughly $10 trillion, while at today’s price of $1650, Ethereum’s market cap stands at around $200 billion. Assuming ETH’s supply doesn’t change, though most estimates suggest ETH should remain deflationary after the merge, this would mean each ETH would have to be worth 50x more than its current price, giving us a price target of $80,000. More recently, Cathie Wood predicted that the market cap of Ethereum could reach $20 trillion : As financial services move on-chain, decentralized networks are likely to take share from existing financial intermediaries, the report said. Ark Invest predicts Ether will be a primary beneficiary of this shift. Source: Markets Insider At a $20 trillion market cap, Ethereum would be worth twice what Tyler Winklevoss predicted, somewhere around $160,0000. While I am bullish on Ethereum, I think both assessments are too optimistic. Disputing Cathie and Tyler In Tyler Winklevoss’s defence, this is an off-the-cuff comment, which, more than trying to give a price target for ETH, is intended to portray that he believes ETH should be worth more than Bitcoin, the actual digital gold. While, indeed, ETH has significantly more potential and applications than Bitcoin, we can’t just compare its market cap to that of gold and call it a day. The Gemini CEO was on the right track when comparing Ethereum to Facebook, so let’s expand on this. If we imagine Ethereum as a company, what could its potential revenues be? Software Revenue Forecast (Statista) The chart above, provided by Statista , shows a forecast for worldwide revenues in the Software industry. In 2023, software revenues are expected to grow to $650 billion, and by 2027, this figure could be $812 billion, implying a CAGR of 5.72%. Just to round things out, if we assume a similar growth rate, then by 2031, worldwide software revenues could be around $1 trillion. Now, the next question we should answer is, how much of the software industry will be “hosted” on Ethereum by 2031? Let’s be very optimistic and say that 50% of the market is on Ethereum. We now have a “company” with $500 billion in revenues. We can then apply an average software industry P/S of around 10, giving us a potential valuation of $5 trillion. Making the same assumptions as before, we obviously get a target price of half of our previous estimates, $40,000. Now, this is a more realistic price target but still probably too high. It’s very unlikely that ETH will take over 50% of the software market in 10 years. More likely, we’d be looking at a tenth of that. However, ETH is also not a traditional company, and if indeed it manages to capture 5% of business in the industry, then its valuation, in terms of P/S should be much higher. Moving on to the ARK thesis this is based on the idea that Ethereum can take a big chunk of the financial sector market cap. According to ResearchandMarkets , the financial services market could be worth $45 trillion by 2031. Financial services forecast (researchandmarkets) Therefore it would appear that ARK Invest predicts that ETH could take almost 50% of the market cap of this segment. This seems very optimistic even 8 years from now. Ethereum will face a lot of challenges on its way to gaining such market cap, most of all regulatory and competition-wise. Unlike the software industry, financial services are highly regulated. Even when financial players do move on-chain, a lot of them will want to do so on their own terms, not through a blockchain that, in principle, is decentralized. I believe a more realistic market share would be closer to 10%, at most, giving us a market cap of $4.5 trillion and a price of $36,000 for Ethereum by 2030. Final Considerations Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin, like companies, must be valued for what they can be. Bitcoin can be considered digital gold, but Ethereum is more like digital oil. If the Ethereum blockchain becomes the home of the next generation of software companies and financial services , then ETH will literally be the gas that fuels this ecosystem. With that said, Ethereum doesn’t stand on its own. In order to function properly, by which I mean quickly and cheaply, it will have to rely on many Layer 2 solutions such as Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) or Optimism ( OP-USD ). These altcoins have a lot more potential for growth and appreciation, and I cover them regularly in my marketplace.",NEUTRAL,ETH,ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4584109-ethereum-valuation-winklevoss-vs-wood-who-is-right?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10198619.jpeg

42410824,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggrtb6,1677806660,Was Silvergate on Borrowed Time as Regulators Backed Banks Away From Crypto?,"One of the crypto sector's core banks, Silvergate Capital Corp., is being hollowed out in a classic customer retreat familiar to students of bank-run history.  The latest and most severe flight of customers from the La Jolla, California-based institution was accelerated this week by the bank’s own disclosures, including an admission that its health could be threatened by ""investigations from our banking regulators,"" according to a March 1 document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. With that disclosure and Silvergate's open questioning of ""the viability of the company's digital asset focused business,"" major customers such as Coinbase, Paxos, Circle Internet Financial and Galaxy Digital moved to sever ties.  The bank’s stock price fell more than 50% on Thursday, and is down about 95% over the past year.  Recent hard times for crypto firms have definitely been shared by their favorite banks, but the banking regulators have also been targeting those lenders with warnings about leaning too heavily into crypto, arguing that the banks' stability could suffer from exposure to a volatile market. Silvergate was basically what they were talking about, as illustrated by the sudden flight of its top crypto customers.  The company had become virtually synonymous with crypto banking, and the opening page of its website still touts the relationships it built with the industry after seeing ""digital currency's potential"" in the early years. Part of that relationship may have become toxic for Silvergate as it was reportedly linked to investigations of the FTX exchange's fraudulent activity.  U.S. banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., have been campaigning to erect a barrier between the banking system they oversee and the crypto industry they've labeled as a leading hazard for the traditional financial sector. The agencies' policy statements carefully laid out a case against banks that concentrate on digital assets and the companies that issue and trade them. And in a new statement just last week, they again warned the banks their deposits could drain quickly away as ""customers react to crypto-asset-sector-related market events, media reports, and uncertainty.""  ""Clearly, they're urging extreme caution,"" said Alexandra Barrage, a banking lawyer at Davis Wright Tremaine who was previously a senior official at the FDIC. She said they likely had Silvergate and similar banks in mind when they issued these warnings, which she said have shown an unusual willingness for the banking agencies to ""provide some guardrails"" about what they don’t want to see.  'Heightened scrutiny'  Silvergate, which has delayed the filing of its annual report, disclosed this week that it was uncertain about its ""ability to comply with the heightened regulatory scrutiny of banking institutions that provide products and services to the digital asset industry.""  When it refers to its banking regulators, Silvergate is talking about the Federal Reserve on the federal level and the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation at the state level.  One of the jobs of Fed supervisors is to watch an institution's capital levels, ensuring they don't slide below the danger line. Last year, a key measure – Silvergate's so-called leverage ratio that measures its own capital as a share of its overall assets – slid almost 6 percentage points from a healthy 11% to a little over 5%. The cutoff for a bank to still be considered well-capitalized is 5%, and the bank was already dropping toward that mark a couple of months ago.  A bank getting close to the danger level of 4% will generally hear from the FDIC, Barrage said. The FDIC is the U.S. agency responsible for handling bank failures and ensuring that customers are harmed as little as possible.  ""I'm sure there's a lot of stuff happening behind the scenes,"" Barrage said, adding that they're likely ""trying to figure out if there's a solution that works.""  A spokeswoman for the FDIC told CoinDesk that ""we don't discuss open and operating institutions."" When asked why the Fed hasn't been seen to intervene, a spokesman for the U.S. central bank declined to comment on its supervision of the institution. However, if regulators had privately stepped in and made demands about the company's management, their interactions would not necessarily have been public, so it's unclear how much the agencies may have been involved with Silvergate's struggles. A spokesman for the California regulator also declined to comment.  A Silvergate representative declined to address the bank's regulatory pressures and capital woes on Thursday, sending a statement to CoinDesk that it's ""working diligently"" to file its annual report and has no further comment.  One banking industry veteran now in the crypto sector said he wondered why it's taking regulators so long to deal with a floundering bank. The policy executive, who declined to be named, said the FDIC should probably have knocked on their door months ago.  When banks fail, they typically go down on a Friday night. A crew from the FDIC shows up and takes the keys so their specialists can work over the weekend and get the customer base on secure footing by the next Monday. Usually, they hand the deposits over to a new owner to manage and they get started finding buyers for the remaining assets.  Thanks to FDIC insurance, U.S. depositors' money is safe, as long as it's not more than $250,000. Even if the ownership transition isn't smooth, the federal government guarantees every penny up to the limit – as it's done through every bank crisis of the past 89 years – and the FDIC can cut a check if there's no new bank to point customers to.  The FDIC took down hundreds of institutions in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, but it hasn't had a closure to deal with in the past two years.  The agency does not, however, insure digital assets. Any cryptocurrencies held on behalf of a bank's clients are not shielded by any government protections.  Were Silvergate to fail and enter into an FDIC teardown, it would break unfortunate new ground for the industry.  ""This would mark the first crypto-specific receivership,"" Barrage said.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: A busy economic week in China with plenty of data releases scheduled might be what it takes to get bitcoin out of its slump.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Good morning.  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) remain fairly flat as Asia starts its business day, despite concerns over the accessibility of future access to banking rails in the U.S.  Bitcoin is trading at $23,441, down 0.9% in the last 24 hours, while ether is down 1.2% and trading at $1,646.  In the last 24 hours, access to banking for crypto companies in the U.S. has become a greater concern. Silvergate, which has marketed itself as a crypto-friendly bank, has seen the majority of its client base depart for rival Signature after it delayed filing its annual report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In late December, Signature said it was looking to reduce its crypto-related deposits by $10 billion and is being sued for “substantially facilitating” comingling of funds at FTX.  All this is coming after a Jan. 3 joint press release from the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) that presented concern over the risks crypto assets place on banking organizations.  At the same time, there continues to be optimism coming out of the East.  It’s going to be a busy week in China for data releases.  On Tuesday, it's set to release data on the balance of trade figures for January and February. Analysts are expecting a major jump from $78 billion for the last period to $100 billion.  Year-over-year export and import data for the period is also expected to improve. Earlier this week, upbeat manufacturing data from China pushed bitcoin up by 4%.

The “Percent Addresses in Profit” indicator illustrates the percentage of unique addresses whose average purchase price sits below the current price for bitcoin. Historically readings below 50 have indicated that BTC is oversold, and thus, represent a potential bottom.  Readings above 95% indicate a potential top.

42421073,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXWRdl,1677803200,"Founder of Blur, the Pro NFT Marketplace Driving Billions in Trades, Reveals What's Next","It was just over four months ago when Blur launched as a no-fee non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace targeting ""pro"" NFT traders. Its no-frills user interface and advanced features like “floor sweeping” across multiple marketplaces, fast ""snipe reveals"" and portfolio analytics tools, quickly made it a favorite among fast-paced traders looking to get the best deal and maximize profits.  Blur's popularity spiked last month upon the release of its native BLUR token, which had been steadily airdropped to its users in the form of care packages over several months as a reward for trading activity. The token allows holders to participate in the platform’s governance protocol and profit from the community-owned marketplace.  Several data aggregators and user-generated dashboards indicate that Blur has sailed past top NFT marketplace OpenSea in terms of trading volume in recent weeks. According to DappRadar's February Industry Report, Blur made up 64.8% ($1.32 billion) of the NFT market share last month, with trading activity ""largely driven by NFT whales farming on the platform.""  And while OpenSea continues to lead in the number of daily users, according to the data, Blur's meteoric rise has spooked OpenSea enough to make it change its creator royalties and platform fees to stay competitive.  See Also: NFT Trading Volumes Hit $2B in February, Highest Since LUNA Crash, Thanks to Blur  Blur's crystal-clear vision  Speaking to CoinDesk, Blur co-founder Pacman, who revealed himself to be 24-year-old developer and investor Tieshun Roquerre last week, said that OpenSea's shortcomings were what initially motivated him to create a platform for more advanced NFT traders.  ""I really fell in love with the NFT space. I love the trading side of it,"" he said of his early days trading NFTs, which he started doing during the time he founded several successful tech companies out of San Francisco. ""I was just very frustrated. And using OpenSea at the time, I just felt like it was very slow and clunky – you know, good for newcomers, but for someone that was more experienced and native in the space, it felt like I was fighting the platform a lot.""  He set out to grow a platform aimed at courting more advanced NFT traders, which he likened to ""a Binance for NFTs."" He also cites decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap and Chinese e-commerce platform Taobao as inspirations for Blur's tokenomics and growth strategy.  The platform raised $11 million in seed funding led by Web3 investment giant Paradigm in March 2022, which helped it build the foundations for its ambitious roadmap and plans to ""move the NFT space toward becoming institutional grade while increasing decentralization.""  The MIT and Y Combinator alum, alongside his pseudonymous co-founder Galaga, assembled a team of 10 builders from across the fintech and trading worlds to bring the vision to life.  Pacman told CoinDesk that his choice to initially be pseudonymous gave him the opportunity to pull back the curtain on Blur's mysterious inner workings at any point.  ""Once we launched the token and started decentralizing, I think the attention on Blur just became so great,"" he explained. ""If people are wondering, it's gonna come out anyway ... It feels like the right time.""  Amplifying the royalty debate  Part of Blur's rapid succession has been its ability to tap into the wants of professional traders. By taking no commission and allowing its users to pay optional royalties back to creators, Blur has become a highly liquid, fast-paced trading platform.  This model, while appealing to a more experienced crowd, has also irked many developers, creators and collectors who believe that the NFT market is slowly moving agency and profits away from artists.  Roquerre expressed mixed feelings towards creator royalties, stressing their importance while also lamenting a changing NFT landscape in response to a prolonged crypto winter.  ""One of the reasons why I personally fell in love with NFTs was because they're not commodities, they are digital collectibles,"" he said, likening the experience of trading them to collecting and trading Pokémon cards. ""When it comes to royalties, our position has always been 'how can we maximize royalties in a scalable, durable way?'""  He noted that marketplace attitudes toward enforcing creator royalties began to shift in the summer, when several marketplaces, including Sudoswap, began removing royalties to spark lagging trading volumes. Soon, even the most mainstream platforms, such as Magic Eden and LooksRare, began making royalties optional, creating an environment where fees needed to be reduced in order for marketplaces to stay competitive.  ""Royalty enforcement is the prisoner's dilemma,"" he said. ""Our thinking was 'okay, so there are these zero royalty venues, can we at least incentivize traders to go away from them, and instead, at least honor some royalties?'""  Roquerre noted that Blur encouraged traders to honor creator royalties by offering more BLUR token rewards to traders that listed NFTs with full royalties during its second token airdrop. ""It didn't work perfectly, but it did have an impact on the royalty enforcement.""  Ultimately, Blur was locked into a battle with top competitor OpenSea for weeks, after the latter began blocking NFTs originally minted on its platform from being resold on secondary marketplaces that didn't enforce full creator royalties (Blur included). OpenSea took a firm position on honoring creator royalties, but recently shifted its policy as Blur began dominating the NFT market share.  ""We think it's really sad for communities when big players in the space say they're going to do something and then change what they say a month later,"" Roquerre said. ""So we try only ever to put out policies that we can honor and not have to change.""  A community-driven future  Blur's success despite not taking any platform fees has baffled some analysts, who have suggested that Blur is aggregating user data. The assumption is based on Blur's privacy policy, which states that it collects information like browsing history, email addresses and job history that can be used to create a consumer profile.  ""My question is, who's the end client?"" Mr. 0, a pseudonymous internet personality and product lead for Web3 software suite Quantum, told CoinDesk. ""Who would they sell this data to? Because 'if you're not paying for the product, you are the product' is a common internet adage.""  Roquerre denied that the platform was harvesting user data and said its privacy policy was ""pretty standard."" He added that the data it collects is all publicly visible on the blockchain. Still, he pledged to update the privacy policy to clarify its intent to users.  In addition, he explained that his relationship with Paradigm dates back to 2018, when they invested in one of his earlier projects called Namebase. Paradigm is also an investor in Uniswap, which Blur looked to for inspiration in building out its protocol and tokenomics.  In February, Blur embarked on a more decentralized approach to expanding its platform, allowing BLUR token holders to participate in the platform’s governance and control the protocol's value accrual and distribution. The Blur Foundation was also set up at the time to help foster community growth.  Ultimately, Roquerre said the platform's future will be heavily influenced by its community, which has access to a treasury that holds 39% of the total BLUR token supply.  ""The community can vote on treasury grants that can be used for development features or various initiatives,"" he said, adding that they could also vote to allocate the treasury towards ""a new economic design,"" which may include introducing platform fees at some point in the future in order to generate additional revenue.  ""The philosophy that we kind of had in designing the system as core contributors is that we wanted to be able to deliver value immediately, have a clear story for why the protocol is able to accrue value, and ultimately give the holders the flexibility to utilize different schemes in the future as market conditions change,"" he concluded.

With its second and third facilities fully contracted out and set to be energized in the very near future, management expects to generate $100 million of annual EBITDA. With a REIT structure in its future and favorable EV/Adj. EBITDA metrics versus traditional data center REITs, the recent insider buying into this busted IPO merited a deeper dive. A full investment analysis follows in the paragraphs below. The desire for safety stands against every great and noble enterprise .”― Tacitus Today, we take our first look at a small cap ' Busted IPO ' with a somewhat unique niche. The stock has given its shareholders a wild ride over the past couple of years. There are some potential catalysts on the horizon. An analysis follows below. Company Overview Applied Digital Corporation ( APLD ) is a Dallas based operator of ‘next generation’ data centers, which it designs and constructs to provide substantial high-performance computing [HPC] power to customers – primarily cryptocurrency miners. The company has one operational facility with 100 Megawatts (MW) of capacity in North Dakota, as well as a 200MW data center in Texas and a second facility (180MW) in North Dakota both due to come online by the end of February 2023. Applied Digital was originally a miner of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD), housing its hardware in China. When the Chinese government cracked down on mining facilities located within its borders, the company sought hosting facilities elsewhere, eventually resulting in the construction of its first data center and an exit from its mining operations. Able to sell its vision of predictable recurring revenue, it went public as Applied Blockchain in April 2022, raising net proceeds of $36 million at $5 a share. Applied Digital stock trades around $2.50 a share now, translating to a market cap of roughly $250 million. May Company Presentation The company operates on fiscal year (FY) ending May 31st. Data Centers and Crypto-Mining For those not involved in cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin transactions are posted on the network’s public ledger (the blockchain) using the secure hash algorithm, which is designed for digital signatures. The network pays Bitcoin miners to bundle recent transactions utilizing the cryptocurrency into ‘blocks’, which are then validated when the miner solvers cryptographic problems. Solving these problems requires the heavy-duty computational power of mining servers housed in data centers. The greater the computational power to validate the transactions, the greater the portion of compensation received by the miner. As a further economic wrinkle, owing to the fact that there is only a fixed amount of Bitcoins (21 million) to ever be issued, as time goes by, miners receive diminishing pay for their services. To illustrate, in 2009 when Bitcoin launched, each block created was worth 50 Bitcoins. By design, this compensation falls by half every four years, meaning that in 2024 each block created will be worth 3.125 Bitcoins. When a miner’s revenue falls by half, energy consumption must fall proportionately or the activity of creating blocks becomes increasingly uneconomic. That is where Applied Digital’s ultra-low cost digital infrastructure is crucial. Approach The company provides energized space to customers, who place their hardware within its co-hosting facilities. Its next generation data centers consume copious amounts of energy to keep the servers powered and cool. As such, its facilities are better suited for remote geographies with low power costs. Owing to this distinction, it is difficult to convert legacy data centers – which are typically close to metropolitan areas for low latency Web 2.0 functions such as streaming – to next generation properties. May Company Presentation Obviously, maintaining the blockchain is not the sole function of HPC data centers, but it has been for the company’s 100MW facility in North Dakota, which hosts five cryptocurrency miners. Furthermore, the two facilities scheduled to be energized very shortly (Management stated the end of February in last communication) are fully contracted by agreements with crypto miners. It is anticipated that the nearly 500MW of operating capacity from the three data centers will generate annual EBITDA of $100 million. May Company Presentation That said, Applied Digital is attempting to broaden its customer base, taking the first steps in 2QFY23 with the signing of its first two non-crypto clients, of which one will be housing its equipment at a currently under construction 5MW processing center purpose-built for graphics processing units located next to its 100MW facility. In preparation for this expansion into other HPC use cases – including artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, drug discovery, graphics rendering, and other Web 3.0 functions – the company changed to its current moniker in November 2022. According to Verified Market Research, Web 3.0 applications will comprise a $65 billion market by 2030. In addition to its ongoing buildout, Applied Digital entered into a 50/50 joint venture (dubbed Highland Digital) with GMR Limited to target distressed mining hardware and digital infrastructure asset acquisitions up to $100 million in September 2022. Funding will be provided from outside investors, meaning the company will not directly contribute capital to the JV. Share Price Performance Although Applied Digital’s IPO was priced at $5 per share, its extremely volatile stock has touched that level just once (June 2, 2022), only to be trading under $1 a share eight trading sessions later. The only news items during that time were the recapture of 4.97 million shares (5% of total outstanding) from a vendor who could no longer provide services and the end of the lock-up period for 36.4 million shares. The stock then doubled in value (to $2.12) on volume of more than 131 million shares after news that Applied Digital had entered into a five-year hosting contract with crypto miner Marathon Digital ( MARA ) for 270MW of Bitcoin mining capacity on July 29, 2022. That positive story was tempered by a concurrent bulletin that its facility was partially (~50%) offline due to unexpected equipment failure at the substation powering the facility with full-service not restored until mid-August. After the dust settled on those developments, shares of APLD traded in a ‘relatively narrow’ range of $1.45 to $2.62 since the end of July until a breakout in January, before recently falling back into that trading range. 2QFY23 Earnings & Outlook With its one operational facility at more than 90% capacity for all of 2QFY23 – and fully contracted on multi-year contracts – Applied Digital reported financial results on January 9, 2023, posting a loss of $0.04 a share (non-GAAP) and negative Adj. EBITDA of $2.1 million on revenue of $12.3 million. There are no prior year comparators as the company was not generating revenue at that time. The bottom line was two pennies better than Street consensus while the top line was $140,000 better. Applied Digital did provide an operational update in which (as stated previously) it expects both its Texas and second North Dakota facilities to be energized by the end of February 2023, but hasn't announced yet if they are on line yet. Substantially all of the capacity from the latter and 90MW from the former will fulfill the Marathon contract, which should produce annual revenue of ~$100 million. Balance Sheet & Analyst Commentary As of November 30, 2022, the company held cash and equivalents of $18.1 million and debt of $20.5 million. With prospects for profitability in calendar 2023, Applied Digital is a favorite of Street analysts, who feature one outperform and six buy ratings and a median price target of $3.85. It should be noted that targets have been lowered at three firms since October 2022 to reflect a delay (versus prior expectations) in the ramp schedule of the company’s Texas facility. Chairman & CEO Wes Cummins is also bullish. Representing the interests of B Riley Asset Management, he has purchased 300,000 shares since the company’s 2QFY23 earnings report. It should be noted that he is also very personally vested, with his account reflecting over 3.7 million shares and his family trust owning an additional 17.6 million shares. Verdict The irony with the volatility in Applied Digital’s stock is that the company will most likely transform its capital structure to a real estate investment trust – like traditional data center REITs Digital Realty Trust ( DLR ) and Equinix ( EQIX ) – once it reaches critical mass. Obviously, comparisons are challenging when Digital Realty operates over 300 locations and Applied Digital is hoping to have three energized by the end of February 2023. That said, Digital Realty trades at an EV/Adj. EBITDA of just under 20 and yields 4.7%. Equinix, with its 249 data centers supporting the cloud, trades at an EV/Adj. EBITDA of just under 22 and yields 2%. A back of the envelope calculation would suggest that if Applied Digital can execute on its $100 million annual EBITDA forecast once its three data centers are fully operational, it is currently trading at a forecasted EV/Adj. EBITDA significantly under 4. This busted IPO appears worthy of a small ' watch item ' holding with several caveats. First, despite its talk of diversification, Applied Digital has massive exposure to crypto miners with effectively all of its top line generated from this sector. Second, its 200MW facility in Texas is being powered by a wind farm, which can be an intermittent or, as was the case of during the winter of 2022, non-existent energy source. Although supported by battery storage, this setup merits scrutiny. That said, this is a stable business model in an otherwise uncertain industry.
