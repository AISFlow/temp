The project has enjoyed much attention from the bulls, gaining over 14% in just one week. Polygon, currently ranking 11th based on market cap, has had a busy week. The PolygonDAO has been closing deals and partnerships to expand the project&apos;s reach. This might be a major determinant of its more than 14% increase.

42373685,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUcqP,1665095217,BNB Chain Halts After 'Potential Exploit' Drained Estimated $100M in Crypto,"BNB Chain was forced to hit the brakes on Thursday after the blockchain with ties to the world's largest crypto exchange by volume suffered what it called a ""potential exploit"" that on-chain evidence suggested could have targeted hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto.  BNB Chain is composed of BNB Beacon Chain and BNB Smart Chain (BSC).  ""Due to irregular activity we're temporarily pausing BSC,"" BNB Chain tweeted from its official account, later confirming that the activity was a ""potential exploit"" that it characterized as contained.  Initial token movements suggested that up to 2 million BSC tokens, worth roughly $570 million, were targeted by an attacker late Thursday, but Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao estimated in a tweet the attacker was only able to get away with $100 million of that. BNB Chain also tweeted that $7 million of that amount was already frozen.  That such a small (comparatively speaking) sum of assets were stolen underscored the upside of BNB's gamble to halt the chain rather than risk more assets escaping. Blockchains are purportedly decentralized beasts designed to operate beyond the whim of singular entities. You aren't supposed to just flip an off switch.  BSC confirmed that it coordinated a shutdown of the chain after spotting issues with the BSC Token Hub protocol, the clearinghouse for crypto transactions moving between the Binance-linked blockchain's interlocking parts. It thanked validators for moving quickly.  ""We are humbled by the speed and collaboration from the community to freeze funds,"" one tweet read.  The chain has since come back online since then and BNB Chain announced that it will hold a series of on-chain governance votes that will decide whether the hacked funds should be frozen. There will also be a vote on a bug bounty reward system to prevent future hacks from happening.  The specter of an attack rocked BSC's native BNB token, which after a sleepy day of trading dipped to $280.40 from $293.10, according to CoinMarketCap, which Binance owns.  On-chain data shows that this afternoon two massive withdrawals of 1 million BSC tokens from BSC token hub by an attacker that nabbed crypto assets with cross-chains swaps, bridges, and borrows. Regardless, BNB's Twitter promised ""all funds are safe"" and said it will ""help freeze any transfers.""  Twitter sleuths point out that Tether – the largest stablecoin provider – has blacklisted the offending address, suggesting that the firm suspects the movement of tokens was the result of an attack rather than something more benign.

42373688,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUcp9,1665091190,Bitcoin’s Correlation With Gold Hits Highest Level in Over a Year,"Bitcoin’s reduced tendency to move in tandem with U.S. stocks has refocused analysts on a correlation that’s suddenly strengthening: the cryptocurrency’s connection to gold.  The two assets’ merging paths follow a recent trend, branching away from stock prices, which have sunk dramatically this year, and buttressing arguments by bitcoin evangelists that so-called digital gold offers the same safe-haven advantages as the real stuff. But the correlation remains only mildly strong, leaving open the question whether BTC and gold will continue to travel in sync.  “We could be seeing a slight decoupling of crypto and equity markets, which is reflected in BTC's rising correlation with gold,” said Clara Medalie, head of research at crypto research group Kaiko.  Bitcoin was recently trading just above $20,000, a nearly 3% gain over the past seven days, while gold was changing hands at $1,700, up more than 3% during the same period.  Last week, the 30-day correlation between the two assets reached over 0.3, its highest in over a year, even as cryptocurrencies decoupled from equities, according to Kaiko. The 30-day correlation between gold and bitcoin has ranged between positive and negative 0.2 since late last year.  A reading of 0.3 generally indicates a slightly positive correlation and 0.5 is moderately strong, while negative numbers indicate weak correlations.  To be sure, bitcoin has fallen far more steeply than gold this year. Russia’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine and the economic fallout in late winter through much of the spring also swept up bitcoin in an angst-induced sell-off in riskier markets like crypto, Medalie said.  But the decoupling waned with time as investors looked for solid ground immune to this year’s wider economic volatility. Bitcoin advocates have long maintained that the asset could serve as a financial hedge in times of economic turmoil – likening it to gold, which investors have historically esteemed for its ability to hold value.  “At this stage, investors are no longer X-raying the advantages of one hedge against inflation against another, but rather, they just want a better alternative to keep their funds at a time when fiat has proven to be more unstable,” Alexander Meurer, co-founder of blockchain-based fitness application Fitburn, told CoinDesk.  BTC and stocks  Kaiko noted that crypto markets performed better than traditional assets in the third quarter, particularly bitcoin, which fell about a percentage point during this period while the S&P 500 dropped 5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and Nasdaq plummeted 6% and 4%, respectively.  Kaiko’s Medalie said it’s still “too early to tell” whether the current BTC/gold correlation will strengthen or weaken over time, and linked the current weak positive correlation to bitcoin’s low volatility. BTC has been trading in a narrow $19,000-$22,000 band for much of the past two months, a symptom of the caution that has colored investors’ strategies as the world wrestles with high inflation, central bank hawkishness and the threat of recession.  Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree Asset Management, said he would expect the correlation between gold and bitcoin to remain “higher than usual” as the U.S. dollar strengthens amid tightening monetary policy.  “The dollar hasn’t been this pricey (on purchasing power parities valuation) since 1985, and at some point the Fed will cool off,” he said. “When that happens, both bitcoin and gold will respond well. Just as a strong dollar caused them pain, a weak dollar will bring relief.”  Morris said he would expect that “by mid-2023, or perhaps sooner, the dollar is no longer the story,” and gold and bitcoin will return to having a low or negative correlation.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/06/bitcoins-correlation-with-gold-hits-highest-level-in-over-a-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/12bef7e54404e47b1b145962ec14f3e79344bd7e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373690,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUcrf,1665089414,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Trades Flat for a Second Consecutive Day, but Outpaces Traditional Markets","Price Action  Bitcoin traded slightly higher on Thursday and most cryptocurrencies spent much of the day in positive territory.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, rose by 0.32%.  The top gaining crypto assets on the day were sushi (SUSHI), up 15% and vulcan forged PYR (PYR) up 12.15%. The laggards were numeraire (NMR) and celsius (CEL), down 12.3% and 7.8%, respectively.  Bitcoin (BTC) was still trading above $20,000, roughly flat from 24 hours earlier, as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization continues to trade in a tight range. BTC tested highs of $20,440, before retreating to current levels. Bitcoin dominance, a measure of the BTC’s market cap relative to the market cap for all cryptocurrencies, has increased to 41% since hitting a 2022 bottom of 39% on Sept 10. The uptick in BTC dominance highlights a shift in overall investment in cryptocurrencies, to bitcoin.  Ether’s (ETH) price rose by 1% on Thursday, on moderate volume when compared to its 20 day moving average for volume. ETH touched a low of $1,349, before advancing to its current level. ETH’s price currently sits between its 10- and 20-day moving average and has moved within 6% of its 50-day moving average.  Economic Reports: Initial U.S. jobless claims of about 219,000 for September were nearly 8% heavier than the consensus expectation of 203,000.  Continuing claims also rose. The 1.36 million in continuing jobless claims was more than five times higher than the consensus estimate of 203,000.  Thursday’s initial jobless claims data serves as a precursor to Friday’s important Non-Farm Payrolls and unemployment data release. The current consensus is the U.S. unemployment rate has held steady at 3.7%.  Friday’s jobs data is part and parcel to the macroeconomic narrative that has driven both traditional and digital asset prices. Markets still appear to be in a “bad news = good news” environment. Increased job losses typically signal that the economy is slowing and that inflation will likely decline.  A better-than-expected jobs report could lead to expectations that economic growth needs to be slowed, thus putting downward pressure on bitcoin prices.  U.S. Equities: Traditional stocks declined across the board as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 fell 1.2%, 0.7% and 1.02%, respectively.  Bitcoin’s correlation coefficient relative to traditional indexes has weakened from 0.90 to 0.27, a close to 70% decline. The correlation coefficient measures the price relationship between assets, with 1 representing a direct relationship, and -1 implying an inverse relationship. Ranges between -0.30 to 0.30, are considered neutral, and indicate a weak if not nonexistent relationship.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  Bitcoin still trading flat, but glimmers of hope appear  By most technical indicators, BTC should continue its pattern of trading in a tight range.  While BTC’s flat price movement is likely frustrating in the aggregate, it has been outpacing traditional finance indexes over the past month. Where the DJIA, S&P 500 and Nasdaq have fallen approximately 5% since Sept. 1, BTC has declined 0.32%  On a technical basis, Bitcoin’s 10-day exponential moving average is about to cross its 20-day, which signals a pinch of short-term strength. BTC’s current price has also surpassed its 50-day moving average of $20,313.  Overall volume has fallen below average in all but one of the last seven trading days. Trading volume often indicates conviction behind an asset’s move in price. Currently, BTC is neither moving much in price or trading in significant volumes, so it is providing scant opportunity for significant gains at the moment.  BTC’s price is also nearing the top of its Bollinger Bands, which historically serve as a signal that the price will revert to its average.  A difference between today’s breach and prior breaches is the lack of volume that accompanies it. Where in past breaches prices have reverted on higher-than-average volume, trading activity has declined in this instance. While not a clarion call for higher prices, this trend supports a narrative that selling pressure is beginning to wane.  Potential bullishness is present In derivatives markets as well, as the call/put ratio for BTC options sits at 1.85. A purchased call represents the option but not the obligation to purchase an asset at a predetermined “strike price.”  A purchased put represents the option (but not the obligation), to sell an asset. When the call/put ratio for an asset exceeds 1.0, it can indicate increased bullish sentiment.  A look at where strike prices are located shows that at $20,000, BTC’s price has entered an area of significant call buying activity. Moreover, the extent to which puts have been purchased has fallen significantly at the identical price point.

42373673,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUcYn,1665089404,Lido’s stETH Token Expands to Layer 2 Networks Optimism and Arbitrum,"Lido, the leading liquid staking system on Ethereum, said Thursday it will support a wrapped version of its popular staked ether (stETH) token to Ethereum layer 2 networks Arbitrum and Optimism.  Each stETH token represents an ether (ETH) token staked with Ethereum’s network, meaning it helps to secure the network in exchange for rewards. stETH, which has a market cap near $5 billion, trades around the price of ETH and has become an extremely popular asset in Ethereum’s budding decentralized finance (DeFi) scene.  Read more: Crypto Staking 101: What Is Staking?  Arbitrum and Optimism allow users to transact in the Ethereum ecosystem without falling prey to the network’s historically high fees and slow speeds. These so-called optimistic rollups process transactions on networks separate from Ethereum’s congested main chain, bundle those transactions up and pass them back to Ethereum where they are added to its ledger.  Over $3 billion worth of cryptocurrency was circulating on Arbirtrum and Optimism’s networks at press time according to DefiLlama. Now, users of these faster and cheaper Ethereum sister networks will have access to wrapped staked ETH (wstETH), a “wrapped” version of stETH that has been bridged over from Ethereum.  What is staked ether?  Ethereum, the largest blockchain network behind Bitcoin, moved last month to a new “proof-of-stake” system with a major upgrade dubbed “the Merge.” The new system ditched cryptocurrency mining in favor of staking, where users lock up ether (ETH), Ethereum's native token.  Today, staking ether means sending it to an address on the Ethereum network where it accrues rewards but cannot be withdrawn. Staked ether (stETH) will remain impossible to withdraw until a network upgrade – expected sometime next year.  Users wishing to participate in staking without losing liquidity have turned to liquid staking solutions like Lido, which take their ETH, stake it, and give them a stETH token in return. This token tends to trade around the price of ETH on the open market; it will eventually be exchangeable 1:1 for ETH once the network allows stakes to be withdrawn.  Exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken have replicated the Lido playbook but their staked ETH offerings are nowhere near as popular.  Nearly $1 billion stETH sits in liquidity pools on the major decentralized exchange platform Curve, and the asset is used widely by borrowers, lenders and traders who view it as a convenient way to easily stake Ethereum (and earn interest for doing so) without losing the ability to buy and sell their tokens.  Currently, Lido – which spreads user deposits between several different validator partners – holds around 29% of all staked ETH. Staked ETH represents control of Ethereum’s security apparatus, so the high concentration of stake with Lido has led to concerns around centralization.  Wrapping tokens, moreover, comes with risks. Bridge systems like the one being used to transfer stETH from Ethereum to Arbitrum and Optimism have, in the past, been the victim of major exploits, including a recent $190 million attack on the Nomad token bridge.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | ARB,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/06/lidos-steth-token-expands-to-layer-2-networks-optimism-and-arbitrum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d76a5059e4ea2c0598cd0183ff55682257e1f6d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Read more: Landmark International CBDC Test Deemed Success, BIS Says  According to the think tank, 105 countries representing over 95% of global GDP are exploring creating CBDCs. As the name suggests, CBDCs are digitally native, central bank-issued currencies that operate primarily via the use of blockchain technology.  Last week, a research project comprising an estimated 20 Asian-based commercial banks across four countries, successfully settled upwards of $22 million in foreign-exchange transactions, according to the Bank for International Settlements (IBS).  “We haven’t seen that before,” Lipsky said. “We’ve seen the technology tested. We’ve seen the hypothetical settlement, but we haven’t seen actual money in a serious amount flowing between countries.”  Read more: mBridge Reveals 15 Use Cases and 22 Heavyweight Participants  Lipsky said it represents “significant developments” in the world of CBDCs. The U.S., however, is still in the research phase, as are other notable players, including the U.K. and Mexico, according to Lipsky.  In the next two years, the U.S. could build a CBDC model that is “cyber secure, protects privacy and delivers near instant settlement,” Lipsky said, and could even be the “international standard setter,” prompting other countries to follow suit.  “We’re the dollar. We’re the issuer of the world reserve currency and other countries that are in a further state of CBDC development would say to themselves, ‘Well, we should probably be aligned with what the U.S. and what the ECB [European Central Bank] is doing,’” Lipsky said.

42373686,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUcnt,1665080834,Bitcoin Mining Is About to Get Tougher With Difficulty Primed for Another Sharp Rise,"Bitcoin miners are about to face another tough challenge in an already depressed market as the difficulty of mining a bitcoin (BTC) block is set to see another large increase early next week, weighing further on profit margins.  The metric adjusts automatically to keep the time required to mine a bitcoin block to roughly around 10 minutes, depending on the network hashrate, that is, amount of computing power committed to mine and secure the Bitcoin blockchain. The higher the hashrate, the higher the difficulty, which lowers miners' profitability.  The network’s hashrate is currently at all-time high, hovering just over 250 exahash per second (EH/s), according to data from analytics firm Glassnode. More efficient mining machines and cooler weather are among the reasons for this sharp increase in hashrate, said Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at mining services firm Luxor Technologies.  “A combination of high-efficiency machines such as the S19XP getting delivered, cooler temperatures heading out of summer, lower power costs in the U.S. and old ETH-mining power capacity being reallocated has led to a sharp increase in network hashrate,” he told CoinDesk.  Currently the bitcoin mining network block time is near 9 minutes, which is faster than the expected 10 minutes, according to data from CoinWarz. Although there is still more time left until the next adjustment, the difficulty is expected to rise more than 10% from 31.36 trillion today, potentially reaching an all-time high, data shows.  The measure has already seen a large increase in August as miners in North America started to ramp up production ahead of the cooler months. Earlier this summer, miners across the U.S. and in Texas, a hub for the industry, were curtailing their operations to cope with heatwaves, which contributed to lower difficulty and network hashrate.  Read more: Bitcoin Miners' Profitability May Narrow as Mining Difficulty Hits Second-Biggest Increase This Year  Margin squeeze for bitcoin miners  It's no secret that the bear market has been rough for the miners, who have seen profit margins shrink as bitcoin prices plunged more than 50% this year, while power prices soared and capital dried up. The shares of publicly traded bitcoin miners have fallen more than 70% this year, on average, according to FactSet data. Meanwhile, one of the largest bitcoin mining data centers, Compute North, filed for bankruptcy last month, citing the severe bear market, supply issues and trouble with its largest lender.  The pain is likely to be exacerbated for the industry from higher network hashrate and difficulty. “With hashprice hovering around the $80/PH/Day range, this difficulty increase will be painful for miners, dropping their revenue by an additional 10%+,” said Vera. The hashprice refers to a metric coined by Luxor that measures revenue per terahash of computing power for miners.  “If hashprice continues to decline, either through difficulty increases or falling bitcoin price, we will likely see some more distressed situations come to market in Q4,” Vera added, noting that miners with high debt load and costs are at most risk in this environment.  However, it's not all doom and gloom. With weaker miners squeezed out, the survivors are set to thrive, according to Chris Brendler, an analyst at Wall Street investment bank DA Davidson. “Miners with higher power costs, less efficient operations, and/or leverage have underperformed while the strongest positioned are set to thrive as the ""crypto winter"" is already squeezing out disadvantaged players,” said Brendler.  “Although cooler fall weather has recently sent the network hashrate to all-time highs, we're confident this spike is unsustainable without a materially higher BTC price,” he added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/06/bitcoin-mining-is-about-get-tougher-with-difficulty-primed-for-another-sharp-rise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2ac8641f3fe4060c566dae9075ab9bc14ebb66dd-893x670.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Mersinger, a commissioner on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Wednesday.  She was speaking in reference to a case the CFTC is handling that involves Ooki DAO, a lending platform that is governed by a community, and its predecessor company, bZeroX, and bZeroX's co-founders, Tom Bean and Kyle Kistner.  Read more: CFTC’s Ooki DAO Action Shatters Illusion of Regulator-Proof Protocol  On Sept. 22, the CFTC sued Ooki DAO for allegedly offering leverage and margin trading without registering with the agency or keeping a know-your-customer framework in place and simultaneously settled with bZeroX and its founders for allegedly engaging in the same practices.  Mersinger said the CFTC could have used a “public forum” instead of jumping straight to an enforcement action to discuss how to hold DAOs accountable.  “Before we do that, we need to have some notice to the public and encourage some public input,” Mersinger said. Earlier this week, the CFTC served a summons to Ooki DAO online with a help bot and on a forum post.  Read more: Court Rules CFTC Legally Served Ooki DAO Through Help Bot  It could be useful to have a regime in place that would essentially help DAOs register with the CFTC, Mersinger said. But at the present, “they wouldn’t fit within our framework,” she said, explaining the difficulty someone from Ooki DAO would have if he were to register with the agency.  “We [have] to change our framework and allow for registration,” Mersinger said.  More broadly, she said, Congress must set some rules on regulation.  ""Without more clarity in the laws without some sort of statutory change, we're going to continue to see any kind of regulatory-related regulatory framework on the federal level in digital assets coming out of enforcement decisions in court decisions,"" Mersinger said. ""Unfortunately, that bypasses kind of the public legislative process, the public input and it's not an ideal way to govern.  “We want to make sure we are holding people accountable,” Mersinger said. “The trouble here is we’ve got a novel area where it wasn’t a person or a few persons that were involved.  “When you go after the DAO, you don’t necessarily know who to hold accountable,” she added.

Terra&apos;s governance token LUNA, now Luna Classic (LUNC-USD), also fell by 99.9%. The Terra crash caused shockwaves in the crypto space.Early analysis of wallets on Terra pointed to a top wallet as one of the wallets whose actions pushed the price of Terra UST out of peg.

42411345,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNEdB,1665070193,​​Federal Preemption of State Money-Transmitter Licensing Would Be Great Policy,"Adelle Nazarian, CEO of the American Blockchain PAC, whose advisory board is led by W. Scott Stornetta, a physicist who was one of the inventors of blockchain technology, and Alex Allaire, co-founder and CEO of the American Blockchain Initiative, recently published a federal legislative road map in magazine National Interest’s Techland.  They compiled a list of 10 legislative proposals to protect investors without inhibiting innovation in the emerging blockchain sector. We are drilling down into the specifics of each of these at the National Interest here and there, at RealClearMarkets and now in this op-ed.  Ralph Benko is senior counselor to, and Todd White the founder of, the American Blockchain PAC.  One good way to protect the public without unduly burdening the blockchain sector would be to allow companies to elect to be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's digital commodity exchange regime. This was proposed by the Republican leader of the House Agriculture Committee, Rep. Glenn Thompson of Pennsylvania. By reducing compliance costs without diluting consumer protection, it would provide a major boost to innovation.  One of the balancing acts involved in good lawmaking is making a smart cost/benefit analysis. Everyone agrees that we must protect the public. That doesn’t mean we should station a physician at every intersection, which might save a few lives, but at an exorbitant cost.  Tech to the rescue! A stop sign or traffic light will do.  See also: Responding to the 26 Anti-Crypto Technologists | Opinion  The startup challenge  One of the greatest challenges for innovators is raising the seed capital to finance a startup. Typically, this goes through three stages: friends and family, angel investors, venture capital. Founders typically work insane hours and live at a subsistence level to make every dollar count. At the friends-and-families and angel levels, their seed capital would be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.  But filing for money transmitter licenses in all the states that require it would cost between $1 million and $1.5 million and would take up to two years, according to consulting firm Faisalkhan. That’s a deal killer, costing an order of magnitude (or more) greater than standard tech startup legal fees.  It’s preposterous. Bureaucracy runs amok, precluding innovation. These filings (and compliance costs) are wildly duplicative, an insane tangle of red tape. And to add injury to insult, this byzantine regulatory scheme has failed to deter many, many fraudsters.  The option of “one-stop shopping” at the highly competent CFTC, as proposed by Thompson, represents an act of statecraft. It is heartening to see a convergence between smart Republicans, like Thompson, and Democrats, like President Biden, who in his executive order on the responsible development of digital assets called for consumer protection and appropriate risk mitigation, stating the following:  “The United States has an interest in ensuring that it remains at the forefront of responsible development and design of digital assets and the technology that underpins new forms of payments and capital flows in the international financial system, particularly in setting standards that promote: democratic values; the rule of law; privacy; the protection of consumers, investors, and businesses; and interoperability with digital platforms, legacy architecture, and international payment systems.  The United States derives significant economic and national security benefits from the central role that the United States dollar and United States financial institutions and markets play in the global financial system. Continued United States leadership in the global financial system will sustain United States financial power and promote United States economic interests.”  See also: Does the US Government Have a Monopoly on Trust? | Opinion  In a release by the Republicans on the House Agriculture Committee, Thompson said the following:  “Because of its oversight of commodity markets, the House Agriculture Committee plays a critical role in the exciting future of digital commodities. We have an opportunity and a responsibility to be leaders in the digital assets space to protect consumers, foster innovation, and reduce regulatory burdens.  The Digital Commodity Exchange Act can tackle those challenges, and I'm asking for the feedback of stakeholders, regulators and my colleagues in Congress to ensure we advance the best possible framework as American innovators build the next generation of digital infrastructure.”  Bipartisan support  We now observe a grand conjunction of great policy between the White House and the House of Representatives, between the Democrats and the Republicans, between those who prioritize vigilant protection of consumers and those who champion keeping America at the forefront of technological innovation and its attendant prosperity.  We, along with our colleagues Nazarian and Allaire, consider Biden’s executive order the most important presidential policy statement on technology since President John F. Kennedy’s 1962 Rice University speech launching American astronauts to the moon.  The federal government will have an extraordinary opportunity to make America great again beginning in January, with the convening of the 118th Congress, by introducing an omnibus bill enacting the policies most conducive both to public protection and technological innovation. That legislation should include Thompson’s proposal to allow tech companies to elect a federal money-transmitter license that preempts redundant state regulation.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Todd White, Ralph Benko",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/06/federal-preemption-of-state-money-transmitter-licensing-would-be-great-policy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c865ae6d108cccb96044802a678409cd9ce3f5f-5908x3939.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Tuchman was central to the bank's exploration of digital assets in recent years.  The two departures reflect a trend of banking executives moving into the world of crypto. In June, three JPMorgan (JPM) executives departed to join crypto firms. The following month, Galaxy Digital appointed former Credit Suisse (CS) managing director Danielle Johnson to oversee sales and product strategy for institutional investors.

42394498,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw95yt,1665064144,Open Source: What It Is and Why It's Critical for Bitcoin and Crypto,"Open-source code is code that is posted publicly online. Anyone is free to use the code for their own purposes, scrutinize it for bugs or propose new changes or features. Open-source code is the backbone for Bitcoin, Ethereum and the systems behind many other cryptocurrencies.  The idea of “open source” long predates cryptocurrency. The phrase caught on in the 1990s to describe the phenomenon of people posting code publicly on the internet. Though you may not realize it, a lot of what people do on the internet hinges on open source code. For instance, at least 37% of websites that people visit rely on Linux, the open-source operating system.  Open source is an essential ingredient in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency realm, because like cryptocurrencies, open source is ""decentralized,"" meaning there's no single leader or entity in charge of it. Cryptocurrencies need a decentralized way of managing the codebase, where it's public for everyone to view, change and even try out for themselves.  Open source is the opposite of proprietary code, where a company owns the code and keeps it private to make sure others – especially competitors – can't copy their innovations. Proprietary code is centralized under the control of one company or entity. Windows and Apple’s mobile iOS are prime examples.  Why is open-source code necessary in cryptocurrency?  Bitcoin and most major cryptocurrencies are decentralized, meaning they don't have a leader that can stop certain transactions or control the network. Users who custody their own bitcoin have full control over it, unlike today's major online financial systems where the only option for people is to trust third parties, such as banks, with their money.  To achieve the goal of removing the middleman while maintaining trust, Bitcoin needs to rely on a decentralized method of distributing the code. There can't be just one leader ruling over it because A) the leader could write any instructions they want in the code, and B) the leader could decide who is allowed to access the code and who isn't.  Open source in Bitcoin is important for a number of reasons:  Anyone can run it: Because the code is public, anyone can download the Bitcoin software and run it for themselves – no permission from a company or government needed.  Verifiability: Outside developers can scan the software and verify that the code actually does what the project's developers say it does.  Security: Open source can lead to stronger security. Since more people can analyze the code than with proprietary code, openness can lead to more secure, battle-tested code.  Encourages project evolution: Anyone who's interested in adding their own features can propose adding them to the project. In Bitcoin, this is done through BIPS.  Allows efficient spin-offs: If the project's maintainers reject a developer's change for whatever reason, and the developer disagrees with this, the developer can ""fork"" (or create a copy of) the program code so that they can build their own project. Many cryptocurrencies modeled off of Bitcoin have done this, such as Litecoin.  Where is open source used in Bitcoin and Ethereum?  Open source is everywhere in the crypto universe, but let's focus on how the two biggest blockchains employ open source.  This trend of open code started when Bitcoin's pseudonymous and mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto released version 0.1 of the Bitcoin code – now known as Bitcoin Core – in open-source form on a cryptography mailing list on Jan. 8, 2009.  Since Nakamoto's release, Bitcoin Core has blossomed from a one-man project into a battle-tested codebase that developers from around the world contribute to full time. Because of the nature of open source, anyone who has the skills can contribute to the software. Since August 2009 more than 100 developers have contributed to Bitcoin Core, according to code hosting website GitHub, where the open-source code is published.  Hundreds of other open-source projects are built on top of this underlying infrastructure, from wallets like Electrum, where users store their Bitcoin private keys, to block explorers.  That's just the tip of the iceberg. Today there are hundreds of other projects with cryptocurrencies modeled off of Bitcoin, most of which also share their code publicly.  The second-largest blockchain, Ethereum, is made up of its own flourishing ecosystem of projects, from low-level clients underpinning the network to decentralized apps (commonly known as dapps) running on top of it. The ERC-721 token standard was created to support the unique structure of non-fungible tokens (NFT) that huge projects like the Bored Ape Yacht Club uses.  Read More: What Are EIP and ERC and How Are They Connected?  Ethereum's team is trying to take Bitcoin's goal to decentralize money one step further: It wants to decentralize everything on the Internet. Because most apps are controlled by one company, such as Twitter or Facebook, the goal of decentralized apps is to hand users more control of their data. So far hundreds of these apps have cropped up. Because they are all powered by open source, anyone can make their own app or contribute to one.  Crypto's deep-seated open-source nature has spawned thousands of projects, allowing widespread experimentation in the industry, and will continue fostering innovation and new technologies in the future.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/open-source-what-it-is-and-why-its-critical-for-bitcoin-and-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c076e0dd41d13514ee955601de8b5c3d9b43660-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Silvergate is one of the most asset-sensitive banks, but deposit outflows due to weaker crypto prices more than offset the benefits from higher interest rates, a Wells Fargo team of analysts led by Jared Shaw wrote.  The crypto bank's growth plans rely on a recovery in cryptocurrency markets or rapid stablecoin adoption, the note said, and its two main initiatives are the launch of stablecoin- and bitcoin-backed lending via its SEN Leverage platform.  The analysts said, however, that with stablecoin regulation taking longer than expected and little news on the bank's planned launch, that initiative may prove to be a “significant drag” on profitability in the medium term.  Upcoming quarters will be especially challenging for the stock as greater clarity is needed on the wider economy ahead of a crypto recovery, the analysts added.

During Q3, the miner&apos;s exit from its Hardin facility and scaling of operations at its King Mountain wind farm in Texas among other new locations has resulted in ~19K more miners coming online within the next 30 days, said Marathon CEO and Chairman Fred Thiel.

Marathon, which doesn’t own its mining facilities and uses third-party data centers to park its computers, also has paid about $50 million in operating deposits to Compute North, according to a statement on Thursday. Those deposits were mainly related to security deposits and prepayments associated with the operation of King Mountain and Wolf Hollow mining facilities in Texas, the company said.  Compute North filed for bankruptcy last month, citing the severe bear market, supply issues and trouble with its largest lender.

42411332,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNDwC,1665060300,Crypto Failures Fueled Better Due Diligence,"How do investors in traditional risk assets stay safe in rough markets? They flee to fundamentals, value, income or quality – some expression of factors that lead to a traditional security having less volatility and more advantageous returns in periods of turbulence and down markets.  But what should digital-asset investors do? The fundamentals of digital assets aren't as easily discerned, and it’s not always clear which cryptocurrency is going to be more or less volatile than its peers.  Recent events have caused participants in the crypto sector to not only recognize the value of due diligence, but also to revisit how they perform due diligence on digital assets, said panelists in the “Importance of Institutional Due Diligence for Digital Asset and Crypto Investors,” a Digital Asset Research webinar.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  “I’d be dishonest if I didn’t say the market looked a little beaten up,” said Marc Nichols, partner and product director at Arbor Digital, a digital asset manager that targets registered investment advisors.  “It’s beaten up for a good reason. We’ve had some bad actors, some players in the space who weren’t acting with good intentions, and we saw that with what happened to Three Arrows Capital and what happened behind the scenes with the Luna protocol network,"" Nichols said.  The collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital created a cascade effect where investors suddenly heightened their scrutiny of cryptocurrencies and decentralized-finance projects and began to abandon the ones where developers and sponsors weren't acting in good faith or where there was no clear value being added or issue being solved, according to Nichols.  Nichols said that reports from the executive order signed by President Joe Biden in March are being released and the wealth-management industry is finally gleaning some regulatory clarity around the digital-assets market.  NFTs and too much leverage  Doug Schwenk, CEO of Digital Assets Research, noted that in times of exuberance, investors often abandon the risk-management tools they once embraced in choppier markets, leaving them prone to drawdowns.  Nichols echoed Schwenk’s remarks, saying that all the signs of underlying vulnerability were present but that people weren't paying attention.  “We saw that in the space with people who were thought to be trusted players,” Nichols said. “Three Arrows Capital was a darling of the hedge fund space ... though we saw things happening that were cause for question, a lot of people chose to ignore them. So if you did due diligence and took a responsible approach, you could have seen the issues bubbling up – but because prices were going up, people wanted in.”  Read more: An Advisor’s Guide to Altcoin Investing  In a particularly obvious sign of market froth, the zeal for digital assets spread to the NFT market. As noise around the NFT sector increased in 2021, one non-fungible token sold for $69 million.  And then, last fall, the rally was over. After peaking at close to $69,000, the price of bitcoin (BTC) fell by more than 67% over a period of several months. Altcoin prices followed suit, often exceeding bitcoin’s losses.  The collapse wasn’t caused by macro issues, according Nichols, but by overleverage by investors like Three Arrows Capital. Digital brokerages were offering too much leverage to traders and investors, and firms like Three Arrows took on too much debt and counterparty risk.  “It wasn’t decentralized finance or the technology that actually broke. It was just human behavior and taking actions that they probably knew were a little outside the spectrum,” Nichols said. “With prices going up and dollars flooding into the space, it’s hard not to have the human reaction that we need to try to grow this exponentially.”  2021’s biggest crypto downfalls  Luna was an experiment that used rich incentives to bootstrap the growth of its underlying network – including promises of fixed yields in the neighborhood of 20%.  But Luna’s failure was one of “economic theory gone awry,” Nichols said. While due diligence showed weakness in the Luna network, asset prices soared and investors bought into the hype. “It’s the same thing we’ve seen play out in traditional markets for hundreds of years,” he said.  Read more: The Fall of Terra: A Timeline of the Meteoric Rise and Crash of UST and LUNA  Another spectacular collapse in the last 12 months involved the staked ethereum trade, where big investors took large positions in staked ethereum and then leveraged other positions on top of those positions.  Many of those investors failed to account for the volatility of cryptocurrencies and didn't employ risk-management techniques to deal with a steep decline in ether's (ETH) price, according to Nichols.  Tools for due diligence  Nichols uses Digital Asset Research to get clean, real-time pricing and asset data on cryptocurrencies and to vet digital assets on the strength and growth of their underlying network.  Arbor Digital, Nichols’ firm, identifies opportunities based on the network effect – the idea that the more valid, active participants a network has, the more powerful and valuable that network becomes.  “It’s almost like you have to throw away your old thinking, like the value and growth metrics and thinking you used to gauge the health of a company,” Nichols said. “We work closely with DAR to discern what that means, because the standards for what that means have not been built yet.”",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/06/crypto-failures-fueled-better-due-diligence,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f137ec1d9c1a0c7a63ee9ccb09f7c2524ad85f5-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) remained at the $20,000 level on Thursday as U.S. stock futures traded down, suggesting U.S. markets could stumble for a second day in a row after a two-day winning streak. The dollar eased slightly after posting solid gains overnight.  Bitcoin has been trading in a $600 range over the last few days, bouncing above and below the $20,000 mark with little direction.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, gained 1% over the last 24 hours. Other altcoins posting gains included Uniswap’s UNI, up 4%, and XRP, up 3%. Ethereum classic and Chainlink's LINK also made small gains.  In the news, crypto lender Celsius Network’s top three executives withdrew $56.1 million in cryptocurrency between May and June, shortly before the company suspended withdrawals and filed for bankruptcy, new court records show.  Former CEO Alex Mashinsky, former Chief Strategy Officer Daniel Leon and Chief Technology Officer Nuke Goldstein pulled bitcoin, ether, USDC and CEL holdings from their custody accounts in May before the company suspended all customer withdrawals.  In other news, GoldenTree Asset Management has invested $5.3 million in the Sushi governance token, the firm said in a Sushi forum announcement on Wednesday.  Finally, PowerTrade, a crypto exchange focused on derivatives, announced it is rolling out a request-for-quote (RFQ) model for the options market, which it says will cater to institutional investors by mirroring a widely used practice in traditional finance.

42373669,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUcWH,1665059624,Grayscale’s New Venture Aims to Capture Bear Market Opportunities in Bitcoin Mining,"Crypto asset management firm Grayscale is forming an investment vehicle that will help investors take advantage of the low prices of bitcoin mining infrastructures amid a continued crypto winter.  The private co-investment vehicle, Grayscale Digital Infrastructure Opportunities (GDIO), will partner with digital asset mining and staking infrastructure firm Foundry for its day-to-day operations, according to a statement. Grayscale and Foundry are both subsidiaries of Digital Currency Group (DCG), which is the parent company of CoinDesk.  The crypto winter has clearly been rough for the miners, who have seen profit margins shrink as bitcoin prices plunged more than 50% this year while power prices soared and capital dried up. This has directly hurt prices for infrastructures required for bitcoin mining, including the highly specialized computers, which were in high demand during last year’s bull run, driving up prices to all-time-highs, according to an index maintained by Luxor Technologies. Prices for the mining machines have since crashed near their 2020 lows this year and in some instances, even the largest manufacturers, such as Bitmain, are offering large discounts to sell their mining rigs.  Read more: Bear Market Could See Some Crypto Miners Turning to M&A for Survival  “Grayscale’s unique position at the center of the crypto ecosystem enables us to create offerings that allow investors to put capital to work through differing market cycles,” said Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein in the statement. “Our team has long been committed to lowering the barrier for investing in the crypto ecosystem – from direct digital asset exposure, to diversified thematic products, and now infrastructure through GDIO,” he added.  As the bear market is the perfect opportunity to build, some industry participants have taken the plunge to deploy capital into the struggling mining sector. “As part of Foundry’s mission to empower a decentralized infrastructure, we’re excited to partner with Grayscale to broaden the ability to invest in Bitcoin mining during this opportune time,"" said Foundry CEO Michael Colyer.  Last month, Crypto billionaire Jihan Wu – the founder of Bitmain – was reported to be setting up a $250 million fund to purchase distressed assets from mining firms. Meanwhile, decentralized finance (DeFi) firm Maple Finance said that it is starting a lending pool with $300 million capacity for mid-size bitcoin miners across North America and Australia.

The bearish price action comes even as major cryptos are on the rise, with bitcoin rising 0.9% to $20.2K and ethereum (ETH-USD) +2.7% to $1.36K at the time of writing. The company&apos;s Silvergate Exchange Network, the origin of its growth and profitability, is undergoing transaction volume reductions as crypto prices remain suppressed from huge drawdowns seen at the beginning of 2022, Shaw pointed out in a note to clients. Both bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ether (ETH-USD) are off over 70% from their November 2021 peaks.&apos;While SI is among the most asset-sensitive banks, balance sheet uncertainty from deposit outflows due to depressed crytpocurrency values more than offset the benefits from higher rates,&apos; the analyst wrote. As the uncertain crypto environment will likely keep Silvergate&apos;s (SI) balance sheet trends volatile, Shaw has slashed his 2023 EPS estimate to $4.93 from $9.21 in the prior view.

The funds will be come from its overcollateralized stablecoin, with 80% going toward U.S. short-term Treasurys and 20% to investment-grade corporate bonds. MakerDAO's community voted in favor of the allocation proposal, which was presented in late June.  Stablecoins and their collaterals have been the subject of debate since the implosion of the $40 billion Terra ecosystem and its stablecoin UST, which had ripple effects on the broader crypto market.  The move by Maker is aimed at diversifying its balance sheet into ""scalable legacy finance investments, limiting exposure to any one asset and expanding revenue streams"" and will be initiated by decentralized-finance (DeFi) asset adviser Monetalis.  In a separate announcement, digital asset bank Sygnum said it is the lead partner in the $500 million diversification effort.  Maker said that it has complete a $1 million transaction with the remaining investments to follow. Signum said it is working with BlackRock Switzerland to allocate $250 million in the first phase of the plan.

The news was first reported by CoinDesk last week.  The bloc introduced an eighth set of economic and political measures against Russia after the invasion of Ukraine in February, tightening a previous rule that limited crypto payments to European wallets to 10,000 euros ($9,900).  “The existing prohibitions on crypto assets have been tightened by banning all crypto-asset wallets, accounts, or custody services, irrespective of the amount of the wallet,” the European Commission said in a statement on Thursday, after proposals it made last week were signed off by EU governments.  The measures, which notably seek to cap the price of oil that Russia can sell, follow the country's attempt to annex the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.  Read more: EU Set to Ban Russian Crypto Payments After ‘Sham’ Referenda  The crypto clampdown, which took effect later Thursday after appearing in the EU’s official journal, forbids services being offered by European crypto providers to Russian residents and entities, unless they live in the bloc.  It appears to be motivated by fears that the existing 10,000 euro cap was not doing enough to curb payments from Russia, CoinDesk has learned.  “We realized that transactions were still going on on some scale” even after measures were imposed in April, an EU official said. “We wanted to make sure that these services are not rendered any more” by EU operators.  But the plans may rely on copycat measures from other European jurisdictions, added the official, who was not authorized to speak on the record.  “Switzerland in particular has been following all our [sanctions] measures in the past,” the official said. “We count that this is going to happen here as well.”  UPDATE (Thursday, Oct. 6, 2022, 14:50 UTC): Adds publication in official journal, comments from EU official.",NEGATIVE,없음,COMMODITY | TRADING,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/06/eus-russian-crypto-ban-confirmed-as-bloc-tightens-sanctions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea8365a550c72bfb5e96692b7f13baa28fb9eec7-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Proof Of Stake: Why Their Differences Matter,"SummaryDistributed ledger networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano are open for anyone to join and have no overarching authoritative figure.PoS chains derive their security from within the network, meaning the staked tokens used to secure the network are registered to the network and are visible to all participants.It is important to note that the PoW&apos;s bad-for-the-environment stigma might not be justified.The consensus method is arguably the most crucial building block of distributed ledger networks because it defines how individuals reach agreement in a global and permissionless system. A key component of consensus is the Sybil resistance mechanism, as it protects the network against attacks. Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are the biggest Sybil resistance mechanisms.While they serve the same purpose, PoW and PoS have significant differences in design that dictate a network&apos;s throughput, security characteristics, level of decentralization and energy consumption. In this report, we break down why a PoW network might be more challenging to attack than a PoS network, but also why PoS offers higher scalability, adequate security, and potentially a more compelling economic model.Key Takeaways Coordination of distributed ledger network participants and ensuring confidence in network security falls to consensus mechanisms, where majority rules.

42416106,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuZNHD,1665046127,DeFi Platform Ribbon Finance's Unsecured Lending Product Sees Crypto Firms Folkvang and Wintermute Borrow Over $10M,"Unless you have been underwater for months, you have probably heard that adverse macroeconomic conditions have made crypto market participants risk averse.  However, the early activity in the Ethereum-based structured product firm Ribbon Finance's recently launched high-stakes lending product, Lend, suggests otherwise.  Ribbon's Lend, which went live on Monday, allows depositors to lend unsecured funds to institutional market makers of their choosing with high liquidity.  The protocol has seen users deposit 15 million USDC, the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin. Of that, more than 10 million USDC has been borrowed by Alameda-backed quant trading firm Folkvang Trading and market maker Wintermute, which recently lost $160 million in a hack.  ""We see that there is still demand in decentralized finance for high yields. Users are willing to move out the risk curve if the risk-reward makes sense,"" Julian Koh, co-founder and CEO of Ribbon, told CoinDesk. ""Undercollateralized lending to reputable institutional trading firms seems to fit that category well.""  At press time, the annualized percentage return for loaning out USDC to Folkvang and Wintermute was nearly 7%. That's significantly greater than the 0.5% available on top decentralized platforms like Aave and Compound.  Uncollateralized Aave  Ribbon describes Lend as ""an uncollateralized Aave, offering best of both traditional finance and decentralized finance.""  An institution can borrow USDC from AAVE at a much lower cost but at the expense of locking another cryptocurrency as collateral. In other words, the borrower stands to lose the liquidity of the collateral locked, which isn't the case with Ribbon's Lend.  Meanwhile, Lend users stand to make higher yields from unsecured lending to institutions that have been evaluated for their creditworthiness by Credora. Besides, lenders can exit their positions at any time, subject to availability of liquidity in the pool. According to Ribbon, most unsecured lending in decentralized finance (DeFi) is for the fixed term, meaning lenders cannot withdraw deposits until the loan maturity. DeFi is a term used to describe financial activities carried out on a blockchain without the help of intermediaries.  ""Borrowing through Ribbon is more capital efficient,"" Folkvang's Chief Investment Officer Jeff Anderson said. ""With the advent of Lend, Ribbon now offers a one-stop shop for the full DeFi product suite and we are proud to be pioneers on the platform.""  Ribbon recently launched a crypto options exchange Aevo, having pioneered the concept of decentralized options vault (DOV) in 2021. The DOVs have simplified options trading, whereby investors simply stake their assets in vaults which deploy those in yield-generating option strategies.  Ribbon's foray into unsecured lending perhaps indicates the sector, dominated by the likes of Maple Finance, Clearpool and TrueFi, is heating up. A recent Reuters report cited TrueFi putting the total value of the unsecured lending market at $25 billion. Further, a Reuters survey of 11 lenders showed willingness to continue with unsecured lending despite the broader market meltdown.",POSITIVE,AAVE | USDC,AAVE | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | USDC,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/06/defi-platform-ribbon-finances-unsecured-lending-product-sees-crypto-firms-folkvang-and-wintermute-borrow-over-10m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e9f0594bed997ea25235e351dfe9ec778796b5c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

ArDrive Mobile is a decentralized permanent storage app offering users an alternative to popular data storage apps and letting them permanently store their data with no size limit.  The mobile app will use the ArWeave storage network with a version for Apple's iOS expected to come soon, ArDrive founder Phil Mataras told CoinDesk.  Arweave is a blockchain-based decentralized file storage service, similar to Filecoin and Storj. Decentralized storage networks are looking to take a chunk out of the established data storage and server market, which is dominated by Amazon Web Services.  Initially, the primary users of the ArDrive Mobile are expected to be crypto-natives, as users will need Arweave's native token AR to pay for data upload, Mataras said. ArDrive has around 10,000 users with over 500 monthly active users, he added.  Credit card payment facility and cross-application support are a planned upgrade, Mataras said.  ArDrive, which raised $17.2 million earlier this year, does not foresee raising another round for at least the next six months, he noted.

42416111,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuZNRH,1665038996,Celsius’ Top Execs Cashed Out $17M in Crypto Before Bankruptcy,"CORRECTION (Oct. 6, 18:35 UTC): Corrects figures throughout based on documentation provided by CTO Nuke Goldstein’s lawyers, who showed that most of his apparent withdrawals were sent to other accounts at Celsius. Corrects range.  CORRECTION (Oct. 6, 12:18 UTC): Corrects figure in the headline and first paragraph to $42 million.  Crypto lender Celsius’ top executives withdrew a little over $17 million in cryptocurrency between May and June 2022, right before the company suspended withdrawals and filed for bankruptcy, new court records show.  According to a Statement of Financial Affairs filed late Wednesday, former CEO Alex Mashinsky and former CSO Daniel Leon withdrew the funds largely from custody accounts in the form of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), USDC (USDC) and CEL tokens (CEL).  Over a dozen other executives, including the company’s Chief Compliance Officer, Oren Blonstein, Chief Risk Officer Rodney Sunada-Wong and new CEO Chris Ferraro did not make any significant withdrawals during that time period, according to the document, one of several filed to the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.  Mashinsky withdrew about $10 million in cryptocurrency in May 2022. Leon withdrew about $7 million (and an additional $4 million worth of CEL denoted as “collateral”) between May 27 and May 31.  Initially, it appeared that current CTO Nuke Goldstein withdrew around $13 million (and an additional $7.8 million worth of CEL denoted “collateral”). However, matching transactions through different affiliated entities suggest that in reality, Goldstein moved his holdings to and from different accounts, all maintained with Celsius. The net amount he took out from his personal account is around $550,000, mostly in ETH. A related party of Goldstein, Bits of Sunshine LLC, withdrew a combined $5.7 million in CEL on May 9, 11, 13 and 25 from a custody account. The majority of these funds were likewise deposited into his personal account at Celsius, which he put up as collateral.  Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July after it halted all user withdrawals citing “extreme market conditions” a month before.  Wednesday’s documents are the latest development around the beleaguered crypto lender as its bankruptcy case heats up. An independent examiner, appointed by the U.S. Trustee’s office, is currently investigating why Celsius fell apart and how it managed and stored customer deposits.  Mashinsky and Leon resigned from the lender within the last two weeks. Earlier this week, the Financial Times reported that Mashinsky withdrew $10 million in crypto before Celsius froze withdrawals.

Bitcoin Trades Sideways Amid Disheartening Job Figures, Oil Cuts  By James Rubin  Just when prices seemed ready to lessen, new job numbers and a price-conscious OPEC damped investors' hopes.  After rising handsomely for two consecutive days, bitcoin flattened, although the largest cryptocurrency by market value remained comfortably above the psychologically important $20,000 perch it has held for much of the past week. BTC was recently trading at $20,300, up almost a half-percentage point over the past 24 hours.  Ether was recently also changing hands slightly higher from the previous day, same time, at $1,375. Other major cryptos were trading sideways and up, with XRP and LINK rising over 3% and 1.4%, respectively. The popular dog-themed meme coin DOGE recently was up about 1.5% after spending a good portion of the day in the red. Its moderate changes veered from the previous day, when DOGE soared more than 10% on news that one of its biggest champions, billionaire Elon Musk, would follow through on his original offer to purchase social media platform Twitter.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market, currently stands at 982.48, a -0.76% decrease from Tuesday.  Stocks  Equity indexes were similarly sluggish with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all declining a smidgen of a percentage point. Investors on a two-day high after encouragingly negative job and productivity data points suggested that inflation might significantly diminish, returned to the risk averse behaviors that have colored their investment strategies for much of the past year.  Earlier in the day, ADP’s Employment report on job creation in the private sector arrived hotter than expected as businesses created 208,000 jobs in September, versus consensus estimates for 200,000, and 12% higher than August's 185,000 total. And OPEC rocked energy markets by reducing oil production by two million barrels. Brent crude oil, a widely watched measure of energy markets, is now trading at nearly $94 a barrel less than a month after dipping to about $82, a 14% gain that could foreshadow additional increases and keep prices stubbornly high.  In an email, Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya said that the jobs report and the Institute for Supply Management (ISM)'s surprisingly resilient business services reading for September on Wednesday offered false hopes that inflation would moderate enough for the Federal Reserve to pivot from its recent diet of hawkish interest rate hikes.  ""Traders were quickly reminded that the economy isn’t falling off a cliff and that the Fed might have to remain aggressive with its rate hiking cycle next year,"" Moya wrote, adding that ""bitcoin’s fundamentals still support a healthy consolidation here and that should remain the case,"" short of the next unemployment figures on Friday and next week's Consumer Price Index arriving higher than anticipated.

Now that office is a shell of its former self as most of BitMEX’s staff have moved from Hong Kong to Singapore and further afield.  “Our biggest office is in Singapore,” Alexander Hoeptner, BitMEX’s CEO, told CoinDesk in an interview. “We love Hong Kong so much, [but] because of the COVID-19 situation I moved out and a lot of people moved out.”  At one time having an address at Cheung Kong Center symbolized that the exchange was a serious player in the financial sector. After all, it could count Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Bank of America and Bloomberg as its neighbors in the building.  Convincing the building’s owner, Li Ka-shing, that you were worthy of inclusion in this list was a sign that you made it.  “In the past half year, we’ve seen more digital currency or blockchain companies coming to look for spaces in Central,” John Siu, managing director of Cushman and Wakefield, told the SCMP at the time. “[Central] can polish the image of a company.”  But the pandemic changed all of that, as did Hong Kong’s deteriorating political status.  Now, crypto wants to be nimble and decentralized.  Hoeptner said BitMEX has generally switched to remote work as a lot of the exchange’s Hong Kong-based expatriate staff wanted to be closer to their families, from whom they had been separated for some time because of Hong Kong’s long quarantine requirements, which at one point hit 21 days.  BitMEX is the second large crypto company to shift its physical presence focus from Hong Kong due to the city’s Covid policies. Last September, FTX moved its headquarters to Nassau, The Bahamas, citing a friendlier regulatory environment and better COVID-19 policies.

Korea Says","The South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted a public notice on its website Wednesday announcing it would invalidate Terra creator Do Kwon's passport, advancing a move the government first said it was considering last month.  The government said the notice was being posted publicly due to an ""inability to deliver"" the passport return order. An attached PDF document added further detail, saying the move means Kwon might be rejected if he tries to apply for the reissuance of his passport.  ""Our Department would like to send a 'Notice of Order for Return of Passport' to you by registered mail,"" the notice said. ""... we inform you that the validity of your passports will be invalidated and administratively invalidated.""  Normally the invalidation of a passport would mean Kwon can no longer leave South Korea. If he is not currently in South Korea, he would likely find it difficult to travel elsewhere. Officials gave Kwon 14 days from the notice's issuance to return the passport.  The news comes shortly after South Korean prosecutors told local media outlets that they had ordered the freezing of nearly $40 million worth of crypto assets they said were tied to Kwon.  However, Kwon tweeted later that he did not use the exchanges in question and the funds were not his.  He continued a recent trend of tweeting statements at odds with what Korean officials have said. He said he could not find an Interpol ""Red Notice"" on the intergovernmental police agency's public website after prosecutors told reporters one had been issued and denied claims that he was ""on the run,"" despite an outstanding arrest warrant from South Korea and statements from officials in Singapore saying they could not locate him.  Terraform Labs, the Terra ecosystem token issuer, previously said in a statement that the arrest warrant was beyond the scope of prosecutors' authority, calling the investigation ""highly politicized"" and claiming it violated basic rights.  Terra, Kwon's brainchild, collapsed dramatically in May of this year, shedding close to $20 billion over the course of days.  Neither Kwon nor Terra immediately returned requests for comment.

The company, which has about $47 billion in assets under management, said it had been ""following Sushi for a while"" and with the start of its crypto-focused GoldenChain Asset Management arm, was ""psyched to be more active in all things Sushi.""  Sushi was created as a copy of Uniswap, with added liquidity mining and governance features. Although aiming to improve on the original, it has appeared to be falling behind competitors.  Still, GoldenTree said in its forum post that ""Sushi had incredible potential.""  SushiSwap's token SUSHI is up nearly 14% at $1.28 in the past 24-hours.  ""Although the community has certainly been through some tough challenges, we’ve been amazed at the resilience of both the core team and the community in the face of these speed bumps, as you all have continued to build and release top-tier products.""  The announcement came just three days after a leadership change. On Monday, Sushi community members elected Jared Grey as CEO, transferring power within the decentralized exchange after months of realignment and controversy surrounding the protocol’s governance.  The election followed a year of organizational difficulties at Sushi. In September 2021, the de facto CEO and founding member, pseudonymous 0xMaki, left for an external advising position. In December, Chief Technology Officer Joseph Delong departed to serve in the same role at NFT (non-fungible token) lending platform Astaria.  The firm has been ratcheting up its commitment to crypto for more than a year. In July 2021, the company added an undisclosed amount of bitcoin to its balance sheet, and earlier this year, it introduced its new digital investment strategy, including GoldenChain and a team of what it referred to as ""10 crypto natives"" the forum post.
