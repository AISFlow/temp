Back in 2021, bitcoin&apos;s deviation from expected market trends had sparked hope that it would break the September curse, but alas, it followed it to a T. This is why with the new month already ushered in, there are expectations that the price of BTC will continue to dive and likely reach lower trends as it enters the worst of the bear market. Analyst Says Brace For Impact One of those who have referred to the September curse in their analysis of the price of bitcoin is Scott Redler, the Chief Strategist at T3 Trading Group. Redler posted a bitcoin chart outlining the movement of the digital asset since last year, marking important technical points that had triggered a downtrend in its price. Related Reading: A Date For The Mt. Gox Repayment Is Set, How Will This Affect Bitcoin? An important level that has been mapped out by BTC lately is the $17,600. This represents the new local low after the cryptocurrency had set a new record and plunged below its previous cycle peak. Now, $17,600 has become the level for bulls to hold to avoid further decline. Redler&apos;s chart shows that if the digital asset fails to hold above this level, then the next support lies around $13,500. But even more interesting is the fact that below $13,500, the next possible point is at the dreaded $10,200.

Bitcoin Waffles Around $20K and Binance  By Bradley Keoun  Bitcoin (BTC) waffled around the $20,000 mark for the ninth straight day, with traditional markets mostly closed in the U.S. in observance of Labor Day.  As of press time the largest cryptocurrency by market value was changing hands around $19,800, down 0.7% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was up 1.7% to $1,598.  Crypto analysts were looking at a pattern in blockchain data known as ""dormant supply peaks,"" suggesting that bitcoin might be poised for a bull run. Another metric called the Puell Multiple indicates that long-term investors have been adding to their stashes as prices declined.  Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by volume, said it would move to stop supporting the stablecoins USDC, USDP and TUSD, with a plan to automatically convert users' holdings of those coins into its own stablecoin, BUSD, on Sept. 29.  Poolin, one of the largest bitcoin mining pools, suspended withdrawals as part of an effort to preserve assets and stabilize liquidity.  A Brazilian financial regulator barred the Singapore-based crypto exchange Bybit from brokering securities.

Now, with an end to Ethererum proof-of-work mining on the horizon thanks to the upcoming Merge and its shift to a proof-of-stake blockchain system, prices for GPUs are dropping like a rock.  A bull market for crypto has, in the recent past, come with a bull market for GPU prices. At the height of ether’s 2021 rally, some of the most powerful GPUs were retailing for an average of 114% over their manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP). After all, for proof-of-work-based protocols — what Ethereum uses currently, since its launch in 2015 — GPUs and their parallel processing ability have been essential for mining.  But that was before The Merge. Ethereum’s shift away from computationally intensive proof-of-work to proof-of-stake means that the tens of millions of GPUs purchased over the last four years to mine ether no longer have a use. Some miners are considering moving their operations to Ethereum Classic, but despite the protocol being around for nearly six years it just hasn’t garnered the network effect needed to allure a critical mass of decentralized apps, non-fungible tokens (NFT) or decentralized finance (DeFi).  GPU prices are reflecting this. According to published data from industry analyst house Jon Peddie, overall GPU unit shipments decreased by 15% from last quarter. Part of this comes from a softening PC market, with analysts at IDC forecasting a 12.8% year-over-year decline for 2022. The rapid quarter-over-quarter drop in GPU prices puts the blame squarely on evaporating demand from crypto miners.  According to GPUTracker.eu, prices for some of the most popular GPUs are down by double-digits. The RTX 3080 Ti, a once-favorite for miners, has seen its average selling price drop by 45% in the last quarter, putting it almost at MSRP. In February, the card was being sold for around $2,000; now it's just over $1,100.  In China, wholesalers can’t get rid of these cards fast enough as inventory piles up from mining farms trying to offload supply.  All this is being felt on Nvidia’s (NVDA) bottom line. During recent earnings, the company said its gaming line (read: GPUs that were being used for mining) was down 33% on the year to $2.04 billion – sharper than executives anticipated. Its dedicated crypto mining chip revenue also fell, but sales of these chips represent a small fraction of the silicon the company sold to miners.  In many ways, executives at Nvidia couldn’t be happier. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, never was too comfortable with miners pilfering what he thought should have been for gamers or other users of the chips.  “Gaming is growing, workstation is growing, AI hyperscale data center is growing, high-performance computing is growing. Quite frankly, I'd prefer that our GPUs were built to be used in those areas,"" he was quoted as saying at the company’s annual technology conference in 2018. ""My preference would be, of course, that we allocate them for the people we build them for, but there's a logical reason for why [miners use] Nvidia GPUs, because it's the world's largest distributed supercomputer.""  It looks like Huang and Nvidia will get their way. They just need the grit to deal with a few quarters of decline that comes just as the broader PC sector comes off its COVID-19 supercycle. The question is, will it recover as quickly without mining? Investors, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, would like to know.

42422426,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0kvfh,1662412786,Crypto Exchange Bybit Barred From Brokering Securities in Brazil,"This article is adapted from CoinDesk Brasil, a partnership between CoinDesk and InfoMoney, one of Brazil's leading financial news publications. Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  The Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) banned the Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Bybit from brokering securities.  In a declaratory act published on Monday, the CVM ordered the suspension of “the public offering of any securities intermediation services, directly or indirectly, including through the use of websites, applications or social networks” by Bybit to Brazilians.  According to the CVM, Bybit was “seeking to raise funds from investors residing in Brazil for investments in securities,” without the company having authorization to act as a securities intermediary. In Brazil, only Brazil’s stock exchange B3 can offer securities.  Bybit did not respond to a request for comment.  The CVM added that Bybit must comply with the ban immediately or else the commission will impose a daily fine of 1,000 Brazilian reals (equivalent to US$194).  In April, Bybit announced that it allowed Brazilian users to acquire cryptocurrencies using Brazilian reals and the launch of earning products and a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace.  In June, Bybit told CoinDesk InfoMoney that it was closely following the crypto regulatory debate in Brazil, in order to take the best possible approach and not repeat the case of Binance, which was suspended by the CVM in 2020.

Binance said on Monday that it will convert all investments in USDC, pax dollar (USDP) and trueUSD (TUSD) into BUSD on Sept. 29, and customers transferring those tokens to the exchange will see them automatically converted into Binance's stablecoin after that date. However, customers will be able to withdraw money denominated in USDC, USDP or TUSD when removing money from Binance.  The decision effectively banishes the second-largest stablecoin, USDC, from one of the most prominent perches in crypto, erecting an obstacle to overtaking tether (USDT) as the biggest one. USDT's $68 billion market value leads USDC's $52 billion, while BUSD is in third place at $19 billion. USDP and TUSD are far smaller.  Read more: What's the Point of Stablecoins? Understanding Why They Exist  The surprise move comes as Binance goes after another exchange rival, Coinbase (COIN), by undercutting it on price.  Stablecoins are part of the crypto market's foundation, serving as digital substitutes for the U.S. dollar or other fiat currencies. ""Stable"" comes from the fact that their price is pegged to a conventional currency or other type of asset such as gold. Each token tied to the dollar, for instance, is always supposed to fetch almost exactly $1, though the quality of the assets backing a stablecoin can influence how far the price strays.  The business is dominated by USDT's 44% market share.

Traditional markets in the U.S. were mostly closed in observance of the Labor Day holiday.  Market Moves: Could ether be set for a renewed price rally ahead of the Merge?  Chart of the Day: Bitcoin's recent consolidation around $20,000 has taken the shape of a symmetrical triangle.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) was trading flat on the day at around $19,700. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value hit lows of $19,400 over the weekend after witnessing a short uptick on Friday following the U.S. jobs report.  As BTC is trading below the crucial support level of $20,000, a significant break at this point could be really damaging, according to analyst Craig Erlam at Oanda.  “The following key level below here would be the June lows of around $17,500,” said Erlam in a morning markets note. “Considering the outlook for risk appetite in the near term, it's not looking good.”  Ether (ETH), which has performed slightly better than bitcoin over the last few weeks, was up 1% over the last 24 hours. The network’s much anticipated Merge is just over a week away. For altcoins, Polkadot's DOT was up 4% and Chainlink's LINK was up 3.7%.  In traditional markets, gas prices surged and the euro and pound slumped after Russia shut down gas flows through the main Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany. The decision has created more uncertainty in Europe going into the winter months. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 1.1%.

Last week, the native token of Ethereum's blockchain broke out of a falling wedge pattern identified by two converging and descending trendlines connecting Aug. 14 and Aug. 25 highs and lows hit on Aug. 10, Aug. 20 and Aug. 28.  ""The formation is solid confirmation that ETH could go up in September more than anybody thinks,"" Bill Noble, chief technical analyst at cryptocurrency research company Token Metrics, told CoinDesk, when asked what the wedge breakout indicates.  Ether's wedge breakout indicates the correction from the Aug. 14 high of $2,000 has ended and the uptrend from the June 13 low of $1,000 is likely to resume.  Prices doubled in the four weeks to Aug. 14 as equity markets regained poise and Ethereum developer Tim Beiko hinted at Sept. 19 as the deadline for the long-awaited Ethereum Merge – the technological upgrade that will transform the smart contract platform to a proof-of-stake network. The overhaul is likely to cause a drastic reduction in ETH supply and bring a store of value appeal to the cryptocurrency.  The Merge is slated to happen sometime around Sept. 15.  Traders often use technical analysis – a study of price patterns – to help make investment decisions.  The ""falling wedge"" pattern begins wide at the top and contracts as prices move lower, causing the two descending trend lines to converge as the pattern matures. The converging nature of trend lines represents shallower lows, a sign of decreasing selling pressure. Therefore, a breakout is taken to mean a bullish revival.  Ether exited the falling wedge on Thursday, setting the stage for a pre-Merge rally.  ""Ether has broken out of a falling wedge,"" Lewis Harland, a researcher at Decentral Park Capital, said. ""A move above $1,700 would add conviction in the bullish momentum heading into the Merge.""  Read the full story here.  Chart of the Day  Bitcoin Forms a Symmetrical Triangle  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin's recent consolidation around $20,000 has taken the shape of a symmetrical triangle.  The next move depends on the direction in which the ongoing bull-bear tug of war is resolved.  A breakdown would open the doors to lows under $18,000 reached in June.

42422429,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0kvlh,1662384877,"Parabolic Bitcoin Bull Run Likely After Dormant Coin Supply Peaks, Past Data Suggests","The view that bitcoin's (BTC) fate is closely tied to what the U.S. Federal Reserve does has been widely discussed. As a result, most traders looking to time the next parabolic bull run are waiting for the world's most powerful central bank to declare victory over inflation and abandon liquidity tightening.  While the Fed decisions are undoubtedly important, indicators unrelated to macroeconomic factors and unique to the crypto market, like coin dormancy metrics, could be equally valuable in timing the next bull run.  ""Dormant supply peaks are springboards for upwards price action,"" Nik Bhatia, author of the best-selling book ""Layered Money,"" and market analyst Joe Consorti wrote in the latest edition of The Bitcoin Layer newsletter.  Bhatia concluded that after noting bitcoin's tendency to chalk out sharp multi-month rallies after the percent of circulating supply inactive for at least a year has peaked.  As seen in the featured image, the percentage of supply that was inactive for at least a year topped in January 2016 and the peak preceded a major 21-month bull run that saw prices rise from $450 to $20,000 – a staggering 4,340% rally.  Similarly, bitcoin went berserk after the metric peaked in the third quarter of 2020, rallying from $10,000 to over $60,000 in six months to April 2021.  At press time, the percentage of bitcoin dormant for at least a year stood at a record 65.76%, according to data sourced from blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.  If history is a guide, bitcoin may see another meteoric rally once the metric has peaked.  ""If two-thirds of bitcoin is off the market (not for sale) for an extremely long period of time, the price is driven up when more buyers enter the market bidding for a finite supply – a scenario that has played out in bitcoin twice before,"" Bhatia noted, adding that there are more unspent one-year plus old coins than ever before.  On-chain data has its own set of limitations and the metric in consideration doesn't take into account fast-growing bitcoin-linked trading vehicles such as derivatives, tokenized bitcoin, exchange-traded funds, exchange-traded products and trusts. Coins locked in these alternative vehicles are still liquid or active, even if they don't appear to be in on-chain metrics.  Nevertheless, the relationship between inactive supply and price trends is noteworthy.  ""Is this causal or circumstantial? We don’t know. But when data moves in inverse-tandem in previous cycles, it catches our eye and demands attention,"" Bhatia said.  Bitcoin changed hands at $19,750 at press time, down 0.5% on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk data.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/05/parabolic-bitcoin-bull-run-likely-after-dormant-coin-supply-peaks-past-data-suggests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b90d5ec6173ba70cff0a7d665e5134dd9fa39dfe-1800x1013.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

An audit of an unidentified company by BDO was criticized by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the accountancy and auditing watchdog.  The ""financial services provider"" under audit was identified as Revolut by people familiar with the matter, the FT said.  The audit was conducted with an ""inadequate"" approach to revenue recognition, meaning the ""the risk of an undetected material misstatement was unacceptably high."" The FRC also had concerns over how BDO tested payment processes.  Crypto trading accounts for up to 10% of Revolut's annual revenue, which was 261 million British pounds ($300 million) in 2020.  Its application to be licensed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) remains unresolved, with the firm able to offer crypto services through the FCA's Temporary Registration Regime.  Revolut had not responded to CoinDesk's request for comment at press time. BDO declined to comment.

Truss secured 81,326 votes, while Sunak got 60,399.  The Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs will be replacing Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who announced he would quit in early July after he lost the support of his government. Truss and Sunak were both gunning for Johnson’s position as the leader of the Conservative Party, and consequently as prime minister.  Truss will be formally appointed on Tuesday after Johnson officially announces his resignation to Queen Elizabeth II.  Truss’s campaign promised a plan to drive economic growth and “put Britain back on track” following its exit from the European Union. In 2020, the year that Brexit was finalized, Truss – who was trade minister at the time – said she believed the country could “create great opportunities in areas such as blockchain.”  “We should welcome #cryptocurrencies in a way that doesn't constrain their potential,” Truss said in a 2018 tweet. At the time, she was chief secretary to the Treasury.  Despite these two statements, Truss has not said much about crypto or blockchain, and has made no concrete policy proposals on these issues. It’s also unclear if Truss will support or continue Sunak’s plans to turn the U.K. into a crypto hub.  Before Sunak resigned as finance minister he, along with the former economic secretary to the Treasury, John Glen, paved the way for a new Financial Services and Markets bill that could bring payments-focused crypto like stablecoins into the scope of regulation. The bill is meant to ""cut red tape"" and free up the financial sector for growth following Brexit.  Truss has previously said that as PM she would support a controversial plan in the bill that would give lawmakers the power to step in when they feel regulators are holding back post-Brexit reforms.

42422431,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0kvrh,1662377712,Citi: Ether Extends Rally Ahead of the Merge Despite Bitcoin Weakness,"Ether (ETH) has outperformed bitcoin (BTC) in recent months, likely in anticipation of the planned Merge upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain, Citi (C) said in a research report Friday.  The Merge, or the switch from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, is the first of five enhancements planned for the blockchain, and is expected to happen later this month.  Ether has gained 43% since the “post-LUNA crunch” in mid-June, while its main competitors have lagged, with BTC declining 1.4% over the same period, the report said.  The bank observed that ETH gained following previous upgrades, but not relative to bitcoin. While it has outperformed recently, it is hard to say how much of the Merge is priced in, Citi said.  The most comparable event was the launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020, a “defining moment for the transition to PoS,” where ETH posted strong gains, the note said.  Citi notes that while there have only been three similar events in bitcoin’s history, there has been a tendency to rise in the ensuing 50 days. While BTC “halving” events only halve block rewards and – as a result – net issuance, ETH issuance is expected to decline by as much as 89%.  Read more: The Final Countdown to the Ethereum Merge Has Officially Begun  ETH September futures have moved into backwardation, a situation that occurs when the spot price of an asset is higher than the future’s, in expectation of an ETH PoW airdrop, the report said. That could occur if Ethereum forks into a PoW blockchain in addition to the PoS one, because holders on the Merge date would be eligible to receive a new token.  The futures market is now at a $20 discount to spot after having traded at a premium until the start of June. Perpetual future funding rates have also turned increasingly negative as users sell short the perpetuals and buy spot ETH in order to be eligible for any potential airdrop, the report said.  The bank cautions that while historical events can be a useful indicator for the future, they only offer a broad guide with a wide range of outcomes, and there are important differences between previous upgrades and now, as “for the first time in their history, digital assets are facing tightening financial conditions.”  With a large amount of ETH already having been staked, increasing from 10 million in March to 13 million currently – or about 11% of total supply – “a successful [M]erge is a critical technical step to support the future of ETH scaling,” the note said.  A decline in on-chain activity is a sign of slowing demand, but ultimately “crypto-network utility will be determined largely by growth in usage, which should be more consequential than the merge itself,” the note added.

The Puell Multiple, a tool that measures one-year revenue growth among bitcoin miners, indicates there's buying interest among investors and, with a reading of 0.5, places bitcoin in a so-called green zone for those looking to build long-term exposure to the coin, CryptoQuant analysts told CoinDesk. The metric entered the green zone in the last leg of the previous bear market, which preceded weeks of price consolidation and a subsequent revival, as reported.  The Puell Multiple, calculated by dividing the daily issuance of bitcoins in U.S. dollar terms by the 365-day average of the value, indicates that newly minted coins are undervalued relative to the yearly average. For some observers, this shows that the current profitability for miners to sell bitcoin is relatively low – a move that has previously marked price bottoms.  The CryptoQuant analysts, however, cautioned that a price bottom is probably “still far” from being formed, citing fundamental concerns.  “The macro environment is not supporting the bitcoin price as USA economic data is still coming worst than expected,” they said. “Economic activity is decelerating faster than expected.”  The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to continue raising interest rates aggressively, with some officials stating it is “unrealistic to expect easing anytime soon” – a sentiment that has added to concerns among investors.  Market analysts from crypto exchange Bitfinex said in a Monday note that bitcoin and ether (ETH) are currently experiencing growth in the number of addresses holding the two cryptocurrencies.  The balance of holders has reached a record 12.92 million bitcoin and more than 60% of all bitcoin is stored by addresses that have had those spot positions for more than a year, the analysts said. The number of addresses holding between one and 10 bitcoin is about 750,000 and rising, they added.  “This persistent accumulation of bitcoin throughout bear markets demonstrates the numerous holders' strong commitment to and long-term belief in cryptocurrency,” Bitfinex’s analysts concluded.

Users have been complaining about issues with withdrawals from their wallets since at least August, according to messages on official Poolin Telegram support channels.  In a post on his WeChat Moments on Sunday, akin to a Facebook newsfeed, Poolin CEO and founder Kevin Pan acknowledged that the company is lacking liquidity, but said user assets are safe. Pan wrote that the company's net worth is still positive and that there will soon be a plan as to how to deal with the issues, according to a screenshot of the post. The plan might involve taking on debt backed by equity or machines, he wrote.  Around the same time, a message posted to the pool's Chinese Telegram account, sought to reassure customers and dispel rumors of a rug pull. The mining pool and wallet operate independently and long waiting times for withdrawals are due to risk management, the post said, cautioning users not to listen to rumors of rug pull.  Prior to the Sunday announcements, customer service representatives on Telegram would usually tell users to wait and try to address individual complaints regarding withdrawal delays.  Today, one customer representative said that the company is ""facing some financial issues"" that has made withdrawals more difficult. Asked when to expect funds, the customer service representative said: ""It's hard to name a specific date.

Prices doubled in the four weeks to Aug. 14 as equity markets regained poise and Ethereum developer Tim Beiko hinted at Sept. 19 as the deadline for the long-awaited Ethereum Merge – the technological upgrade that will transform the smart contract platform to a proof-of-stake network. The overhaul is likely to cause a drastic reduction in ETH supply and bring a store of value appeal to the cryptocurrency.  The Merge is slated to happen sometime around Sept. 15.  Read more: The Final Countdown to the Ethereum Merge Has Officially Begun  Traders often use technical analysis – a study of price patterns – to help make investment decisions.  The falling wedge begins wide at the top and contracts as prices move lower, causing the two descending trendlines to converge as the pattern matures. The converging nature of trend lines represents shallower lows, a sign of decreasing selling pressure. Therefore, a breakout is taken to mean a bullish revival.  Ether exited the falling wedge on Thursday, setting the stage for a pre-Merge rally.  ""Ether has broken out of a falling wedge. A move above $1,700 would add conviction in the bullish momentum heading into the Merge,"" Lewis Harland, a researcher at Decentral Park Capital, said.  Gazprom plays spoilsport  The cryptocurrency appeared on track to cross $1,700 on Friday after a supposed ""Goldilocks"" U.S. nonfarm payrolls report revived hopes for slower Federal Reserve rate hikes after September.  However, the ascent stalled after Russian energy giant Gazprom scrapped a Saturday deadline to resume gas supply to Europe via the Nord Steam 1 pipeline, citing a technical fault.  The news bolstered inflation fears, zapping investor risk appetite. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, energy supply disruptions in Europe and other parts of the world have worsened, leading to sticky inflation. That has forced global central banks to suck out liquidity with rapid interest rate hikes and other tools.  According to Politico, Gazprom said on Saturday it would increase its shipments of gas to Europe via Ukraine. However, markets seemed skeptical that would help and remained weak at press time, with major European equity futures trading 2% lower while the dollar index topping 110.00 for the first in two decades.  Ether traded flat at around $1,565 while bitcoin was priced at $19,765, according to CoinDesk data.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/05/ether-primed-for-pre-merge-rally-after-wedge-breakout,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dcda26cf52f9d65f931637d5e7b9f73a14c4113d-1197x898.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It has benefitted from the success of the gaming industry, which has managed to remain recession-proof even through the worst of economic crises. This industry continued to pull in billions of dollars when companies in other sectors were going bankrupt by the day, and this ability to bring in a steady stream of money seemed to have spilled over into the P2E space. That is, until the bull market was over and crypto was staring down the barrel of the bear market. Since the market decline, P2E tokens have taken the most hit. This has spilled over to NFTs, and their trading volume took a nosedive. As a result, earnings from NFTs are now lower than they had been in previous months. Thus arose the need for an alternative way to earn from NFTs, without being wholly reliant on speculative markets. Blockchain game Cradles is one that has come forward with a new system that allows investors to earn from NFTs without having to hold it themselves. Staking NFTs For Gameplay NFT staking is no longer a new concept in the blockchain gaming industry. Various games in the space have adopted an NFT staking system to allow players to earn passive income from their NFTs. This not only provides earnings to the holders, but it also helps to ensure the value of the NFTs remains high by reducing the number of them being traded in the o...",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cradles-new-sin-system-allows-you-to-earn-by-staking-into-nfts-of-elite-players/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/2265280.jpeg

But here&apos;s why you consider a spike in buying pressure. Bitcoin (BTC) currently trades above the $19750 threshold and had previously challenged the $19500 weekly support level. The possibility of a bullish reversal is increased by the daily candle&apos;s extended tail-rejection, which is related to its falling volume. Can the possible bull run reclaim the $20,600 level? Key Points: The BTC price trend maintains a declining trend. The bullish RSI divergence projects a bullish breakout hope. The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $28.16 billion, indicating an insignificant rise of 17.45%. Source - TradingView BTC Technical Analysis Earlier this week, Bitcoin attempted to bounce higher but fell short of the nearest resistance level of $20750. As a result, the coin price has settled into a tight range between $20750 and $19500. Furthermore, the failed attempt mentioned above slumped the BTC price back to the $19500 mark. On the other hand, the declining volume during this bearish reversal indicates that the seller&apos;s hand is diminishing as we approach the lower support. A bullish reversal could push prices up by 10.5 or 14.5% to the $21900 or $22600 resistance levels.

A negative reversal to test the buyers at the $1427 horizontal zone is more likely as the Ethereum (ETH) price struggles close to the $1600 resistance level. Additionally, a rising bearish pattern on the daily chart foreshadows a significant corrective phase in the coming days.

The coin over the last 24 hours has barely depicted any movement. In the last week, Bitcoin price fell by 1.7%. Overall, the king coin has been consolidating at this price mark over the last week now. The technical outlook of Bitcoin has remained negative as the charts have not been favouring bulls. Broader market weakness has been prevailing for almost a few months now. Sellers have become more active in the past week.

42373889,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvW9e5,1662339600,"LG Shuns Ethereum, Picks Hedera for Television NFTs","Another consumer electronics company is taking NFTs to TV screens.  Korea-based LG is releasing a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace called LG Art Lab that plugs into the Hedera Network, which LG supports. Television owners with sets updated to LG’s most recent software will be able to buy, sell and showcase their Hedera NFTs from their screens.  LG’s strides into the NFT space follow Samsung’s release of an NFT marketplace on three of its TVs, all supported by Nifty Gateway. LG Art Lab will only be on LG TVs. Incorporating LG's mobile crypto wallet Wallypto, users can purchase assets by scanning a QR code to connect their wallets.  Chris Jo, senior vice president and head of Platform Business at LG, told CoinDesk in an email the platform aims to make NFTs accessible for users looking to step into the space.  The choice of Hedera is not an obvious one for an NFT integration. The platform NFT trading scene is not nearly as popular as on better-known blockchains such as Ethereum, where most so-called ""blue chips"" live. (Hedera uses a different technology called hashgraph).  Ethereum's top NFT marketplace OpenSea has processed $333 million in NFT trades in the past 30 days, according to DappRadar. By contrast, one of the leading NFT marketplaces on Hedera, called Zuse, has processed $1.22 million in trades over the same period.  Still, Hedera makes more sense for LG: It has been on Hedera’s Governing Council since 2020.  Shayne Higdon, CEO of the HBAR Foundation, an organization supporting developers on the Hedera network, told CoinDesk Hedera’s energy-efficient consensus mechanism makes it an ideal blockchain for cheap, low-carbon-footprint NFT transfers. Still, other networks are catching up; market leader Ethereum is moving to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake system this month.

Bitcoin's Quiet Weekend Below $20K  By James Rubin  Bitcoin camped out below $20,000 on the last three-day summer holiday weekend in the U.S.  The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently trading at about $19,900, up a few ticks of a percentage point over the past 24 hours and about where it ended Friday. BTC has held support at roughly this level for a week as investors eyed employment data that could give them some hint about the U.S. central bank's next interest rate intentions later this month and wisdom of committing to higher risk assets.  ""We continue to see bitcoin struggling to maintain $20,000 support,"" Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  DiPasquale called bitcoin's current range ""good ... to begin accumulation,"" although he advised ""being mindful of further drops"" that might occur around Sept. 13, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the August Consumer Price Index (CPI).  Ether maintained a similar level of crypto price stasis with a little more than half the U.S. Labor Day weekend over. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently changing hands just below $1,600, up approximately 1% over the previous day but just about where it ended Friday. ETH investors now await the Bellatrix upgrade on Tuesday. This enhancement on the Beacon Chain will be responsible for setting the rest of the Merge process in motion. The Merge will shift the Ethereum blockchain from proof-of-work to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake protocol.  Other altcoins were mostly in the green with ADA, ATOM and SHIB all recently up over 4% over the previous 24 hours. The native token for GMX, a decentralized exchange on Arbitrum, rose more than 9% and has climbed significantly in recent weeks.  Stocks  U.S. equity markets closed down on Friday after the Labor Department's latest jobs data offered little hope that the Federal Reserve, which has boosted interest rates a hefty 75 basis points at its last two Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, would ratchet back its hawkishness. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all dropped more than a percentage point and have fallen three consecutive weeks. U.S. markets will be closed on Monday.  The Institute for Supply Management will release its monthly services index on Tuesday with expectations for a slight decline. The U.S. Census Bureau will publish its wholesale inventories report for July.  Crypto news  On Saturday, MicroStrategy (MSTR) Executive Chairman Michael Saylor told an audience at the Baltic Honeybadger conference in Riga, Latvia that the non-crypto part of the software firm is working on bitcoin-related projects as well. The firm's developers are working on solutions that would allow the onboarding large numbers of people onto the Lightning network, a payment network on top of bitcoin allowing faster and cheaper transactions.  CoinDesk's Jocelyn Yang reported, unusual blockchain data appears to show large blocks of bitcoin worth more than $200 million moving for the first time in years, prompting crypto analysts to puzzle over its significance. On Aug. 28, according to a post from crypto data analysis platform CryptoQuant, 5,000 BTC that hadn’t moved for at least seven years was transacted. The next day, LookIntoBitcoin’s data tracker showed another 5,000 BTC was transferred again.  The saga of troubled crypto lender Celsius Network continued when the company, which is going through bankruptcy proceedings, said in a legal filing Thursday that a freshly found $70 million pile of cash would likely help it continue operating through the end of 2022. According to the document, Celsius expects “approximately $70 million of proceeds from the repayment of USD-denominated loans.”  BitBull's DiPasquale remains wary about predicting any long-term, crypto price movement upward. ""If the current macro economic conditions persist, we may see a prolonged consolidation period for crypto and markets in general, as opposed to a sharp upward recovery,"" he wrote.

So What  By Sam Reynolds  Robinhood (HOOD) recently announced that it’s listing Cardano's ADA token on its trading platform, which has generated all kinds of buzz and bullish predictions about a price breakout.  Of course, talk about ADA and price breakouts sometimes seems as old as crypto itself: The token, according to its faithful, is always on the precipice of something great.  But the reality is a breakout has yet to happen. ADA, despite being launched in 2017, only introduced smart contracts last year. Smart contracts are what make blockchains useful; the maturity of smart contract framework on Ethereum can be directly tied to the value of Ether.  And even after smart contracts were launched on Cardano, nothing happened. DeFi Llama shows that the total value locked (TVL) in Cardano is only $81 million. Compared to the TVL locked in other protocols this is smaller than a rounding error (or in the case of Solana, a double-counting scheme).  In the time since Cardano’s launch, other protocols have far surpassed it for utility and for the market’s faith in them. Klaytn, which is relatively unknown outside South Korea, launched in late 2021 and has a TVL of $357 million. Avalanche, launched in September 2020, has $1.8 billion in TVL.  Even if Tron, which is synonymous with s**tcoin, and whose founder’s name is closely associated with a get-rich-quick scheme, has a TVL of $5.7 billion – way more than Cardano.  Market cap is a measure of the value of tokens in circulation, not in the value locked in the protocol’s code.  To be sure, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson seems to always draw a crowd wherever he goes, and this charisma and his past accomplishments (some falsified as journalist Laura Shin recounts in her recent book) may largely explain the protocol’s allure and $15 billion market cap. Investors are often drawn to entrepreneurs with great presence.  Based on Cardano’s current merits, nothing else accounts for its attraction.
