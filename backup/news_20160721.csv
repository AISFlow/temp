42426963,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyDfh,1469144287,Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme Operator Sentenced to 18 Months in Prison,"The first federal securities fraud case involving a bitcoin investment scheme has ended with perpetrator Trendon Shavers receiving a sentence of 18 months in prison.  In addition, Shavers was assessed penalties including three years of supervised release, a $100 special assessment, $1.2m in forfeiture and $1.2m in restitution.  The decision puts to rest a case that began in July 2013 when Shavers was charged with defrauding investors through an investment service called Bitcoin Savings and Trust (BCS&T), which was later deemed to be a fraudulent ponzi scheme.  Shavers, who was charged with one count of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud, faced up to 40 years in prison. He pled not guilty to fraud charges in March 2015, a decision he would later reverse in September of that year as part of a plea deal that lowered his possible sentence to a maximum of 41 months.  In statements, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said the case was an example of how new technology can be used to perpetrate activities that are already illegal under existing law.  Bharara said:  ""Applying a modern spin to an age-old fraud, Trendon Shavers used a bitcoin business to run a classic Ponzi scheme. Shavers raised money in the form of bitcoins by promising spectacular returns and personal guarantees, when all he was really doing was paying back old investors with new investors’ bitcoins.""  According to Reuters, Shavers was apologetic in court, stating that he ""royally messed up"".  ""I don't think this is something I'm ever going to get over,"" he said, according to the report.  Shavers was fined $40.7m in a related civil lawsuit in September of 2014. He was later arrested in November of that year. Prosecutors now project 48 of the scheme's approximately 100 investors lost all or part of investments.  New York prosecutors report Shavers fraudulently obtained approximately 146,000 BTC as a result of the scheme, a figure worth $807,380 based on the average price of bitcoin during the scheme and worth $97m at press time.

42426975,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyE9h,1469142098,Why Big Bank Consultants Were Watching Ethereum's Hard Fork,"The impact of the recent ethereum hard fork is extending far beyond message boards and forums, serving as a learning lesson even for firms actively engaged in building private blockchains.  Representatives from major consulting firms are reporting that they are receiving questions from enterprise clients about ethereum's decision to execute a hard fork of its blockchain. Companies as diverse as Capgemini, Deloitte and Ernst & Young indicate that their blockchain specialists have been observing as well, as part of an effort to keep an eye on the fast-developing open-source blockchain sector.  ""This is definitely a set of developments that we’ve all been watching very closely,"" Iliana Oris Valiente, a lead blockchain strategist at Deloitte, said in an interview today.  While she said she believes such a situation may not be replicable in a private blockchain environment (given the incentives structures and design specificities at play), she said there are lessons to be learned for the wider community.  Valiente told CoinDesk:  ""Our clients are certainly asking questions, especially the ones that are more involved in a hands-on type of basis. They’re asking, ‘How does the DAO impact projects we have ongoing?’ ‘Should that reduce our confidence in ethereum?’”  Ernst & Young blockchain lead Angus Champion de Crespigny, however, said clients are more curious than concerned.  He reported to a persisting overall skepticism in public blockchains from clients, but said that notable public blockchain projects are serving as a basis point for experiments with the technology.  “Things that are happening in the public blockchain space are being watched with interest rather than with fear,"" he said.  Overall, there was broad agreement that the demise of The DAO and the subsequent hard fork to rescue investor funds were a reminder of how nascent the blockchain ecosystem remains, and how regulatory oversight and consumer protections will need to be addressed in this new environment.  Champion de Crespigny likened it to a ""teething process"" for the industry, and a sign its innovators are perhaps keen to push the technology too fast, too quickly.  ""To start a social media network in 1995, the tech wasn’t there, and the bandwidth for all the things in social media and mobile weren’t there either. You need the scaffolding to build the building,"" Champion de Crespigny said, adding:  ""I think it is a matter of tempering enthusiasm.""  Research needed  Also prevalent was the perception that the incident is an example of why more research is a requisite for the entire blockchain ecosystem.  Capgemini blockchain community lead Bart Cant, for example, said the situation demonstrated that more ""tools and capabilities"" are needed to deal with disaster situations that occur.  ""Disaster recovery plans and procedures are absolutely critical and required for deploy in financial services industry solutions,"" Cant said. ""It was evident from the DAO hack and its aftermath that very little was in place or tested beforehand on ethereum.""  Champion de Crespigny notably said that the event should serve as a ""wake-up call"" to innovators in the industry, one that brings with it questions about how blockchains should be used, and how solutions built on these platforms should be architected.  For example, he noted how, at seven years old, bitcoin has proven that blockchains can be used for transaction executions. More complex contracts and agreements, he said, simply aren’t at that stage despite the institutional interest.  ""It raises the question, 'Are we overcomplicating things in this industry?'"" he said.  Coin Sciences CEO Gideon Greenspan, whose startup firm consults enterprise clients on projects and proofs-of-concept, also voiced a desire to see blockchain projects conducted on a smaller scale.  ""From our perspective, it supports our long-running view that smart contracts should be avoided in blockchains unless they are necessary for a particular use case,"" Greenspan said.  Security and exploration  All respondents, however, were quick to assert that their firms are still committed to researching and understanding the blockchain industry, and that the hard fork would provide valuable data to help improve community understanding.  ""I would say this situation has given us another vector from a security standpoint that we can add to the projects that we’re working on and improve from it,"" Valiente said.  Champion de Crespigny noted that he believes that the event provides evidence that investors should be wary when engaging in the public blockchain ecosystem, noting the double-edged sword of these speculative investments.  “I think The DAO was a very exciting project with a lot of risks… It could have had a big payoff or a big loss,” he continued.  However, he said that ambitious projects, and perhaps ambitious failures, are necessary should the wider industry want to develop blockchain to its full potential.  He concluded:  ""I think those experiments are good and people need to keep on doing it.""

42426979,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyE3h,1469132387,Bitcoin's 'Nervous System' Gets an Upgrade With FIBRE Network,"A long-running effort to move data for bitcoin's transaction blocks around the world more efficiently has received an upgrade.  Since bitcoin was released, an array of services or solutions have emerged to meet the needs of those using the digital currency. These include exchanges that allow bitcoin to be bought and sold for government-issued currencies; mining pools, which grew as miners sought to collectivize for greater profit; and new kinds of wallets that delivered better functionality and security.  But, some of the needs of the distributed network are not readily apparent to observers.  As Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell puts it, the Bitcoin Relay Network, the brainchild of fellow Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo, arose several years ago in response to a need to propagate bitcoin block data more quickly among miners, or those who process its transactions.  ""A couple years ago as blocks started getting above 250k regularly we saw what looked like a rapid consolidation of miners towards the most popular pools. One of the reasons was smaller pools were experiencing high orphaning,"" Maxwell recalls.  He told CoinDesk:  ""It seemed like we were rapidly on a trend where only a single pool would exist.""  However, he said Corallo sprung into action, developing the original relay network and delivering what Maxwell called ""radically improved block propagation speed"".  The Bitcoin Relay Network ultimately materialized as a network of nodes positioned in China, Europe, North America, Russia and Southeast Asia. Each of the nodes sports a robust internet connection, and in theory acts as a railroad for block data. The data is compressed and then transmitted via the Transmission Control Protocol, or TCP.  That system has been described as bitcoin's vascular or nervous system – a critical component to delivering information throughout the body. Now, an enhanced successor has been released.  Enter FIBRE  Corallo recently unveiled the Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine (FIBRE), an effort aimed at building a more capable version to the Bitcoin Relay Network.  The idea is that, by improving the speed at which this information is conveyed, miners can reduce the amount of orphan blocks, or transaction blocks that are rejected by the network in favor of another created around that time.  Corallo, who operated the original network and designed the new version, said that the initiative also helped increase the cost of selfish mining and cut down on the amount of empty blocks generated through SPV mining.  But according to Corallo, the existing relay network began to ""show its age"" in the last year, prompting work on the new software in the past several months.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Over the past few years of running it and very carefully benchmarking it, I've found that you just can't get the kind of reliable low-latency relay you want when using TCP in any form. A few months ago I finally got around to starting from scratch to build a new fast-relay protocol, building Compact Blocks as the foundation and early versions of FIBRE at the same time.""  At issue, Corallo explained, was that the network that functioned via TCP was susceptible to data loss, which would require additional processing (and thus increasing the time it takes to relay blocks). He explained in his blog post introducing FIBRE that, with TCP, data packets can get lost along the way.  ""Only then will the sender retransmit the lost packets, allowing the receiver to (potentially) reconstruct the original transmission,"" he wrote.  These extra round-trip times ultimately caused spikes in relay time on the original Relay Network, he explained.  FIBRE's upgrade  To sidestep this problem of latency – the time in which it takes packets of data from one point to another (in this case, from node to node), Corallo said he turned to another protocol, the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).  ""Instead of using TCP to send the data required to transmit a block once and relying on full round-trips to detect and resend lost packets, FIBRE sends the data using UDP with additional Forward Error Correction (FEC) data (ie data which allows you to reconstruct the full transmitted data even though some was lost),"" he told CoinDesk.  It’s this latter element, FEC, that Maxwell referred to as ""a bit of technology magic"".  FIBRE's makeup also involves BIP 152, a proposal for ""compact blocks"" aimed at cutting down the amount of bandwidth used when block data moves from node to node.  ""This way, even if some parts are lost, the block is still received very quickly and without back and forth communication,"" Maxwell explained. ""It also retains its speed even if the block doesn't look very much like the receivers mempool.""  Network effects  Yet for all the enhancements, FIBRE’s most ambitious aim is, perhaps, an effort to get people around the world to run more networks.  Originally, the network was maintained under the auspices of Corallo himself, meaning that its operation – as with any bitcoin node – was contingent on his ability to maintain it.  Despite its code being freely available, Corallo said that there wasn’t much of an appetite to stand up additional networks. Ultimately, the success of a network (or system of networks) is arguably dependent on getting more people to actually run them.  FIBRE seeks to change this dynamic. The software is designed to function as an add-on to Bitcoin Core, offering an avenue for more people to come into contact with the code and potentially launch their own relay networks.  According to Corallo, work is underway to encourage other parties to create their own FIBRE-based relay networks – an effort he said is needed to keep things decentralized.  Corallo has also published a guide for setting up FIBRE networks.  In the meantime, he said new groups are now interested in setting up relay systems, and he is, for now, cautiously optimistic more users will help the cause.  He continued:  ""I'm not sure if I should mention them by name yet, but I'm confident at least two or so will stand something up and make it publicly available soonish.""

42426973,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyE1h,1469117880,Coinbase Wallet Users Can Now Buy and Sell Ether,"Coinbase has added support for ether, the digital currency that powers the ethereum blockchain.  The announcement comes just two months after the startup, which has raised $117m to date, added ether trading to its bitcoin exchange service, at which time it also formally rebranded the platform, Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX).  With the news, Coinbase users can now buy or sell ether from an ethereum wallet on their accounts, as well as its Coinbase Buy Widget, announced in June. Users can also buy and sell ether using all of Coinbase's available payment methods, including credit card and bank transfer, and at the same limits as bitcoin purchases.  In its full blog post announcing the news, Coinbase further addressed the recent controversies on the ethereum platform.  This included the June demise of The DAO, a project whose failure forced a community decision that found developers altering the platform’s code in an effort to recover the funds.  Here, Coinbase defended the ethereum platform, stating that it is still in an ""early and experimental"" phase, and that it expects ether to be used for different purposes than bitcoin.  The company wrote:  ""Ethereum is pushing the digital currency ecosystem forward and we are excited to support it as part of our mission to create an open financial system for the world.""  The comments echo statements from Coinbase's major executives, who have been vocal in their praise for ethereum's development community and vision.

42399161,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiVdz,1469111103,"After Rising 1,000%, Uncertainty Clouds Ether's Price Projections","The price of ether, the native token on the ethereum platform, rose modestly yesterday, climbing nearly 5% after its developers executed a hard fork to restore funds from a defunct project once heralded as its greatest success story.  While the full ramifications of the actions taken to rescue investors have arguably yet to be seen, the decision puts to rest weeks of uncertainty in the wider ethereum community that could be seen in its markets. In recent weeks, the demise of the The DAO has stalled ether's rapid price growth, halting its meteoric rise of more than 1,000% in Q1.  As for where the price of ether goes from here, market experts were largely split in their predictions.  Most emphasized that while both ether and Ethereum face significant uncertainty in the short-term, the so-called ""DAO hack"" could prove beneficial in the long-term.  Max Boonen, founder of market maker B2C2, was one observer who predicted the market would immediately benefit from the fork, but that this would soon give way to larger questions about ether's value.  Boonen told CoinDesk:  ""Reductions in uncertainty always lead to a relief rally. In the short run, the question here is whether the relief rally is over.""  Widespread uncertainty  Overall, a majority of market observers spoke to the uncertainty that ether faces moving forward from the hack. Most noted that the digital currency has only been trading since 2015, making its market less mature than bitcoin's, which has (arguably) existed since the first block was mined in January 2009.  Petar Zivkovksi, director of operations for bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, went so far as to predict ether will now enter a ""period of great uncertainty"" following the fork.  ""I expect some volatility but we're also dealing with a crypto market that is 'tired' of massive swings, so those may be subdued,"" he said.  He also spoke to potential headwinds, emphasizing that high volumes have put a sell pressure on the market.  Investor and entrepreneur Vinny Lingham also commented on the price fluctuations ether will likely experience in the short-term.  Lingham, whose new startup Civic uses blockchain tech, went so far as to predict bitcoin could benefit from uncertainty in the ether markets as money exits for safer waters.  ""Some volatility is to be expected,"" he told CoinDesk. ""A non-material amount of Ether holders will swap ETH for BTC, driving up BTC prices temporarily and causing a flash crash in ETH.""  Immutability question  One of the more active conversations to emerge from the hard fork is the debate over whether ""immutability"" is a defining characteristic of a blockchain, and therefore a quality that is necessary to support the value of its token.  Of note is that many in the bitcoin community have criticized the hard fork as one that shows ethereum's blockchain can be changed, undermining the platform's ability to lay claim to this attribute.  However, when asked, most market observers chose to position the hard fork as a sign of ""progress"" in the ethereum community, emphasizing that this challenging event could prove beneficial in the long run.  Chris Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead for investment manager ARK Invest, addressed the question of immutability by stating he believes ether's market is developing differently than bitcoin's.  ""Ethereum has a different value proposition than bitcoin, notably the flexibility of its scripting language and the way which the state of the network is maintained. The DAO hack and remediation has proven ethereum's flexibility in both regards,"" he said.  Boonen also weighed in on this question, taking aim at so-called 'bitcoin maximalists' by stating that he believes immutability to be an overstated feature of the bitcoin blockchain.  ""Bitcoin's blockchain can be altered too, and it has. People misconstrue public blockchains. They are nothing more than what miners decide to mine and what nodes decide to validate. If enough people agree to, they can alter a blockchain in any way they want,"" he said.  Others, including former Deutsche bank trader and BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, see the event as creating a precedent that could perhaps undermine the value of ether.  For example, Hayes went so far as to envision a situation whereby a government regulator could pressure developers to shut down a popular ethereum service through a similar change to its code.  ""This incident clearly demonstrates that the Ethereum Foundation has some modicum of control over the Ethereum network. Whether or not the case is successful is irrelevant, the Foundation could be in court for years spending millions of dollars that could be used to further develop the protocol,"" he said.  Possible headwinds  Others see ether facing additional resistance going forward.  Algorithmic trader Jacob Eliosoff spoke to the future prospects of the ethereum platform, which is built to support projects like The DAO, emphasizing that it remains to be seen whether other developers will succeed where its contributors failed.  ""It may take a few weeks for people to be comfortable that the DAO nightmare is over, and meanwhile there is risk of further exploits,"" he said.  Eliosoff indicated that traders may be looking to see if the difficulties The DAO's developers faced in using ethereum's solidity smart contracting language will hold back adoption or lead to other project failures. Still, he was largely optimistic, despite concerns.  “Assuming no major bugs, I would expect the ETH price to resume its upward trend since the start of the year, at least as long as developers and entrepreneurs maintain their fast progress,"" he told CoinDesk.  Burniske also provided some bullish remarks, thought he included the caveat that this depends on whether developers are able to continue to launch successful projects on ethereum.  ""Over the coming months the community can get back to ‘creation’ as opposed to ‘remediation and maintenance,’ which should continue to move demand for ether up and to the right,"" he said.  Going forward, only time will tell how quickly the ethereum community will move forward from this event. However, should the software platform progress as much as bitcoin has over the last seven years, ether prices may hold significant upside potential.
