42376504,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AqLd,1370887273,Feathercoin hit by massive attack,"Feathercoin, the new Scrypt-based coin based on Litecoin, suffered a widespread attack over the weekend, leaving its founder scrabbling for fixes.  The method for the assault was a 51-percent attack, which occurs when someone gains enough hash rate to create his or her own blockchain. This gives the attacker the ability to bring the authority of the original blockchain into question, and creates ""orphan"" blocks in that blockchain.  It was the latest in a series of attacks against the coin, said Peter Bushnell, the UK-based founder of the altcurrency – but this one was different.  “I saw this not long after the attack started two days ago,” he said. “It was nothing new and we see these once in a while. Exchanges had safeguards in place. What then happened is that the attack did not stop. They seemed intent on orphaning every single block. It seemed to stop when we hit the new difficulty and the hash rate went up.”  The attack was marked by a dramatic increase in the hash rate on the Feathercoin network, said Bushnell. The network was operating at a sustained 0.2 Gigahashes/sec prior to the attack. It jumped to 1.5 Gigahashes/sec, he said. That hashing power could have been redirected from any existing Scrypt-based pool, including a Litecoin pool.  Bushnell said he believes the people behind the attack might be linked to another attack that occurred on May 23, the day the coin went through a hard fork to reduce its difficulty. On that day, a mining pool solved a block ... but then Bushnell found the block had been orphaned by someone mining from a vanity address, “feathercoinsucks”. This suggests it was a malicious attack to undermine the coin.  This latest attack was different from other attacks, though, said Bushnell. Most other times, attacks will happen when the price of the coin rises, but they will stop when the price drops.  “The difference is that this time the markets continued to rise,” he said. “I do not think they will simply leave this time as they did last time. What is happening now is unprecedented. I have never seen a multi-pronged attack of this scale before.”  One thing that helped to save Feathercoin from the latest attack is the community of automated coin pools. These are Scrypt-based mining pools that decide what Scrypt-based altcoins are mined on, based on their profitability.  “When the difficulty changed, we became most profitable, and the pools switched to us,” Bushnell explained.  Around 80 blocks were orphaned in the attack, according to Bushnell.  “About 16,000 coins went to the attackers in this attack,” he said. “This is the proceeds of mining those blocks which orphaned ours. Those coins should have been in our miners’ pockets.”  Apart from taking profit from legitimate miners, orphaning blocks can be damaging to an altcurrency, because the orphaned blocks also contain transactions, which must then be re-transmitted. The attack also caused BTC-e to begin manually checking transactions, rather than relying on automated confirmations, which further hinders the coin.  Several people in the Feathercoin community are calling for the altcurrency to ""roll back"", reversing itself, and effectively starting again from the time before the attack happened. This would cause the blocks to be mined again.  “I doubt some people like BTC-e would be interested in doing such a thing,” Bushnell said.  Bushnell believes multiple people are behind the attack. Similar attacks have occurred on Litecoin, and Bushnell thinks the attackers might have moved on to attack Feathercoin instead, now that Litecoin’s difficulty has risen so much.  Feathercoin was still dealing with problems today. Feathercoin’s main website is currently under a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.  “There is an attack on everything to do with Feathercoin,” Bushnell said. “They have got more advanced since this used to happen to Litecoin.”  Coinchoose.com, a site that tracks altcoin statistics, had removed Feathercoin from its listings following the attack, causing the coin to also disappear from Wheretomine.com (which pulls its listings from Coinchoose.com). People in the community were lobbying to have the listings reinstated.  “I figured the market would react negatively to all this news but the buy support has stayed strong,” Bushnell said. “It shows that there is a lot of confidence in Feathercoin. We will get through these attacks I have no doubt about that.”  But he also thinks the attackers will come back: “I think that they will stick around this time as we did not die last time as they probably hoped.”  Update: Feathercoin has now implemented a new feature called 'Advanced Checkpointing'.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | LTC | MINING | FORKS,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/10/feathercoin-hit-by-massive-attack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cdb5d9360d188cc8652d2ef6ea6539b5b4e32dd2-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376506,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AqMt,1370881840,"LocalBitcoins.com Gets Swiss Bank Account Frozen, Unfrozen Due to SEPA Transfer","Regulation and security is a major issue that enterprising people in the Bitcoin economy have to deal with on a day-to-day basis. Localbitcoins, is a Finland-based marketplace for connecting people to buy and sell the currency. Recently, the site experienced an event that is an example where banking authorities have shown their authority with concern to Bitcoins.  In a blog post, Localbitcoin’s Andrei Zillo relayed the story of his company’s Swiss bank account being frozen by authorities there because of a large Bitcoin transaction. A customer that Localbitcoins had done business with in the past requested a large amount of Bitcoins for Euros. The money was sent to Localbitcoins using a Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) transfer. Localbitcoins carried out the transaction, only to later receive a request to return the funds by the bank that sent to transfer.  The problem is, Localbitcoins had already transferred BTC to the customer’s Bitcoin address. Because of this, they declined the request to return the funds to the originating bank. This resulted in the Localbitcoins Swiss account being frozen until the situation was resolved.  The predicament took three days to untangle while the bank had Localbitcoins's account frozen. While dealing with the complications arising from a transaction supposedly gone wrong, the company was able to continue operating. “We keep minimum balances on all of our accounts to minimize the impact of asset freezes due to political and criminal risks in the virtual currency industry”, Zillo explained.  Interestingly enough, the customer requesting the Bitcoins had deleted their Localbitcoins account shortly after the transaction was completed. This could be construed as suspicious activity, especially for a customer who had been regularly doing business with Localbitcoins.  “By the laws of Finland, the originating bank of a wire transfer (the Swiss bank in our case) is responsible for clearing the money and making sure the transfer is legit”, wrote Zillo. Because of this, and by providing a receipt of the transaction, including the Bitcoin addresses involved, the account was unfrozen.  Stories like this are likely to crop up from time to time as the banking industry grapples with how to handle digital currency transactions. Unlike credit cards, once Bitcoins are sent from one address to another, the transaction cannot be reversed. Many Bitcoin businesses could be confronted with problems because of this as the currency tries to gain adoption and respectability.  In the end, companies that are doing business exchanging Bitcoin for fiat currency face challenges because they inevitably have to work with the banking industry. When dealing with the exchange and transmission of currencies, it’s important to know the laws. Understanding how SEPA works, as well as regulations in other localities where Bitcoin enterprises do business is going to be important going forward.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/10/localbitcoinscom-gets-swiss-bank-account-frozen-unfrozen-due-to-sepa-transfer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a007e67a05a03e928845474aa788cdb188b6b18-300x102.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42422961,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1yvFh,1370877708,"End of Mt.Gox, future of BTC exchanges? An interview with BTC Global's Steven Morrell","If you’re not a fan of Mt. Gox, hold on tight: A Bitcoin startup based in Uruguay says it aims to shake up the world of Bitcoin exchanges.  On June 5, BTC Global announced its Massive Parallel Licensing (MPL) program, which it describes as a distributed solution to address the regulatory challenges facing Bitcoin adoption both in the US and globally.     In a Skype call with CoinDesk, Steven Morrell, one of the founders of BTC Global, talked about why he believes his company will be the Google of the Bitcoin economy.  “If you’re not a bank, you can’t become a bank,” Morrell began. “You have to do so many things in order to be a bank, that it’s nearly impossible unless you’re already well established in the financial sector.”  To start a bank from scratch, you'd need banking lawyers, compliance officers, security bonds, security bond renewal and much more. All of this takes money … so much that few startups would be able to afford it. And even then, they probably couldn’t make it work without teaming up with an already established bank.  According to Morrell, though, BTC Global’s Massive Parallel Licensing program would make it incredibly easy for people in the US and elsewhere to set up their very own local Bitcoin exchanges by joining the network. They would have on hand the support of local and international banks, compliance lawyers and proven regulatory protocol at their fingertips … enough support to set up an exchange in their state without having to shell out all the cash themselves to ensure they do everything by the book.  This essentially means we could see the Bitcoin equivalent of local banks, regional banks and credit unions springing up. People frequenting these 100-percent-compliant BTC exchanges would be able to buy, sell, store and send bitcoins as easily as they now transact in dollars at their local banks.  In fact, these Bitcoin exchanges could also act as normal banks. In theory, someone could walk in, deposit a paycheck, convert half of it into bitcoins to be secured in a cold-storage lock box and cash the other half in dollars for a night out on the town. US dollars and bitcoins could be seamlessly interchangeable in full compliance with the law. That could conceivably put Bitcoin on the path toward becoming a truly mainstream, globally accepted currency. It’s even possible that already established local banks might join BTC Global’s MPL program to add bitcoins to their current operations.  “You have people that say Bitcoin has nothing to do with the government – it’s the end of the government, the beginning of the revolution – that’s nonsense,” Morrell said. “First of all, revolution is never a good thing – revolution ends with blood on the street. We don’t need a revolution. We need an evolution and that’s what it takes to get Bitcoin mainstream and global.”  Morrell continued, “Most countries of the world have implemented a taxation system that is based on surveillance. You need to prove: what did you buy, what did you sell, what did you spend, with whom did you go to dinner and what did you have for dessert – it’s insane. A friend of mine is the director at a huge German theater, he lives in a small village an hour from Munich and he had to discuss the list of books he bought over the last two years and explain which of those books he was reading for pleasure, and which for work – it’s idiotic.”  Morrell believes Bitcoin could fundamentally change how we interact with our governments. If BTC Global has its way with its network of exchanges, he believes surveillance-based taxation could become impossible to maintain in a Bitcoin world: “It’s too much – you’re losing more money enforcing it than you will ever get back.”  Morrell said BTC Global has already made some very real and very solid partnerships with local and international banks operating in several US states. The company also has a distributed network of professionals, including commercial attorneys and more. And it has a strong foundation for funding, he added.  Funding, Uruguay-style  So why has BTC Global – a company made up of a board of directors based in the UK, US, Germany, Romania and so on – set up its headquarters in the small South American country of Uruguay, population around three million? The company’s website says why:  “Known for its reputable and stable jurisdiction, philosophy of financial deregulation, and friendliness towards foreign investors, Uruguay spells love for Bitcoin. Uruguayans regularly deal with multiple currencies: the Uruguayan peso, US dollar, the euro, and, soon, crypto-currencies. Uruguayans have a culture of strict banking secrecy. Uruguayans also make it easy for foreigners to open bank accounts. Even better, the lack of exchange controls, including a lack of limits on the transfer of funds and profit remittance, allow for frictionless business of high volumes on our exchange.”  Without Uruguay, BTC Global would not have been able to pull off its funding mechanism. Typically, funding is done by angel investors and venture capitalists, which takes a lot of time and a lot of effort. Then comes the big question, “What’s your net worth?”  “If someone asks me what the net worth of my company is, I say $1.82 million and the discussion is over,” Morrell asserted. Why? Because, at the time of this writing, that is the amount of money other people are willing to pay for it, he said.  What BTC Global has done is set up a pre-IPO auction. They are selling 6 percent of its equity, which is something it can do only because it's based in Uruguay.  “Nearly all of our investors are Bitcoiners – it’s like Facebook being funded by Facebook users,” Morrell said “The Bitcoin community is giving birth to its own offspring. In the future, we want to make this type of funding option available for other startups.”  Morrell said this funding method means he and his board of directors don’t need to waste time peddling to investors. They can get right down to business … which is what they’ve done since the company was incorporated in April.  Target: Mt. Gox     Morrell said BTC Global's aim is to far outperform current bitcoin exchanges, including the leading one, Mt. Gox.  “Our engine runs 100 times faster than theirs – our agent does over 300,000 orders per second and it’s only that low because we’re using very modest hardware,” he asserted. By setting up fully compliant and more numerous exchanges, BTC Global seeks to render today’s leaders irrelevant, he added.  Morrell is even less impressed with how we send fiat money to one another.  “When I want to send money, I have to go to the bank while it’s open, fill out a form, pay sometimes hundreds of dollars in fees, and if I’m lucky the money will arrive in three to seven business days,” he said. “It’s the same way we sent money 30 years ago. There is no reason why I shouldn’t be able to send money from A to B around the globe, when I live in a global community. It’s the biggest technological gap we have right now in our global world.”  When money takes that long to send, it's a problem. Many see Bitcoin as the natural solution. Morrell also sees it as a better way to do business in today’s highly connected world.  “We have Middle Eastern uprisings that are successful because of social media,” he said. “A Middle Eastern uprising 20 years ago would have been crushed in a massacre and no one would care. Today, we have a demonstration in Turkey and the whole world is watching and supporting and talking and discussing. We live in a 21st-century world, but we send money the 20th-century way.”  What a Bitcoin world could look like  “I want all factions of the government to have a Bitcoin address,” Morrell said. “I want to look up the DOD (Department of Defense) and see all transactions. Those 5,000 BTC you sent? What was it for? That’s my money.”  While there’s a lot of talk about how Bitcoin is anonymous, that’s not true, Morrell insists. Cash is anonymous, not bitcoins.  “There is no anonymity with Bitcoin,"" he said. “Dollars are anonymous. In the future, dirty stuff will be done in dollars and clean stuff with Bitcoin. The easiest way to launder money is in dollars. HSBC was actively and knowingly involved with money laundering for three decades. They laundered trillions of dollars, and the government didn’t touch them. Yet Liberty Reserve allegedly launders $6 billion over a 10-year period and they’re shut down and the newspapers say it’s because of Bitcoin. How do you explain that to a child in school? How do you tell them the law is the same for everyone and then show them that?”  On the other hand, if Bitcoin one day becomes mainstream and globally accepted, with exchanges set up in every state and country, every transaction from every individual will be on the blockchain. Your average, everyday individual could see how giant corporations or small businesses are spending their money and vice versa. In that scenario, the only way to really be anonymous is to deal in cash.  What would a world like that look like? Morrell thinks it would look great.  “There is always a group of people out there who think major changes will screw up our society – women voting, gays getting married, civil rights – but it always turns out just fine,"" Morrell said. ""The same is true with Bitcoin. There is nothing wrong with people being free.”  Still, even he acknowledges there are times he worries that Bitcoin will fail. At times like those, he reminds himself that change isn’t always easy.  “Sometimes I think this idea is really scary and unpredictable,” Morrell said. “But we are riding a tiger, and we can’t get off just because the tiger is upset – you have to ride the tiger. It’s the only way to do this.”  Editorial note: This piece was amended on June 11, 2013.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,William McCanless,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/10/end-of-mtgox-future-of-btc-exchanges-an-interview-with-btc-globals-steven-morrell,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/297dfa1dca012f8953fa84bd0ec1e14d6fb0918e-359x200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Well, there are a few enterprising corners dotted around the United Kingdom where brave business people have begun offering bitcoin payments. Just see Bitcoin Travel for examples, two of which can be found in the venerable city of Cambridge (which has a proud history of computer science).  We spotted an article on a blog called Cabumehttp://www.cabume.co.uk/software/bitcoin-buys-you-beer-in-cambridge-pubs.html, which describes itself as ""Tech news from the Cambridge cluster"". The post tells the story of Andrew Bower who bought a pint of beer for 0.0202 BTC, equivalent to £1.55 (GBP). For those who are super curious, the details of the transaction can be found on Blockchain.info – a QR code for the transaction was photographed in the original article (which is shown on the left).  His pint was purchased at The Haymakers (Cambridge), which is owned by a company run by a former Cambridge University computer scientist, Stephen Early. Early had installed the system and says that he believes this pint constituted the first Bitcoin transaction in Cambridge.  We also spotted on Reddit that another Cambridge pub, The Devonshire Arms, is furnishing its customers with the option to pay by bitcoin.

42376525,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AqYD,1370863821,LibertyBit exchange ceases trading,"LibertyBit, a bitcoin exchange registered in Canada has announced its temporary closure. It says that this has come as a result of bank account closures and fraudulent account activity. The exchange had been acclaimed by Reddit users for use of the Google Authenticator for two-factor authentication to increase security. Ultimately, this has not helped the business remain trouble free.  The exchange accepted transactions in both US and Canadian dollars. The latter currency, of course, benefited from Canada's Interac e-Transfer system that allows funds to be transferred by email. LibertyBit supported both deposits and withdrawals via the Email Interact system. This is in contrast to the other Canadian exchange, Virtex, which offered only withdrawals via the Interac system.  LibertyBit's home page now redirects visitors to a maintenance page with the following text:    Dear Friends,      It is with great regret that we have decided to temporarily suspend operations due to bank account closure and a surge of fraudulent transactions. The effects have been two-fold: 1) Inflicting monetary losses on the company and 2) Damaging our primary banking relationships. These circumstances make it infeasible to continue operating the service without significant changes to our transfer system and identification measures. We feel it is our responsibility to pause operations now rather than risk any customer funds becoming vulnerable. We will be working in the coming weeks with partners and our legal counsel to overcome these obstacles and implement new measures to prevent these types of setbacks in the future.    Please be aware that all CAD, USD, and BTC funds are secure. Users are free to login and withdraw their funds through our system. However, given the anticipated volume, currency-processing times will take longer than usual and BTC will need to be transferred from cold storage. Therefore, please anticipate the following timeline for withdrawals:    While email INTERAC is no longer available, direct deposit will be offered to all users. Also, all currently open orders will be cancelled and those funds will become available.    These last six months have been a wild ride. We've had an incredible opportunity to take part in the Bitcoin revolution and help thousands of new and experienced users trade more easily. A big thank you to everyone who has supported us, pushed us, and given us valuable suggestions to make this service even better. Bringing Libertybit to life has been our passion for the last year, and it's been an honor to offer this service to all of you.    Thank you again for all your support.

42376517,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AqVh,1370854629,Feathercoin launches eBay-style auction marketplace,"Feathercoin, an altcurrency based on Litecoin, has today announced that it is opening an auction site to facilitate the trade of physical items between individuals paid for by Feathercoins. The site is at an early phase of development but already has 70 auctions ongoing. It also supports a feedback system so sellers can build a reputation, much like eBay. Feathercoin says that the site will soon implement a shopping cart and a range of merchant tools.  Peter Bushnell, the founder of Feathercoin, told us that the service had been created to solve the problem of forum users trying to auction off items on forums, often without someone standing in as an escrow provider. Bushnell also told us:  ""To begin with members will either use external escrow or pay directly to each other. The next phase of the site will be to create online wallets and a built in escrow system.""  However, the primary goal of the marketplace is to facilitate mainstream adoption of Feathercoins – surely a relative term compared against the 'mainstream' adoption of Bitcoin. The Feathercoin founder had this to say…  ""The focus is on merchant adoption. Rather than just asking merchants to use Feathercoin, we are working to provide them with the tools to make this happen. If we do most of the hard work, merchants will be able to easily integrate Feathercoins into their existing payment solutions. We are asking merchants to tell us what they need and then respond to that with our development.""  Going forward, the road map for Feathercoin's auction house looks something like this:    1. Create Feathercoin shopping carts for several well used systems.      2. Create an API for merchants to use, this can be queried for the current value of FTC in different currencies and will return total price in FTC when queried with real world currencies.

42376527,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Aqfl,1370847639,How to create a brain wallet,"For those CoinDesk readers who have started trading with Bitcoin, there is the inevitable concern of how to protect ones' wallet. The so-called wallet is a simple data file that contains a set of Bitcoin (or insert your preferred currency here) addresses. That's all you need to keep your Ecoins with you. The block chain is copied to every single client has a list of every single transaction and balance for your given currency, e.g. Bitcoin. The security of the wallet depends on the security of your computer or smartphone. What if you could embed your money inside your mind? We explain how to create a brain wallet.  Wallets are intangible  The problem with Bitcoin wallets, is that the receiving addresses are difficult to remember, so you need to keep a record of them. If that record is lost, you won't remember them, and when gone all the money is gone with them. That's why it's imperative to keep it back up.  Duplication isn’t a problem because the addresses are unique and are all kept up to date via the block chain. Even using different clients works well because all transactions, and thus balances, are synchronised via the universal block chain for your chosen currency.  Because of the ubiquity of the of the block chain, a public ledger which every virtual currency requires, transactions are globally in sync with every user of a given currency. The only benefit of so-called ""cloud wallets"" is that your addresses are backed up and synchronised across devices. Sure, the cloud services (e.g. Coinbase) will handle the transactions for you and so your multi-device experience should be faster because they are not synchronising with the block chain, but with a summary of your cloud-based wallet.  The problem with the wallet  As stated above, if you lose access to your wallet you have lost your bitcoins. Also, if your wallet is not encrypted or if someone gains access to your bitcoin client, your funds can be easily misappropriated. Because the private key to each address must be used to prove you are you in a transaction is included, and someone could put in one of their addresses as a recipient and send from your client.  Keeping your wallet out of harm's way  One way to keep your wallet from being accidentally deleted, or emptied by an intruder is to keep the details of the account stored purely in your mind. Now of course, a bitcoin address along with the accompanying public and private keys are far too much for the average person to remember. Fortunately, all of those numbers can be calculated from a single pass phrase (i.e. A password). If you can think of a strong phrase, and jumble it up with deliberate misspellings and substitute some letters for visually similar numbers or symbols, you then have a highly secure system. The only problem you then face is law enforcement or criminals compelling you to give up your passphrase. In this case, you might be able to get away with creating a dummy pass phrase to an address that you already have some bitcoins on. However, due to the block chain, whoever is forcing you to divulge your pass phrase may know you are lying.  However, in most cases the legal precedents are still being set for whether you are required to give up a key to law enforcement. In the US, it's still being debated on the grounds of the Fifth Amendment. The Silk Road case is very interesting in this regard.  Tools to create a mind wallet  To reemphasise, the pass phrase needs to be long and difficult to guess. For example, ""coyn Desk is th3 mo$t !ncredible bl0G in teh werld"". Here, I've gone for phonetics, character substitutions and misspellings. Importantly though, I've used them inconsistently. If you want multiple addresses to build up your wallet, simply put a description or number index at the end of the passphrase.  Once you have something you will be able to remember, you need to generate the address and keys. I have found a couple of online tools to do this, there is bitaddress.org, but more versatile is the specifically named brainwallet.org. It allows you to reconstruct from not just the pass phrase, but also from its SHA 256 digest or the original private key.  Using the mind wallet  Once you can generate your bitcoin address from your passphrase you'll need to put it to use. If you are completing a transaction in your browser, you can just paste the relevant codes into a form. Alternatively you cold import the wallet back into your bitcoin client.  To do this, open bitcoin-qt on your desktop, open the Help menu and select ""Debug Window"". Then, click on the ""Console"" tab, and type in  Importprivkey [Your private key here without brackets] ""The label that you want in quote marks""  It will take a while for your client to import the data as it has to trace the bitcoin address back through the complete block chain to obtain the full balance of bitcoins. (Of course, you'll have to find alternative instructions for importing a private key if you use a different desktop client, e.g. Amory.)
