42381301,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94XIh,1538431842,Crypto Exchange ShapeShift Calls Money Laundering Claims 'Deceptive',"ShapeShift has issued a stinging rebuke of a Wall Street Journal investigative article that claimed the crypto exchange was used by criminals to launder money.  In a blog post published Monday, CEO Erik Voorhees said the news outlet's report showed a misunderstanding of how cryptocurrencies work and that the article's claims were factually incorrect.  Calling the claims ""factually inaccurate and deceptive,"" Voorhees wrote that his exchange had been working with the Journal for nearly half a year, but the final story ""omitted relevant information"" and showed that ""the authors do not have a sufficient understanding of blockchain and our platform in particular.""  The article – published Friday – follows an investigation by the Journal into cryptocurrency exchanges. The authors concluded that some $88 million was laundered through 46 different exchanges over two years, with $9 million going through ShapeShift in that period. This was the largest sum sent through any U.S.-based exchange, the report said (though registered in Switzerland, ShapeShift operates out of the state of Colorado).  Voorhees wrote that ""even if it was true"" that $9 million was laundered through ShapeShift, it would represent only 0.15 percent of the exchange's total volume. Moreover, the exchange has ""a strong record of complying with law-enforcement requests, providing valuable assistance in over 30 investigations in 13 different countries all over the world.""  He also claimed users cannot launder fiat currencies through the exchange, saying:  ""Unlike most other exchanges, ShapeShift is a crypto-to-crypto, non-custodial platform. We don't take custody of user funds, but instead swap our own assets for theirs, at a set price. We don't touch fiat currency, so users cannot swap their dollars/euros/yen for our bitcoin/ethereum/dogecoin. Not a single dollar, euro, or yen has ever been laundered through ShapeShift. It can't be done.""  Understanding transactions  Voorhees claimed that some fundamental misunderstandings of how wallet addresses work may have resulted in some of the Journal's conclusions.  He cited one example, saying that funds from a suspicious transaction were sent to an exchange, which later sent funds to ShapeShift.  ""Because ShapeShift happens to be a customer of this same exchange – 10 months later in a completely unrelated transaction – the exchange sent funds to ShapeShift. The authors didn't understand how to properly read the blockchain transactions, so they assumed there was $70k in 'dirty money' sent to ShapeShift,"" he wrote.  Voorhees said ShapeShift has asked the Journal for additional transaction information to verify other claims, but the news organization has so far not done so.  Data transparency  Voorhees also asserted that ShapeShift is one of the most transparent exchanges operating today.  Every transaction through the exchange is published online, despite the user privacy protections that it has maintained to date, he wrote.  The Journal relied on this information to conduct its investigation, he said, adding that ""perhaps the irony is lost on the WSJ, but the WSJ would have been unable to do this kind of investigation with any other crypto exchange, because they aren't transparent in this way.""  ""Ultimately, we are trying to pioneer a new financial system,"" he concluded. ""We don't expect to be loved by the old ... yet ShapeShift has always been in favor of complying with the laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates, even though many of these laws are unclear, ever-changing, contradictory, and in some cases ineffective.""

42381303,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94XLD,1538424020,Ripple Event Reveal: 3 Companies Are Now Using XRP for Real Payments,"After a series of highly-publicized pilots, three companies are now making commercial use of Ripple's xRapid product.  XRapid employs the digital asset XRP, using it as a ""bridge currency"" in cross-border payments, which according to the company, reduces the cost and increases the speed of these payments by boosting liquidity.  The three companies – MercuryFX, Cuallix and Catalyst Corporate Credit Union – were announced by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse on stage at Ripple's Swell conference in San Francisco today, marking the first time companies have put the product to commercial use.  MercuryFX, which helps clients send and receive international payments; and Cuallix, which facilitates remittances between the U.S. and Mexico; had previously announced pilots using xRapid.  Catalyst Corporate Federal Credit Union, which provides a range of financial services to around 1,400 credit unions, primarily in the western and southwestern U.S., is a new partner for Ripple.  A number of other firms have trialed xRapid in the past, including Western Union, MoneyGram, Viamericas and IDT. These firms are not putting xRapid into production at this time, Ripple SVP of product Asheesh Birla told CoinDesk, but he added, ""we are still working on next steps"" with some of them.  The announcement is an important milestone for XRP, a digital asset first created by Ripple's founders – though the company was going by a different name at the time – in 2012.  Ripple holds the majority of the XRP tokens in existence, selling them continuously through its subsidiary XRP II (in Q2, for example, the company sold $74 million worth of XRP).  XRP is currently the third-most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, based on investors' bet that Ripple's product suite will eventually displace the current infrastructure for cross-border payments, including nostro and vostro accounts (which banks must pre-fund with local currencies) and the aging SWIFT messaging system.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Birla outlined how the current system works:  ""Today if you want to move money, let's just say into Mexico […] the ways to do it were built in the 1960s. It really hasn't changed.""  Specifically, he continued, ""You have to open up a bank account in Mexico, and you have to deposit pesos in that bank account, and then you pay out locally. And that whole process sometimes takes weeks, and the setting up of a bank account is a whole treasury operation that takes months to get going.""  In contrast, xRapid processes cross-border payments by XRP, with the sending party putting fiat into a cryptocurrency exchange, converting it to XRP, and converting that XRP to the receiving party's desired fiat currency.  Ripple recently announced three exchange partnerships to facilitate this process: Bittrex, for U.S. dollars; Bitso, for Mexican pesos; and Coins.ph, for Philippine pesos. Market makers on the exchanges, who are not affiliated with Ripple, act as counterparties for fiat-to-XRP trades.  In a recent interview, MercuryFX founder and director Alastair Constance said xRapid was ""a revelation,"" adding that it cut the time needed to send a payment from the UK to Mexico from two days to two minutes.  If xRapid resembles bullet trains, Constance said, the incumbent system – comprised of SWIFT and correspondent banks – is like pushing oranges around in wheelbarrows.  Confusion around clients  As those who follow XRP's raucous enthusiasts on social media know, perhaps the main thesis for investing in XRP is that it will eventually enjoy wide – if not universal adoption – by banks for cross-border payments (and perhaps other uses).  A number of banks have expressed interest in Ripple's xCurrent product, and Santander has incorporated it into a consumer-facing mobile app. But xCurrent does not use XRP, and Ripple has sent mixed signals in the past regarding banks' interest in xRapid.  Birla told CoinDesk in a recent interview, ""We built xCurrent as a product to get banks started – we'll start them using fiat transfers and then we'll introduce later on the ability to use digital assets through xRapid. So we're layering on xRapid on top of xCurrent.""  On the other hand, David Schwartz – who was Ripple's chief cryptographer before becoming CTO in July – said in March that xRapid is ""not aimed at banks.""  Yet in June, Garlinghouse predicted that ""dozens"" of banks would adopt xRapid by the end of 2019. Muddying the picture further, Schwartz said just a week later that banks may be slow to adopt distributed ledgers, due to privacy and scalability concerns.  Outside of the question of bank adoption, Ripple's messaging has sometimes made it difficult to parse who is putting its products to use, and how.  A press release from January said, ""Ripple is proud to announce that two new partners — IDT Corporation and MercuryFX — will now use xRapid to settle retail remittances and corporate transactions quickly.""  IDT is a publicly traded telecommunications firm.  That announcement did not specify that the companies were not using xRapid commercially, with the exception of a quote from an IDT official that said the company was ""excited to pilot"" xRapid.  Following today's announcement that xRapid is ""commercially available,"" thought, it is clear in retrospect that MercuryFX wasn't using the product commercially.  Constance explained that the company has been using xRapid to process payments to a charity in Mexico in what he called ""a test phase.""  Monetizing xRapid  Birla declined to say how or whether Ripple is monetizing xRapid.  Constance of MercuryFX – asked if his firm was paying for use of the service – said: ""We've been using the XRP ledger on the basis that the money's not important right now. It's the dream that we're chasing that is.""  Ripple's director of corporate communications Tom Channick said in an email that ""xRapid is part of the RippleNet suite of products, which is sold to financial institutions.""  As noted above, Ripple sells XRP on a continual basis through a subsidiary, so all else being equal, an increase in demand for XRP would boost Ripple's revenues.  Asked if demand for XRP could be expected to rise as a result of xRapid being deployed commercially, Birla said:  ""The xRapid product leverages XRP, so if you are doing a million dollars a payment through xRapid, that is a million dollars of XRP that you would need.""  However, he noted that institutions like MercuryFX do not need to hold XRP themselves (according to Constance, though, MercruyFX does hold XRP as an investment).  Rather, independent market makers trading on exchanges are the ones who need to hold XRP, Birla said.

42381304,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94XMT,1538421016,Bill Clinton: Over-Regulation Could Kill Blockchain's 'Golden Goose',"Former U.S. President Bill Clinton took the stage at a cryptocurrency industry conference Monday to offer words of warning to lawmakers seeking to regulate what he characterized as a promising technology advance.  Onstage at Ripple's Swell conference in San Francisco, Clinton was joined by Gene Sperling, a former White House advisor who sits on Ripple's board of directors. Clinton – who served as U.S. president between 1993 and 2001 – was the top speaker at the event, which saw former Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke take the stage last year.  Indeed, the company has been pushing into establishment circles with particular enthusiasm in recent months. Just days ago, it was reported that Ripple and others had created the Securing America's Internet of Value Coalition (SAIV), an advocacy group that will pay its DC lobbying firm partly in XRP.  During the question-and-answer session with Sperling, Clinton touched on a wide range of topics such as the cybersecurity challenges facing the U.S. government. He also discussed topics seemingly outside the bounds of a financial technology conference, including gun laws, foreign policy and his recently published novel.  Yet perhaps most relevant for the audience at Swell was Clinton's remark about the ""disparity of access"" to new technologies like blockchain as they develop and grow, pointing to the emergence of e-commerce solutions in the late 1990s as a parallel.  Clinton remarked:  ""The more you develop new technologies like blockchain … AI technologies, robotic technologies … the more the disparity of access is going to be felt.""  He also acknowledged the sentiment that new technologies can be abused, hinting at the concerns that cryptocurrencies can be used by terrorists or other criminals to launder money. Referring to similar concerns over technologies like the Global Positioning System (GPS), Clinton noted that ""there needs to be an intelligent effort to identify the downsides"" and that ""you can't apply [an] old regulatory regime to a new technology.""  ""You end up killing the goose that laid the golden egg,"" he went on to add.  On the topic of blockchain itself, Clinton remarked that ""this whole blockchain deal has the potential it does only because it is applicable across national borders, income groups.""  He went on to say:  ""The permutations and possibilities are staggeringly great. But we could ruin it all by negative identity politics and economic and social policy.""

42381309,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94XSl,1538418082,Bitcoin Price Ends September At Lowest Volatility in 15 Months,"Bitcoin traded in a range of just under $1,500 over the course of the month of September, its narrowest monthly trading range since July 2017, data reveals.  At close of trading Sunday, bitcoin (BTC) officially ended the 30-day period with a trading range of $1,329, with prices oscillating between a low of $6,100 and a high of $7,429. Overall, this was the lowest one-month range since July 2017, when bitcoin traded in a $1,095.8 window, according to data from Bitfinex.  Further, the monthly trading volume throughout September marked its lowest amount since April 2017, according to the exchange, one of the world's largest.  Periods of low volatility often come to a boisterous end for bitcoin especially when accompanied by low volume, so it seems the cryptocurrency is gearing up for a decisive move in either direction.  Monthly Chart  Bitcoin concluded its September candlestick inside the low and high of the prior month's candlestick, creating a pattern known as the ""inside bar pattern."" In trending markets, the pattern can present strong buy or sell signals if current prices surpass the range of the prior month.  Since the market for bitcoin has been in a bearish downtrend since December of 2017, current prices falling below the low of September ($6,100) would likely confirm more downside action is to come and set scope for prior support/resistance level near $4,900.  On the other hand, if September's range high is surpassed ($7,429), it would be a bullish indication for longer-term upside potential and possible bull market revival.  20-Month Moving Average  The current bear market draws many parallels to that of bitcoin's bear market in 2014-15.  Notably, the current bear market just began its 11th month, while prices now sitting on the 20-month moving average (MA) for support. The timing is rather impeccable when compared to the 2014 market since its 11th month also rested on the 20-month MA.  This would suggest a decisive move could be incoming since falling below the MA in the 12th month of the 2014 bear market further cemented the trend in bearish favor, of which it was unable to escape until returning above the MA in November of 2015.  View  This will be a decisive month for bitcoin as the low volatility suggests a big move is coming in either direction.  Falling below September's low of $6,100 opens the door to prior support/resistance level near $4,900, while rising above Septembers high could signal a bull market revival.  Falling below the 20-month MA would likely confirm several more months of the bear market are ahead.  Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.

42381300,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94XHR,1538413214,Two of Blockchain's Biggest Consortiums Just Joined Forces,"Seismic shifts are happening in the world of enterprise blockchain.  Announced Monday, the Hyperledger Project and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) have agreed to collaborate on bringing common standards to the blockchain space and cross-pollinate a wider open-source community.  This joining of forces is notable as EEA and Hyperledger represent two of the three largest and arguably most influential enterprise blockchain communities, the third being the R3 Corda ecosystem.  If the team-up succeeds in creating common standards between the two platforms, it could sway enterprises previously on the fence to build their blockchains on one or the other, since the risk of creating new silos that don't talk to other systems is being addressed.  As EEA executive director Ron Resnick told CoinDesk:  ""The enterprises of the world are going to want to purchase solutions where they have a choice of multiple vendors.""  Further, for Hyperledger's 270 member organizations, there is now the promise of interacting with tokens and smart contracts on the ethereum public chain.  Stepping back, Hyperledger was founded as an umbrella organization – cast in the image of the Linux Foundation – for open source blockchain development, comprising a number of protocols designed specifically for enterprises. Meanwhile, the 500-member EEA is a standards organization looking to build private or permissioned businesses applications on the foundations of the public ethereum blockchain.  But over time, there has been growing support for ethereum within Hyperledger. Formalizing that convergence, the new alliance ""will enable Hyperledger developers to write code that conforms to the EEA specification and certify them through EEA certification testing programs expected to launch in the second half of 2019,"" the organizations said in a blog post published Monday.  Brian Behlendorf, Hyperledger's executive director, told CoinDesk that the EEA's work on standards and attempt to align a whole universe of different vendors into a common enterprise picture is very complementary to Hyperledger.  ""It's a two-way street. There's not a lot of groups effectively doing standards in the blockchain space today and EEA has a head start there. What can we contribute to that momentum?"" said Behlendorf.  He said both groups can now work on a reference implementation (a software standard from which all other implementations and corresponding customizations are derived). ""We think that doing that as a project or a lab at Hyperledger would be interesting,"" he said.  Building bridges  Illustrating how the Hyperledger community had already been moving in an ethereum-friendly direction: earlier this year Sawtooth (a codebase contributed to Hyperledger by Intel) added support for the ethereum virtual machine (EVM) as a transaction processor. This made it possible to bring smart contracts developed for the public ethereum blockchain over to Sawtooth-based networks.  That effort, dubbed ""Seth,"" is now in active use, and gathering some momentum. Sawtooth proponent Dan Middleton was recently elected chairman of Hyperledger's technical steering committee and Seth awaits ""conformance testing to the EEA specification as soon as possible,"" according to the joint statement by Hyperledger and EEA.  Meanwhile, EVM work is also now underway with Fabric, arguably Hyperledger's flagship protocol.  This work, which will start to really come to the fore in Fabric 1.3, aims to allow users to run ethereum smart contracts and also be able to have ERC-20 and ERC-721 (the standards that gave rise to ICOs and CryptoKitties, respectively) as the token model on Fabric, as currently is the case on Sawtooth.  Behlendorf said he keeps an open mind about how these architectures might evolve. ""I think in the long term the benefits of one accrue to the other,"" he said in reference to Sawtooth and Fabric. ""Whether that means they and other frameworks will merge together or specialize, it's still an open book.""  Working on common standards and building bridges between communities would seem to pave the way to some future state of interoperability – an often talked-of ideal in the blockchain world.  ""I do think that interoperability between ledgers will happen at a much higher level in the stack than most people expect,"" explained Behlendorf. In other words, building common standards and data formats, rather than monkeying with complex consensus protocols, will link use cases in a multi-chain universe.  As well as the working with the EVM, Hyperledger developers also want to keep a close eye on decisions being taken within the ethereum community around using WebAssembly, a coding standard for web pages, to potentially make the next generation of the public blockchain protocol more JavaScript-orientated.  ""We are tracking this very closely in Burrow [a third Hyperledger implementation] and in Sawtooth and would like to be there as soon as they make that call,"" said Behlendorf.  R3's a crowd?  All this talk of collaboration and mutual benefit might have you imagining the whole enterprise blockchain community gathered around a campfire singing ""Kumbaya,"" but make no mistake: this is still a fiercely competitive field. And R3, which boasts more than 200 members and partners across multiple industries, clearly views EEA and Hyperledger as its competitors.  In a recent interview,  R3 lead platform engineer Mike Hearn seemed to anticipate the announcement of an alliance between the EEA and Hyperledger, which he dismissed as more of ""a marketing event rather than a major change to the way the platforms work.""  Behlendorf agreed that this joining of forces is, to an extent, about marketing, but not just to end-user organizations and the vendor community – marketing to developers.  ""This is about letting developers know where our organizations are,"" he explained. ""It's about where the industry is going and where you may want to contribute to that momentum, to benefit from it; if you want to be tribal and fight against it, that's your choice as well.""  Whatever you want to call it, in terms of strategy, a strong alliance between the EEA and Hyperledger would seem to put them on one side and R3 on the other.  Even so, R3 is definitely invited to the party, said Resnick. ""I already asked them to join us. Will they agree? That might be a different story.""  However, Resnick said R3 is different from Hyperedger or EEA in that ""they are not really open source,"" making the distinction between open source and ""open-core,"" where open source software is centered around a single vendor.  ""With a proprietary solution such as R3's, you've got to buy stuff from them. That's not what we are about and it's not what Hyperledger is about,"" said Resnick, concluding:  ""The question is, are they going to last?""

42381299,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94XGB,1538409642,Kill Switch Engage: Sia Cryptocurrency to Block Bitmain and Other Big Miners,"After nearly a year of acrimonious debate, the Sia blockchain is moving to give big mining companies the boot.  David Vorick, founder and CEO of Nebulous – the for-profit company behind the $233 million distributed storage protocol – told CoinDesk that Sia will soon move to enact a software change meant to block certain types of specialized mining hardware from the platform, allowing hardware manufactured by Nebulous subsidiary Obelisk to remain one of the only ways to collect the blockchain's lucrative cryptocurrency rewards.  ""Sia's decided to fork to obsolete or brick the Innosilicon and Bitmain hardware,"" Vorick said, referring to Obelisk's rival manufacturers of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining equipment for Siacoin.  In a draft statement on the decision acquired by CoinDesk, Vorick wrote that the company wants to embrace an ""ASIC monopoly,"" arguing the system-wide upgrade, or hard fork – ""is better than resisting ASICs altogether."" That said, he added: ""We don't believe that a cryptocurrency needs to embrace a parasitic or abusive ASIC monopoly.""  Continuing, Vorick emphasized that the code change is optional, and is configured in such a way as to ""enable a group of dissenters to easily split off and be on a separate blockchain where the hard fork was never implemented."" According to the blog post, such a split will not impact the functionality of the Sia network.  Still, Vorick portrayed the code change as a near-unanimous decision taken by the community, and this Reddit thread – the closest thing to an official vote that was held in the community – appears to show broad support for the decision. The sentiments expressed represent a change from January, when another proposal to similarly fork Siacoin failed.  During those months of back-and-forth, some community members appeared just as concerned about Nebulous' consolidation of power as they were about Bitmain or Innosilicon (the latter, Vorick made clear, is the ""monopoly"" he has in mind).  Meanwhile, some in the community saw a fork as amounting to a bailout of Obelisk by Nebulous – a way to turn back the clock on production delays, political rifts and threats of legal action. The Reddit post containing the proposal argues, however, that it ""seeks to protect the community members who invested in Obelisk ASIC units,"" not the company itself.  Bricking Innosilicon  In his statement and an interview with CoinDesk, Vorick described the motivation and method for bricking Innosilicon's ASIC miners.  Vorick said that Innosilicon controls 37.5 percent of the network's total mining power through its own mining operation. The company also sells ASICs to other miners. Since they ""have the only rig capable of competing,"" Vorick wrote, Innosilicon is able to charge an estimated 100 percent markup on this hardware.  Speaking to CoinDesk, he described the method behind the so-called Sia kill switch, or the software change to disable hardware which the fork will activate:  ""Basically blake2b [Sia's hash algorithm] is a circuit, and we added just a tiny extension in a clever place that you wouldn't just naively think to add that extension. So basically we made our circuit just very slightly more complex in a very sort of random way, and this is something that we do not expect anyone else to have anticipated.""  As a result, as soon as the network's nodes adopt the upgrade, chips designed to run the unaltered blake2b algorithm will be useless for mining Siacoin.  ""We believe that this will break tens of millions of dollars of hardware,"" said Vorick.  Notably, other networks have considered or followed through with similar forks aimed at disabling ASICs. For example, Monero did so in April, and momentum is building toward a similar change in the second largest blockchain by market capitalization, ethereum.  Sia's decision is unique, however, in that the goal is not to keep ASICs off the network entirely – Vorick has written that this is a losing battle and diminishes a coin's security – but to block ASICs made by particular companies.  If Innosilicon and Bitmain move as fast as possible to produce new hardware, Vorick told CoinDesk, they may be able to replace the bricked ASICs in three or four months. In the interim, then, miners sold by Sia's sister venture Obelisk will have the run of the network.  But there are risks inherent in such a fork.  Vorick noted in a blog post that, in the short term, the move to remove the hardware – currently comprising the majority of the network's hashrate – will be ""a step backwards"" for Sia's security. Still, the developer continued by arguing that the effort will lead to a ""healthy mining community and a higher overall difficulty"" in the long term.  'Protectionist' fork?  For some, the decision to brick some ASICs in order to favor hardware manufactured by a Nebulous subsidiary is a suspicious one. Vorick said that the decision ""originated from the community"" and met with ""almost no dissent,"" but it is likely to be seen by some as a decision taken by Nebulous for its own benefit.  ""This Obelisk fork is an example of the dev team acting as a central influence to modify the network protocol to save their own investment,"" a Reddit user wrote in August when the fork was still being discussed. ""This sort of centralized influence is exactly what we strive to avoid in the blockchain world.""  Another user called the proposed fork ""protectionist.""  To understand the debate that's unfolded – and which this decision may or may not bring to a close – it's necessary to go back to June 2017, when Obelisk was publicly unveiled, along with its plans to sell a Sia ASIC.  By December, said Vorick, Sia developers were already receiving ""unverifiable"" tips (detailed by a Sia community member on Medium) that someone had secretly built their own ASIC and was using it to mine Siacoin. The following month, Bitmain publicly revealed their Sia ASIC, and it soon became clear that the company had been using it to mine on the network since November.  Innosilicon then announced a faster blake2b ASIC in April, displacing Bitmain's product.  If being beaten to market twice weren't bad enough, Obelisk missed its June 30 target for shipping the first batch of ASICs by weeks, leading to threats of legal action from at least two parties, as CoinDesk reported in August.  Zach Herbert, Obelisk's VP of operations, said of the legal threats: ""Obelisk has fewer than five small claims suits and arbitration claims in various jurisdictions. While we have received legal threats from a couple customers, none have filed lawsuits against Obelisk or Nebulous.""  As for the possibility that Nebulous is pushing a fork in order to reduce legal threats against its subsidiary, Herbert dismissed that idea.  ""We do not believe the Sia fork will have a significant impact on existing legal actions,"" he told CoinDesk.

42381293,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94X7N,1538407855,Ethereum Startup Parity Adds Casper Code to Custom Blockchain Toolbox,"Parity Technologies has added an early version of ethereum's hotly anticipated Casper code change to its blockchain development platform, Substrate.  Released on GitHub yesterday, the code more specifically contains a mechanism to transition to the ""Shasper"" upgrade, that combines the platform's in-house scaling solution, sharding, alongside its proof-of-stake consensus switch, Casper.  ""Shasper is combination of Casper and sharding. Once it lands, we should see vast improvements in terms of ethereum's transaction throughput,"" Wei Tang, the developer leading the Parity integration, told CoinDesk.  Continuing, Wei described the Substrate implementation as a ""basic skeleton"" that has yet to undergo testing, but added that interested parties can already run the codebase. Once more additions have been made to the software, in particular, the rules surrounding block creation, Wei said a shared Shasper test network can follow.  Still, the developer described this as ""only be the first step,"" telling CoinDesk: ""To really make Shasper work, there are still a lot of specification research work, as well as implementation work to be done.""  Regarding today's release, he said:  ""On one hand, we show that Substrate is a general framework that works for many different blockchains. On the other hand, we can hopefully provide more inputs for the Shasper specification, and speed up its development.""  Authored by ethereum co-founder and Parity founder Gavin Wood, Substrate is a modular blockchain development framework aimed to enable projects to build custom blockchains. Substrate offers simplified tooling to implement the Shasper change, compared to the ethereum network itself, according to Wei.  ""Shasper's block definitions have changed vastly – nearly everything's different, including block definitions, hashing algorithms, encodings, etc,"" Wei told CoinDesk.  While this creates a host of implementation challenges for ethereum, he said:  ""[Substrate] tries to define a general framework for blockchains. It works for Shasper.""

42381305,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94XNj,1538401248,Most ICOs Didn't Take Funding Hit Despite Ether Price Decline: Research,"Despite the big drops in cryptocurrency prices since late last year, ICO projects haven't lost money on average, according to new research from BitMEX.  The research team from the cryptocurrency trading platform published the new work Monday, having teamed up with crypto data cruncher TokenAnalyst to track the ethereum (ETH) balances of 222 ICOs over time.  Specifically, the researchers looked at the amount of ETH raised by the projects and the U.S. dollar value of the gains and losses that arose from the cryptocurrency's price shifts.  The researchers say that the fall in the value of ETH this year did not cause hardship at projects overall.  On the contrary, the paper summary states:  ""At the macro level, the projects appear to have already sold almost as much Ethereum as they raised (in US$ terms). Of the Ethereum still held by the projects, even at the current c$230 price, projects are still sitting on unrealised gains, rather than losses.""  BitMEX notes that the totals provided in the paper may be lower than some other sources, as they looked only at ETH balances and did not include funds raised via other tokens.  The team indicates that, following the fall in the value of ETH, some in the industry had raised the possibility of a ""downward price spiral"" due to big pools of ETH held by ICO projects. Further, the price drop was feared to raise the likelihood of ""panic selling"" across projects.  However, the 222 ICOs tracked raised $5.5 billion-worth of ETH in total, according to the work, and appear to have since sold a very similar amount – producing a total only $11 million less.  Further, the projects still hold 3.8 million ETH, around 25 percent of the tokens originally raised, says BitMEX.  It adds:  ""However, in US$ terms, these projects have essentially already sold the same amount of Ethereum which they originally raised, leaving them a nice holding of US$830m of Ethereum.""  The researchers do stress that the data is ""somewhat skewed"" by the EOS project, which raised around 70 percent of the ETH (by USD value) of all the projects tracked. However, removing the EOS from the data, still leads to ""similar"" conclusions, they say.  Regarding unrealized profits and losses, BitMEX says the ICOs still have net gains of $93 million based on an ETH price of $215 (at press time, an ether is worth $230).  ""It may surprise some that ICOs are still in a net unrealized profit situation, but many of the Ethereum balances were built up before the price rally at the end of 2017,"" the team says.  So, while some projects may have experienced major losses, the gross losses across projects comes to $311 million, per the data. That is ""more than offset"" by $403 million in gross unrealized gains, the researchers say.

As reported by CoinDesk, Malta's parliament passed three bills regarding cryptocurrencies, blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) back in June.  Since then a number of cryptocurrency-focused firms including the Binance exchange have moved to set up business entities on the island, with some agreeing partnerships with Malta's stock exchange.  In his speech, which had previously addressed issues such as immigration, Muscat continued to take a bullish tone on the technology, saying:  ""Blockchain makes cryptocurrencies the inevitable future of money, more transparent since it helps filter good businesses from bad businesses.""  Not only that, the PM concluded, distributed ledger technology also has the potential to give patients ""real ownership"" of their medical records, it can ""verify that humanitarian assistance is reaching it's intended destination,"" and it helps bring more accountability to corporations and governments.  While the country has taken the lead to regulate blockchain and cryptocurrency, other jurisdictions are also moving towards setting up frameworks governing firms using the tech, but aimed not to stifle business or innovation.  Bermuda  , for example, is also hoping to draw more companies to the island by providing regulatory certainty with new legislation that would allow initial coin offerings under certain conditions. It has also set up a task force to foster cryptocurrency commerce.  There have also been moves within the EU to develop new rules for cryptos, with one lawmaker also proposing standards for ICOs that would allow token sale projects to operate across the economic zone.

42381307,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94XOz,1538391621,Sign Emerges That Falling Bitcoin Price Just Might Have a Floor,"Bitcoin (BTC) seems to have built a base around a key moving average in the last four months, although, so far, it has not been able to produce a definitive bullish breakout.  Throughout 2018, the leading cryptocurrency has set lower price highs, indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside.  Despite the bearish setup, the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) has served as a strong floor since June. More importantly, the failure to beat the EMA support for four straight months indicates that the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December has likely run its course.  So, it seems safe to say that the stage has been set for the cryptocurrency to jump above the recent lower price high of $7,429 hit a month ago and confirm a bearish-to-bullish trend change.  Even so, the bulls have been reluctant to push prices north of $6,800 in the last two weeks. Still, since BTC tends to perform well in the last three months of the calendar year, that may be about to change.  At press time, BTC is trading largely unchanged on the day at $6,585 on Bitfinex.  Monthly chart  As seen on the monthly chart, BTC produced a minor rally to $8,500 in July, after finding support at the 21-month EMA in June.  Further, the sellers failed to penetrate the EMA support in August and September, establishing it as a key level to watch out for in the near-term.  Daily chart  Over on the daily chart, the 5-day and 10-day EMAs are flatlined, indicating that the bitcoin market is currently lacking a clear directional bias.  The outlook as per the daily chart would turn bullish if and when the cryptocurrency finds acceptance above the trendline connecting the July 25 high and Sept. 5 high. As of writing, the trendline resistance is located at $6,802.  The bear failure, as seen in the monthly chart, does indicate scope for a break above the trendline hurdle in the near-term.  View  BTC seems to have bottomed out around the 21-month EMA, currently located at $6,150.  A UTC close above the falling trendline seen in the daily chart would open up upside toward $7,429 (September high). A high volume move above that level would add credence to BTC's repeated defense of the 21-month EMA and confirm a bearish-to-bullish trend change.  On the downside, a convincing move below the 21-month EMA will likely embolden the bears.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

According to a press release, the strategic partnership sees the two entities seeking new ""applications and use cases"" for blockchain, as well as ""growth opportunities"" for the tech within Opera products.  Opera is not new to the blockchain space and is notably developing a cryptocurrency wallet that is built into its Android browser. It opened the beta-stage product to the public in July. In September, it added a feature that lets users send crypto collectibles, such as CryptoKitties, directly from the wallet.  The firm has also seen investment from bitcoin mining giant Bitmain, which holds a 3 percent stake, accding to its recent'y published IPO prospectus.  On the new partnership, Ding'an Fei, managing partner at Ledger Capital, said:  ""Opera has already taken the lead among the major browsers, with the integration of the innovative crypto wallet and investments from other leading crypto companies like Bitmain. We are looking forward to exploring the next steps in how Opera will leverage its massive ecosystem and technical competencies to create exponential value for its user base and the greater blockchain space.""

42381298,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94XEv,1538384419,A Bitcoin Mining Moratorium Was Just Avoided in Montana,"Public officials in Missoula County, located in the U.S. state of Montana, have decided to look into new regulations around cryptocurrency mining rather than seek to ban the activity entirely.  As previously reported, miners have been drawn to the region thanks to access to cheap electricity, but local concerns about power rate spikes and noise levels have pushed some residents to call for a moratorium. Many of the recent comments posted online include calls for a moratorium on mining access, citing the prevalence of loud fans and electricity-hungry operations.  Now, according to a message posted to the official website for Missoula County after a meeting on September 27, County Commission staff have begun developing specific rules for miners.  The message explains:  ""On September 27, 2018, the Board of County Commissioners continued the public hearing on cryptocurrency mining that began on June 14. At the continuation of the hearing on September 27, following a staff report and public comments, the Commissioners voted not to adopt interim zoning, and instead directed staff to investigate the development of regulations targeting the impacts of concern such as noise, electronic waste, and energy.""  According to the Missoulian, some of those present at the September 27 meeting pushed for a one-year moratorium, while legal representatives for one mining company challenged the ability of local officials to undertake such a step.  What shape those rules will take remains to be seen, but the focus on noise is likely to be significant, given the prevalence of that specific complaint in many of the recent comments posted online.

42381308,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94XRV,1538380858,"Up 80%: XRP's September Wasn't Just Bullish, It Was Record-Setting","XRP sprang back to life in September despite a relatively bearish broader market.  Over the course of the 30-day period, the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC), dipped a modest 5 percent. Most cryptocurrencies succumbed to the same fate, but some were able to pick up a bid. However, none saw bigger gains than XRP, whose performance in September wasn't just bullish, it was record-setting.  On September 21 alone, the price of XRP shot up more than 75 percent and ended the day with its most trading volume ever recorded on the popular cryptocurrency exchange, Bitfinex.  Further, the explosive move allowed XRP to overtake ETH as the world's second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a feat it last accomplished in December of 2017.  It should be noted that the surge in price perhaps had some speculative backing. The price run-up in XRP was likely catalyzed by anticipation of Ripple's upcoming Swell conference scheduled to set off on Oct. 1. The conference is designed to highlight Ripple's product line and revved up investor interest last year ahead of its inaugural launch.  Still, XRP concluded September boasting a near 80 percent month-over-month price increase to cement it as the best monthly performer out of the world's 25 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.  Monthly Winner  XRP  All-time high: $3.70  Closing price on September 31: $0.59  Rank as per market capitalization: 2  XRP was most productive from Sept 18–22 when its price surged more than 150 percent from $0.27 to a three-month high of $0.69, according to CoinMarketCap. Further, it's high in market capitalization, $24 billion, helped catapult it above ETH as the world's second largest cryptocurrency.  Monthly Chart  Several bullish developments took place on the daily chart over the course of September.  On September 18th, price broke bullish out of a large falling wedge pattern, hinting a bullish reversal was soon to be likely. On the cryptocurrency exchange, Poloniex, the price went on to surge 145 percent from its close of $0.31 on September 18 to a high of $0.77 on Sept 21.  The surge quickly pushed the relative strength index (RSI) value into overbought territory, indicating the bulls were reaching temporary exhaustion. That said, the RSI has since cooled off and its price formed a bullish pennant very similar to that of its structure in mid-December of 2017.  Lastly, the Guppy Multiple Moving Average indicator (GMMA) has flipped green on the daily time frame for the first time in nearly 11 months. That indicator uses groups of moving averages to identify changes in a trend and the indicator flipping green is bullish and considered a buy signal.  The falling wedge breakout, acceptance above the 200-day EMA, pennant formation and green Guppy, all favor a rally in XRP back toward its recent high of $0.77 on Poloniex.  The cryptocurrency might see a ""sell the news"" pullback after the Swell conference. However, the technical bias would remain bullish as long as XRP is trading above its daily higher low of $0.43.  Soon before press time, XRP was trading at $0.58, according to CoinMarketCap.  Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.

42381278,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94VNB,1538366458,"Blockchains Don't Have to Be Perfect, They Just Have to Be Better","Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      There's a moment during almost every presentation I give on blockchain technology's potential to address trust barriers in supply chains where an audience member asks, ""But are we not still trusting the thing/person inputting the data?""  I typically reply with: ""More or less, yes.""  Some see that as contradictory, an invalidation of the argument that blockchains can solve the trust problems that create friction, inefficiency and opacity within the transaction chains that link farmer, miners, parts makers, goods manufacturers, shippers, wholesalers and retailers into our global trading system. Since this is an immutable ledger, they point out, all you're doing is creating an ""immutable garbage-in/garbage-out problem.""  It's a good question and it points to key challenges in making this technology ready for prime time. But this so-called ""last mile"" problem is also something of a straw man. And if we delve into it, it offers a useful framework for understanding the true power of distributed ledgers generally and of blockchains specifically.  First, no one should regard blockchains as promising some kind of ""trustless"" utopia. No such society can ever exist – and if it did it would hardly be a utopia.  The same goes for blockchain ecosystems, even those of bitcoin and other permissionless payment systems whose value exchanges are entirely expressed in a self-contained on-chain native cryptocurrency rather than founded on potentially unreliable off-chain data such as the reports from a factory floor.  These vulnerabilities are not only found in the well-documented problems of centralized exchanges and wallets, but also in the computing devices used to manage crypto assets. Users must trust the manufacturers and all other parties that have touched their devices and their internal parts and components before they took ownership of them. Read up about Intel's Spectre and Meltdown bugs for some insights into how deep this problem goes.  This is the nature of the world. Trust problems are everywhere. Period.  We're just fixing a layer, but a vital one  So, why even bother with blockchain solutions? The answer: Because while they can't fix everything, they do have the potential to improve one important trust problem in society's economic architecture.  If we have a system that reliably records a sequence of changes of state within a particular dataset, doing so in a way that, for all intents and purposes, cannot be altered by any single party without the consensus agreement of everyone else, we can remove one layer of uncertainty from the multifaceted trust equation that lies at the heart of any economic community. I would suggest that's progress.  Let's face it: spreadsheets and enterprise software solutions did not solve all problems of corporate data management. But they did improve it.  And in this case, the particular trust layer we're aiming to improve is not just any old layer. It's arguably the most important: the ledger.  Ledgers are vital to society – their emergence right at the dawn of civilization some 7,000 years ago is no coincidence. In creating a record of transactions that different people could commonly refer to, communities forged a shared truth, an acknowledged foundation upon which to agree to work together and enter economic exchanges. (Note: we're not talking about an absolute truth, but a standard of the truth that's sufficiently accepted by everyone, a consensus view.) In fulfilling this role, ledgers have always been vital to how we solve our mutual mistrust problem.  The problem was that because we also had to trust the centralized ledger-keeper to define that shared truth, another vulnerability was baked into this all-important record-keeping layer. Herein lies the value proposition of decentralization.  In undercutting the power of the centralized ledger-keeper, it makes the shared truth that emerges from the distributed ledger more reliable, more powerful. Ironically, given all this talk of ""trustlessness"" or ""trust minimization,"" the result of any effective blockchain solution should be to strengthen our collective trust in each other, not diminish it.  Spotting patterns of bad behavior  There's a lot you can do with a data log that everyone trusts, including in situations where you can't necessarily trust those inputting the data. You should even be able to use it to hold those very same, potentially untrustworthy data sources to account and weed out the bad ones, for example. That prospect is enhanced when we combine a decentralized, immutable log with other information management tools such as data analytics and artificial intelligence.  Consider a factory worker who has until now been outsmarting everyone else in the supply chain, consistently recording falsehoods about his work output in ways that no one has previously detected. Well, his bad behavior might not be obvious to the naked human eye but it's much harder to hide it from a computer that's running a complex process of network analysis. It will uncover patterns in those large datasets and those patterns will expose him.  Now that they have a sequentially consistent, tamper-proof, commonly accepted log of data inputs, computers can more easily spot anomalies and red flags in data. Not only humans but also devices can be tested in this way, creating feedback loops that iteratively enhance trust in the overall system. This is why Cisco and others are incorporating a blockchain into solutions for proving the reliability of Internet of Things devices.  So, no, a blockchain isn't perfect and a blockchain can contain garbage. But in many cases, it will be better than the status quo. We might even find that, quite often, it's a lot better.
