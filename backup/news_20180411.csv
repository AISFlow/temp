42380535,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gLSr,1523491177,Crypto Tax Support Is Coming Slowly to India,"While the focus may be on the U.S. of late, cryptocurrency tax issues are becoming a global problem.  India, for example, has responded by sending tax notices to crypto traders and investors after a survey found $3.5 billion in transactions may have been performed by citizens over the past 17 months. The country's income tax department has even gone so far as to raid exchanges over suspicions that their customers were evading taxes.  In the midst of all this, local startups are proving proactive, offering services that can help crypto users determine what they owe.  One example comes from tax software startup Cleartax, which recently introduced a crypto tax advisory service in partnership with bitcoin wallet Zebpay, a move that echoes those by other global startups like Coinbase (which recently issued its own cryptocurrency tax calculating tool.)  Demand for the product so far has been strong, according to representatives at Cleartax.  ""The surge in crypto pricing saw a lot of interest from India,"" the representative told CoinDesk. ""We started to receive hundreds of queries about tax implications of these transactions.""  And it's easy to see why. With cryptocurrencies neither legalized nor regulated in the country, taxpayers are struggling to report their crypto profits.  Cleartax continued:  ""There is lack of clarity and anxiety, and several views are floating about how gains from [cryptocurrencies] must be reported in tax returns.""  But Nischint Sanghavi, head of exchange at Zebpay, believes the new tool will help resolve concerns.  ""ClearTax will make taxation related to cryptocurrencies simpler for people so that they can plan their taxes in a better manner,"" Sanghavi said.  Indeed, the advisory service is designed to solve any query related to the taxation on trading and sale of cryptocurrencies, as well as those that might be asked by salaried financial traders and freelancers. Plus, Cleartax has launched certified accountant-assisted tax filing services for investors, helping them report their short- and long-term capital gains from the sale of cryptocurrency.  Answers ahead?  That said, both companies will be limited by India's ongoing regulatory uncertainty over the technology.  The nation's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has been repeatedly issuing warnings to users, holders and traders of cryptocurrencies, stating that it has not given any license to any entity or company to operate or deal with bitcoin or any cryptocurrency, potentially putting a damper on tax disclosures.  ""[With this], the possibility of any formal details on how to tax and report these remains low,"" Archit Gupta, CEO of Cleartax, told CoinDesk.  Yet, bitcoin exchanges in India including Unocoin, Zebpay and CoinSecure are seeking clarifications over tax liabilities for their operations.  Still, Gupta said, even with ""no clear directive"" from the country's income tax department on how cryptocurrency holdings must be reported, users, at least, should pursue paying some form of tax on them.  In the absence of such rules, he said, ""it would be wiser to report these as 'income from other sources' and pay a 30 percent tax on gains from them as opposed to reporting them as capital gains, which would mean these are capital assets.""  And summarizing Gupta's view, a Cleartax representative concluded:  ""While the law is unclear – it is certain that this [cryptocurrency] income must be offered to tax.""

The application was filed in November and granted on Tuesday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). It describes a ""system, method, and program product for processing secure transactions within a cloud computing system,"" with Andrew Laucius, Cem Paya and Eric Winer named as inventors (neither of the Winklevosses is included on the list).  This system uses a combination of common cryptographic techniques, including hash functions and digital signatures. Figures included in the application explain that the system is intended to provide security in a cloud-based digital asset exchange.  And while it doesn't spell it out directly, the patent's language suggests that the proposed system could be used within Gemini's infrastructure.  ""The present invention is an improvement to computer security technology. Computer systems to date have been susceptible to attack, whether the introduction of malicious code or the unauthorized access of information, over external data connections, such as the Internet,"" the application explains, adding:  ""As computing systems increasingly move to distributed computing architectures, such as cloud computing, external data connections are often necessary to the functioning of the computing system.""  Winklevoss IP, LLC, the legal entity that controls the patent, holds a number of trademarks and five patents, including this most recent one.  As CoinDesk has previously reported, the pace of blockchain and cryptocurrency-related patent filings has risen in recent months.

42380528,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gLIn,1523478902,Nasdaq Exchange to Delist Long Blockchain Stock,"Nasdaq will delist the shares of Long Blockchain on Thursday, a move that comes months after the company's price soared following a name change and pivot to blockchain.  The firm, which trades under the ticker LBCC, announced the exchange's decision on Tuesday, sending the stock price down more than 37.14% to about $1.10 as of press time. That represents a notable change of fortune, considering that the price nearly hit $10 after its publicly announced pivot toward cryptocurrency and blockchain services in December.  Long Blockchain warned back in February that it planned to appeal a decision to delist the stock, a process that ultimately proved unsuccessful, according to new statements.  The company said on April 10:  ""The Company appealed this determination and a hearing was held on March 22, 2018. Following this appeal, the Hearings Panel determined to uphold the Staff's decision. Accordingly, trading of the Company's shares will be suspended on the Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on April 12, 2018.""  Long Blockchain did not respond to requests for comment.  In February, Long Blockchain revealed that it was at risk of being delisted – the second such occurrence for the firm, given that it faced similar warnings from Nasdaq in October. Nasdaq's rules require that a listed company's market capitalization remain above $35 million for ten business days in a row – as of press time, LBCC's market capitalization is roughly $11.24 million.  Subsequent disclosures revealed that Nasdaq staffers believed Long Blockchain wasn't being forthright with investors – a determination the company sharply disputed in the same letter, published in February.  ""The notification letter stated that the staff believed that the Company made a series of public statements designed to mislead investors and to take advantage of general investor interest in bitcoin and blockchain technology, thereby raising concerns about the company's suitability for exchange listing,"" the company said at the time. ""The company strongly disagrees with the staff's determination and, accordingly, has appealed to a Hearings Panel.""  According to Tuesday's statement, Long Blockchain plans to continue pressing ahead with its plans, including a previously announced acquisition of a U.K.-based company.  ""Effective April 12, 2018, the Company's common stock will be eligible for trading and quotation on the Pink Current Information tier operated by the OTC Markets Group Inc.,"" the company added.

Brady Tucker, the plaintiff named in the April 10 complaint, said that Chase Bank incorrectly charged him $143.30 in fees and $20.61 in interest stemming from purchases made using his Chase card in January and February.  Brady is being represented by Finkelstein & Krinsk LLP, a San Diego-based law firm.  The bank was one of a number of institutions to stop allowing its customers to make such purchases using their credit cards at the beginning of February.  According to the complaint, prior to pulling the plug on all purchases, the bank began treating such expenditures as ""cash advances"" in January, but did so ""unbeknownst to Chase's cardholders."" Attorneys for the plaintiff alleged that Chase Bank violated the Truth in Lending Act by not disclosing the policy shift.  ""The complete lack of fair notice to Chase's cardholders caused them to unknowingly incur millions of dollars in cash advance fees and sky-high interest charges on each and every crypto purchase,"" the complaint says. Chase did not charge debit card users similar fees.  The plaintiff's lawyers – who are seeking the return of the fees as well as ""additional statutory damages in the aggregate amount of $1 million"" – are seeking class-action status. While the complaint says that the size of the class cannot be determined prior to discovery, it argues that this group likely consists of ""hundreds or thousands of members.""

42380537,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gLVN,1523467820,EU Agencies to Offer €100K Prize at Blockchain Hackathon,"Several European Union agencies will collaborate to facilitate an EU developer event – what they're calling a ""blockathon"" – in June in a bid to explore applications of the tech for intellectual property rights enforcement.  The European Commission has partnered with the European Union Intellectual Property Office and its Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights to launch the Brussels-based hackathon, in which competitors will aim to develop a blockchain-based ""integrated solution to combat counterfeiting,"" the agencies announced on Wednesday.  The successful team will win a €100,000 (about $124,000) prize.  The agencies estimate that around 43 million EU citizens unknowingly purchased counterfeit products in 2017. However, existing preventative systems ""are scattered, often working in silos, and criminal networks use this to their advantage,"" they explained in the statement.  As a result, EUIPO executive director Antonio Campinos said, the agency is turning to blockchain as a potential tool to help combat this issue.  He explained:  ""The EUIPO is determined to explore the potential of blockchain to interconnect systems and ensure security and immutability of data in order to add trust to our legitimate ecosystem for the benefits of citizens, enforcers and companies alike. We believe a strong networked alliance can be built to secure logistics, ensure the authenticity of goods, protect consumers and combat criminal and illegal activities.""  The intellectual property use case for blockchain was established during the early days of the industry, with companies using the bitcoin blockchain to store and track digital certificates of ownership. Since then, a number of startups and projects have sprung up applying the tech to networks that aren't based on bitcoin.  Last year, for example, a project facilitated by the American Society for Composers started developing a platform to track the ownership of legally protected musical works.

As much as $660 million may have been lost as a result of the schemes – Ifan and Pincoin – though these figures could not independently be verified as of press time. Yet the protest outside of Modern Tech's Ho Chi Minh City headquarters, as reported by Tuoi Tre News on Monday, is perhaps reflective of the severity of the situation, which has sparked an official investigation by Vietnamese authorities.  According to the news agency, as many as 32,000 investors may have been affected.  Online materials for both initial coin offerings bear some of the hallmarks of Ponzi schemes, including Ifan, which boasts that it offers ""risk-free activity."" By contrast, Pincoin promises profits of ""up to 40% monthly"" through a range of bonus structures that favor early investors over later ones. It also uses imagery associated with the get-rich-quick subculture, including a Lamborghini.  While questions remain about the ICO organizers and the true extent of the losses, the investigation doesn't seem to be the only official response.  On Wednesday, the office of prime minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc published a directive ""on strengthening the management of Bitcoin-related activities and other similar virtual currency"" to the central bank and securities regulator, originally dated April 4.

The world's largest cryptocurrency by market valuation seems to have found a bottom around the $6,500 mark, having dropped 50 percent in the first quarter – notably, the worst Q1 performance on record. Overall, its safe to say bulls have been struggling to find their feet as indicated by stagnant prices and a narrowing price range.  Yet, speculation is doing the rounds that big Wall Street names (such as Soros and Rockefeller) are set to enter the crypto space. If confirmed, the news could ramp up the bull case, as happened with the advent of bitcoin futures soon before bitcoin's December price peak.  However, history may be on bitcoin's side as well – an analysis of the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index shows BTC tends to perform well in the second quarter.    BTC has registered gains in the second quarter every year – the highest being 1,964 percent in the Q2 2011 when bitcoin jumped from $0.78 to $16.1.  The 131 percent gain reported in Q2 2017 is the second highest on record.  The odds of bitcoin repeating the historical pattern this year are high, as the cryptocurrency is currently oversold, according to the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).  Further, the bullish argument put forward by historical data adds credence to CoinDesk's view that the much-feared ""death cross"" (50-day and 200-day moving average (MA) bearish crossover) could be a ""bear trap.""  Additionally, the weekly chart does show a potential for a minor corrective rally.  Weekly chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows, for the third straight week, the ascending 50-week MA is capping the downside in BTC. This, coupled with the basing pattern around $6,500, as seen on the daily chart (not shown), indicates that bitcoin could soon test resistance lined up around $7,500.  A convincing move above $7,500 could yield a rally to the descending (bear-biased) 10-week MA, currently located at $8,605.  However, in the larger scheme of things, only a close above $11,700 would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change.

The countries, including the U.K., France, Germany, Norway, Spain and the Netherlands, signed a declaration on Tuesday establishing the new group, dubbed the European Blockchain Partnership, according to a release from the European Commission, which led the effort.  The collaboration is aimed to avoid ""fragmented approaches"" to the technology by sharing technical and regulatory expertise among member states, as well as creating ways to promote blockchain applications across the EU-wide Digital Single Market.  Mariya Gabriel, European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, stated that all public services will use blockchain technology in the future, and that the partnership would turn the ""enormous potential of blockchain into better services for citizens"".  As well as enabling member states to work together, the partnership also aims to facilitate the interoperability and implementation of blockchain services.  Gabriel continued:  ""Blockchain is a great opportunity for Europe and member states to rethink their information systems, to promote user trust and the protection of personal data, to help create new business opportunities and to establish new areas of leadership, benefiting citizens, public services and companies.""  The news comes after the EU launched the Blockchain Observatory and Forum in February. Soon after that, the European Commission said it would host a Fintech Lab to foster emerging technologies including blockchain starting from the middle of 2018.

42380524,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gLF1,1523450710,The Wait for Grams: Why Telegram Might Just Cancel Its Public ICO,"The average crypto enthusiast isn't likely to get their hands on grams – Telegram's crypto token – anytime soon.  While half of the ambitious $1.2 billion the messaging giant hoped to raise was supposed to come from an ICO open to public investors, recent SEC filings confirm Telegram has already raised $1.7 billion from two private sales. Now, sources with knowledge of the deal believe the company is likely to scrap its public sale altogether.  The reason? Raising money from the public could be way more trouble than it's worth.  For one, Telegram's blockchain, called the Telegram Open Network (TON), hasn't been built yet. (To be clear, no one has received any grams.) As such, Telegram is selling what basically amounts to IOUs for future grams under the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) framework.  That means – as displayed by the company's SEC filings – the company is selling a security, which cannot be sold to non-accredited investors (except under some exemptions).  ""The regulatory environment is in a weird place with most teams having more questions than answers,"" said Anthony Pompliano, a general partner at Morgan Creek Capital Blockchain. ""If teams can raise their capital goals in private sales, they’ll continue to do so until there is less ambiguity in regulations.”  This appears to be what Telegram is doing, although it's been tough to tell exactly what the founders are thinking since they've said nothing about the ICO or TON, both of which the white paper details will help facilitate a network of faster payments, file-sharing, decentralized privacy, domain registration and more.  Telegram did not respond to a request for comment.  Pompliano told CoinDesk:  “The goal of fundraising is to gain access to capital to allow a team to build a product and company. It appears Telegram has already achieved their goal so there would be no reason to conduct a public sale.""  Tech first  This is especially cogent as it relates to the amount of work a legal public sale would entail.  For one, Telegram would have to go through a know-your-customer and anti-money laundering verification process to be able to sell to everyday investors.  For private, known investors that have been identified plenty of times for investment purposes, the verification work is less cumbersome, but for a store cashier who is investing for the first time, it's more challenging to prove they are who they say they are. And it just has to do it so many more times. This would be no small lift and may not be attractive to a company that already has plenty of money.  Plus, there's already a secondary market for grams whereby small investors are buying the crypto tokens from whales that got into the private sales, according to Alexander Borodich, an alum of the Mail.ru Group, one of Russia's largest tech companies, and an angel investor passed on the opportunity to invest in Telegram's ICO.  As such, he said it's unclear whether a legit public sale will happen.  The TON technical white paper describes an ongoing token sale that will continue intermittently well into the future. That phase may be a sort of public sale, but one that won't begin until the protocol launches.  And according to Sid Kalla of the Turing Advisory Group, building the product before selling to the public would be that smart thing for Telegram to do.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The private sales were raised at around the top of the market euphoria. For a public valuation to reach back to those levels, the crypto community would need to see something concrete.""  Public opinion  Which is another reason Telegram may discard it's public sale for some time – so it doesn't have to deal with thousands of people's unsolicited opinions.  When a company decides to do a public sale, it introduces complexity into its public relations.  That's why large, publicly traded companies devote whole departments to investor relations, said Stephen Palley of the law firm Anderson Kill. And that's something young startups may not have bandwidth to manage, he said.  ""In this twilight world of ICO crowdfunding, you have a company that's brand new, it's a startup ... You suddenly have thousands — tens of thousands — of people who feel like they are stakeholders,"" Palley continued, adding:  ""Do you really want to manage all those people?""  While Telegram is five years old, it's still a relatively small company that's so far bootstrapped development of its messaging platform from the founders' own pockets, which suggests it doesn't have experience in investor relations.  Kalla agreed, telling CoinDesk, ""Since Telegram is trying to solve several hard technological problems (like sharding, say) there may be inevitable delays and setbacks. The private investors are likely more used to such things than the public at large.""  As much as possible  That said, not everyone agrees that Telegram will scrap its public sale so soon.  ""I see no motivation for Telegram to call off their public sale,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the crypto fund-of-funds BitBull Capital, wrote CoinDesk via a spokesperson. ""They seem dead set on raising as much capital as possible ... Considering they're targeting the mass adoption of their user base, I can't imagine them estranging the masses by canceling the public sale.""  Although, it would help if Telegram offered some insight into when and where this sale would be launched, since crypto enthusiasts keep getting bilked out of money by Telegram-focused phishing attacks.  DiPasquale's sentiment isn't the prevailing one, though.  Even if Telegram needs more money to build, it doesn't seem like it's having trouble soliciting from experienced investors through private sales.  Borodich for one predicts that Telegram will raise more money – to boost the total to $2.5 billion – through another private sale before the end of the year. Another source concurred.  Having said that, because there's been a pullback in the cryptocurrency hype, Kalla said, investors would likely want a lower price point for allocations of grams.  And as such, he said:  ""The only reason I see a public token sale making sense if there is investor demand or pressure or any contractual obligation for liquidity.""

42380530,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gLNp,1523444450,"Cloud Mining Contracts Are Securities, Says Philippines SEC","The Philippines securities watchdog warned that it will regulate cryptocurrency cloud mining contracts in the country under existing securities rules.  In a statement issued Tuesday, the country's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said that cloud mining contracts should be classified as securities, since, when the Howey test is applied, the process was determined to involve a money investment with the expectation of a return of profits.  Cloud mining is a process where investors do not deploy actual mining hardware to earn cryptocurrency, but instead take a stake the mining capacity of a remote facility through a contract, which can sometimes be further exchanged.  According to the Philippines SEC, the decision arose after it observed individuals and firms advertising and soliciting investors inside the country, which the agency is now treating as an unregistered issuance of securities.  As such, the regulator stated that any entity or individuals – including salesmen, brokers, promotors or recruiters – involved with offering cloud mining contracts in the country without registration may be prosecuted and penalized with a sentence of up to 21 years in prison.  The ruling follows the Philippines' toughened stance on activities relating to cryptocurrencies in recent months.  While the securities regulator has been reportedly crafting laws to regulate initial coin offerings, it has also stepped its up efforts to scrutinize cryptocurrency projects that fall under the scope of existing securities rules.  Separately, the country's lawmakers are also weighing in on proposals for tougher penalties on any crime that relates to cryptocurrency, according to a CoinDesk report in March.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,840 on Bitfinex.  However, while the sideways trading is somewhat dull for observers and traders alike, the market may be about to become more exciting.  According to technical theory, the wider the range and the longer the duration of the consolidation zone, the more violent the breakout tends to be.  1-hour chart  The above chart shows, the narrowing price range (represented by the triangle formation) is almost a week old.  The range high is $7,510 and the range low is $6,425. So, bitcoin could see at least a $1,000 dollar move on either side, depending on nature (bullish/bearish) of the breakout.  As of writing, the triangle support is seen around $6,570, while the resistance is lined up at $7,080.  A downside break could mean the potential for a sell-off to $5,500. On the way lower, BTC may find support around the November low of $6,000, as the daily relative strength index (RSI) will likely show oversold conditions by then.  Also note that BTC has created a bear flag (continuation pattern), inside the narrowing price range. A downside break of the flag would signal a continuation of the sell-off from the April 9 high of $7,189 and would open the doors to $6,150 (target as per the measured height method: pole height subtracted from breakdown price).  However, only a convincing break below $6,570 (triangle support, sloping upwards) would revive the bearish view. That said, the bearish flag breakdown could boost the odds of a drop below that level.  On the bull side, an upside break of the triangle may not necessarily bring a $1,000 rally as resistance is lined up at $7,189 – a strong resistance point established by the high volume sell-off. Thus, the bulls need a clear break above $7,189.  View  A potential bear flag breakdown could be considered as a warning the bitcoin is set to move below triangle support seen at $6,570. Acceptance below that level could prompt a drop to $6,000.  If the bulls take charge, a high volume move above $7,189 will likely set the tone for a break above $7,510 (range high) and a rally to $8,100.

42380538,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gLWd,1523437207,Bank of England Eyes Private Blockchain Oversight,"The Bank of England, the U.K.'s central banking authority, is developing a proof-of-concept (PoC) examining how to maintain privacy over a distributed ledger-based network while still allowing a regulatory overview of the data.  Partnering for the project with Chain, a blockchain startup that develops infrastructure protocols, the Bank of England released a paper on Wednesday setting out how it is exploring how to maintain a high level of data privacy among participants over a distributed network, while at the same time facilitating transactions of different financial assets.  The ideal scenario, as pictured by the central bank, would be to design ""a distributed ledger system in such a way that transactions remain private whilst keeping all data shared across the network, and at the same time maintaining a regulatory view of all transactions.""  The PoC – which is aimed to build academic understanding, not as a practical solution – offers a window into the thinking of the U.K.'s central bank in advancing distributed ledger technology (DLT) development for existing business functions, while avoiding complete concealment of transactions from the authorities.  The paper comes just several days after the Bank of England released a plan to push a DLT solution as the basis for the next generation of its real-time gross settlement system, and for which the bank is currently testing a proof-of-concept.  That said, the primary hurdle, according to the central bank, is scalability, which is one of the top trade-offs as the institution considers its move towards the DLT system.  While arguing that the ideal scenario is ""theoretically possible,"" the Bank of England stressed that the technology is still at a very nascent stage.  ""The trade-offs would still need to be further explored, especially with respect to scalability, speed of transaction processing and risks around the security of the cryptographic techniques employed,"" the bank concluded.

In its latest update released on Tuesday, the site has now formally banned individual stores on its platform from providing services related to initial coin offerings (ICOs), such as technological development, marketing, and business proposal writing, among others.  Effective starting from April 17, the new rules also extend the platform's existing self-regulatory scope from a previous ban on the sale of individual virtual currencies to now any service or product that derives from a blockchain technology, including crypto commodities like CryptoKitties.  Further, the existing restriction on selling cryptocurrency mining devices and offering mining tutorials remains unchanged.  Citing the notable clampdown on ICOs by the People's Bank of China last September, Taobao stated that stores that violate the new rules by continuing offering these services will be punished.  Notably, various services related to ICOs have remained active among individual stores on Taobao after the PBoC ban last year, some of which knowingly helped ICO projects draw up white papers with fake information.  Currently searching by the term ""white paper"" in Chinese characters could still lead to stores that offer white-paper copywriting services for blockchain and ICO fundraising activities. However, the term used by these stores has been slightly disguised and is rephrased as ""I.CO.""

42380533,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gLMZ,1523419228,Bitcoin Dust: What It Is and Why You Should Get Rid of It,"Imagine having a $100 bill in your pocket. Now, imagine $100 worth of pennies.  Notice the difference?  Bitcoin isn't without its irritating kinks, and tiny bitcoin pieces called ""dust"" are among the lesser-known. As the analogy above shows, the bitcoin protocol sometimes needs to generate tiny output coins when users send bitcoin back and forth, coins so small in value they require more fees to spend than they're actually worth.  But since blockchain room is limited and small value transactions, say $0.01, still can often take up just as much room as larger transactions, too many of these tinier coin pieces can lead to performance issues in the system as a whole.  In the past, dust wasn't necessarily problem for bitcoin users. The story changed, however, as fees grew higher than ever late last year, making smaller value transactions much more expensive to send. In short, some developers argue the time is ripe to get rid of bitcoin dust now that fees are down again.  Decentralized applications developer Greg Slepak, like many others in the space, is thinking ahead to a time where bitcoin adoption and transaction rates increase - something that might or might not happen.  If that does happen, the argument goes, it's more profitable to move these tiny data pieces while fees are relatively low, especially if a user has collected a lot of them.  Slepak, for one, isn't about to take any chances.  He told CoinDesk:  ""That time might not come again.""  Extinguishing dust  To get rid of this ""dust,"" users need to ""consolidate"" their all their dust ""transaction outputs"" into one. That just means sending one transaction that effectively lumps them together.  Going back to our original analogy, it's similar to trading in a bunch of pennies, nickels and dimes for a fresh dollar bill. How (and whether) users can identify and get rid of dust, depends on their wallet, however.  Slepak recommends Electrum, a long-standing simplified payment verification (SPV) wallet, that validates transactions with less data, and is thus common to use on mobile devices.  A user can select a number of ""change addresses"" holding dust, then select the ""send from"" button to create one transaction consolidating all these little dust particles into a single transaction output.  Some wallets might not offer this granular level of control, especially if they're custodial wallets like Coinbase, which essentially manage these sort of details themselves behind the scenes - choosing whether to keep or get rid of dust.  Bitcoin wallet Blockchain and offers a variation of this feature as well.  Bad for privacy?  One caveat, though, is extinguishing dust in this way can reveal more about your financial history than you might like.  Say you have dust collected in a number of different accounts. In cryptocurrencies, it's best-practice for financial privacy not to reuse bitcoin addresses. (Though not everyone actually does this since it's not very convenient.)  If this the case, consolidating dust from several accounts at once can compromise a user's privacy. Since the blockchain is public, it's easy to tell that all these transactions at least might have come from the same user. This is especially the case if a user has gone through a know-your-customer (KYC) filters at a bitcoin exchange, where users are required to confirm their identity, as a way to curb financial crime in the cryptocurrency world.  If one user's address is tied to a real-world identity in this way, then all the other addresses storing dust in the consolidation transaction will suddenly be as well.  ""It's like saying, 'Yes indeed, and these other addresses belong to me, too,'"" Slepak remarked.  ""This is why people should use Monero instead,"" he added, pointing to a cryptocurrency that is more private by default and where this sort of privacy managing wouldn't be an issue.  These privacy concerns really depend, though. If a user's dust is already all tied to the same account, then the dust is already linked together anyway. So, mashing the dust together into one transaction, in this case, won't harm a user's privacy.  So, while Slepak thinks that this is the time people should move to stamp out their dust ""if they don't want to lose those funds,"" he said, they should only do so if such ""privacy implications"" don't bother them.  Bigger obstacles ahead  On the other hand, Blockchain data software engineer, Antoine Le Calvez, one of the blockchain's most avid data trackers, argues that dust levels have already been decreasing by quite a bit.  That's thanks to bigger bitcoin businesses. Because of the high fees earlier this year, larger bitcoin companies were driven to adopt more efficient transaction technologies - including getting rid of dust - to reduce fees.  ""Coinbase cleaned their wallet. And they were quite a massive contributor,"" Le Calvez told CoinDesk. ""Since the end of the consolidation, there's been less dust created.""  Users can consolidate transactions to potentially save money in the future - if they so desire. But bitcoin companies might have a larger-scale impact on overall dust levels - as they already have.  But, just like Slepak, Le Calvez is thinking about the future. Fees might get worse if bitcoin ever gains more attention on a larger scale. This could happen if and when the Lightning Network, trumpeted as the future of bitcoin payments, since they're cheaper and gives bitcoin more scale, actually gains traction.  ""I think that anything that results in more usage of the blockchain can lead to fees that are higher than the dust itself,"" Slepak said.  Le Calvez added that ""it's easy"" to clean up dust when payments aren't coming in at such a high volume, like they are today. That might not be the case if and when the level of transaction ""heats up"" again.  He stated:  ""The real test, though, will be the next run up.""

42380543,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gLcv,1523412016,Bank of America: Bitcoin Bubble Is Already Popping,"A team of Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) researchers is arguing that bitcoin is one of the ""greatest asset price bubbles in history.""  In a note released Sunday, the team led by chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett went so far as to categorize the current market, which has seen a 60 percent correction so far in 2017, as a bubble that is already popping, Bloomberg reported.  The bank published a chart comparing bitcoin with famous financial manias: the Mississippi Company and South Sea Company in the 18th century, gold, the U.S. stock market in 1929 and the Dutch tulip bubble in 1637.  A published chart shows that the bitcoin bubble has the greatest asset price appreciation by a significant margin. At its peak, bitcoin's price was nearly 60 times what it had been three years before. Dutch tulip prices only rose by a factor of around 40, the researchers said.  According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, bitcoin peaked at $19,783 on Dec. 17. At the time of writing, it trades at $6,835.  BAML's chart shows the aftermath of famous historical bubbles as well as their run-up, indicating that once prices crash, they remain at their new, lower levels.  The same has not proved true of bitcoin so far, however. The recent bitcoin bubble is not history's - or event bitcoin's - greatest bubble. The price of bitcoin shot up 120-fold in 2010 and 2011, to around $11, before crashing. Its rise in 2013 and 2014 was also much steeper than the recent bull market.  That being said, comparisons between the 2017 bubble and previous ones are unfair. The 2017-2018 bubble had more capital invested in the market than either 2010-2011 or 2013-2014.  The same factor complicates comparisons between bitcoin and the stock market. For example, in August 1929, the New York Stock Exchange's listings were worth well over $1 trillion, adjusted for inflation.
