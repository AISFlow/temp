With the market recovery, the digital asset had begun to return some green weekly closes. That is until the market correction, and bitcoin lost about $4,000 off the top of its value. This resulted in a weekly close for the prior week, and even though it looked like a recovery might be on the horizon, bitcoin has recorded another red weekly close. Two Red Closes Within the last couple of weeks, bitcoin had seen some incredible movements that had returned faith in the market.

Bitcoin Declines; Ether Falls, Although Investor Interest Is Reappearing  By James Rubin  Bitcoin remained firmly above $21,000 on Monday afternoon as investors continued their anxious fretting over coming remarks by U.S. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the same macroeconomic uncertainty that has engulfed markets of all stripes for almost a year.  The largest cryptocurrency in market value was recently trading at about $21,100, down roughly a percentage point over the past 24 hours. BTC has dropped 10% over the past five days after the release of July's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting suggesting the bank would maintain its current inflation prescription of 75-basis point, interest rate hikes. Powell is widely expected to signal the central bank's intent in a speech at the Fed's annual Economic Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, later this week.  ""Bitcoin momentum has evaporated as risky assets soften ahead of the Jackson Hole Symposium,"" Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya wrote in an email. ""Too much of Wall Street expects inflation to take two years or longer for the Fed to get inflation under control.""  Yet, Moya added that bitcoin weakness was ""not matching the selling pressure hitting stocks ... a sign that investors are not ready to see prices retest the June lows.""  Ether offered a two-pronged tale on Monday. The second-largest crypto by market cap was recently changing hands below $1,600, a more than 2% drop that left ETH at its lowest level in nearly three weeks amid investor concerns that venture firm Jump Capital was dumping the token. But as CoinDesk's Jimmy He wrote, a report by data provider Kaiko found that money was flooding back into the ETH futures market on Monday. “As the price dipped below $1,600, we observed a significant spike in open interest,” Kaiko noted.  Despite ether's recent drop, Arca Chief Investment Officer Jeff Dorman remained optimistic about its future pricing, saying in his weekly Two Satoshi newsletter that worries about it were overblown. While “long ETH” is certainly a crowded and telegraphed trade, it is likely still one of the best risk/reward investment opportunities in digital assets right now,"" Dorman wrote.  Other altcoins were largely in the red on average trading volume, with SOL and SAND recently off more than 6% and 5%, respectively.  Equity markets that have largely correlated with crypto prices suffered throughout the day from the same concerns plaguing crypto markets. The tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 both sank over 2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) nearly as much as markets returned to the more risk-averse climate from earlier in the summer.  Moya noted that bitcoin could drop below $20,000 support if the dollar, which has been gaining strength, continues on this course. ""Bitcoin may have some defending the $20,000 level, but it may be tough for that level to hold if king dollar continues to appreciate leading up to Fed Chair Powell’s speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium,"" he wrote.

Ether fell 25% over the past week following a nearly month-long rise. DOGE and SHIB fell over 15% on Monday, while tokens powering layer 1 blockchains Avalanche, Polkadot and Solana saw declines of as much as 12%.  In a Telegram broadcast on Monday, Singapore-based QCP Capital blamed two factors, the U.S. central bank's continued monetary hawkishness, a possible Jump Capital sell-off, for the slide in the absence of a specific trigger, adding it expected markets to continue to trade sideways over the coming weeks.  “Fed officials have been actively pushing back on the dovish narrative in the market,” QCP traders said. “This has led to equities stalling and trading lower, yields drifting higher and [the U.S. dollar] rallying across the board.”  “Chatter about Jump dumping a large amount of ETH ahead of the Merge has contributed to the rush to take profit on ETH longs,” the firm added, referring to prominent crypto trading firm Jump Crypto.  QCP traders added they saw “significant profit taking” that ultimately led to liquidations of levered long positions that built up over a strong month-long rally, the effects of which were seen “especially in ether” which has rallied 130% in the past month.  The firm said it would be watching Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole economic symposium in Wyoming Friday for its potential impact on markets.  After the release last Wednesday of the Fed’s July minutes, the consensus among central bank observers is that Powell will signal additional, steep interest rate hikes in his symposium remarks, with some traders stating that bitcoin technicals have flipped bearish and that the largest crypto by market cap could see declines ahead, as CoinDesk reported, with some traders stating that bitcoin technicals have flipped bearish and that the  Important events  8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(12:30 a.m. UTC): Jibun Bank manufacturing PMI (August preliminary)  CoinDesk TV  In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:  Markets Look Ahead to Fed’s Economic Symposium, a Sector-by-Sector Breakdown of Digital Asset Performance  The crypto price slide last week suggested a bearish trend to analysts.

42374023,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWn5l,1661206209,"Ethereum Merge Drama Continues as Traders Pile Out, Then Back In","For the past month, crypto markets have been buffeted by speculation over the potential impact of Ethereum's coming Merge – a major milestone for the second-largest blockchain. A key question is how the shift to a proof-of-stake system, which is supposed to be faster and more energy-efficient than the current proof-of-work protocol, will affect prices for ether (ETH) and related digital assets.  With the event now expected next month, the market narrative keeps twisting.  According to a weekly report from the data provider Kaiko, ether’s steep price plunge on Friday brought a swift decline in open interest on derivatives – contracts that traders used to make leveraged bets on the cryptocurrency’s future price. Many traders had their derivatives trades liquidated, or wiped out due to margin calls, according to Kaiko.  But on Monday, money flooded back into the ETH futures market, Kaiko found.  “As the price dipped below $1,600, we observed a significant spike in open interest,” Kaiko wrote.     Ether perpetual funding rates  There has also been plenty of movement in funding rates on ether perpetual contracts, which are similar to futures contracts on commodities but without expiration dates. The funding rates recovered to near-neutral levels after dipping alongside the token’s price.  “When combined with the spike in open interest we observed this morning, it seems these new positions in ETH futures are biased long and investors are bullish at these price levels,” Kaiko wrote.  Trading volumes flipped  Separately, ether’s share of the weekly, combined trading volume of ether and bitcoin hit 57%, the highest since 2018. This trading activity exceeded the previous peak of 55% during the May 2021 crypto sell-off.  “The main driver of ETH trading activity in July has been increased optimism around the Merge and an improvement of global risk sentiment. However, last week’s sell-off across markets confirms that ETH remains a higher beta play,” Kaiko wrote.  Proof-of-work Ethereum fork?  There’s ample speculation that many Ethereum miners might try to keep supporting a proof-of-work, which the blockchain currently uses, as does Bitcoin. Ethereum Classic and ETHPOW – based on a new, theoretical fork that might take place – have been touted as possible choices as the Merge approaches.  According to Kaiko, the ethereum classic (ETC) token has outperformed tokens of other forks, such as bitcoin cash (BCH), as well as ETH and BTC for the year to date. However, ETC recently retraced gains, falling over 20% over the past week.  ETHPOW’s price, meanwhile, has fallen over 60% from a high of $140 at the beginning of August to around $50. The token’s daily volume dropped 66% after its first week going live, as traders’ appetites fizzled out.  While some Ethereum Merge concerns such as further delays, an unsuccessful transition and proof-of-work fork competitors remain amongst traders, Arca Research Analyst Nick Hotz says that most of the concerns are overblown.  “Three Ethereum testnets (Ropsten, Sepolia and Goerli) and nine ’shadow forks’ have merged successfully,” Hotz wrote. “Many of the hiccups seen in testing arose from the fact that these tests were not the real thing, whereas the actual Ethereum merge probably would have gone smoothly.”  Once Ethereum reaches a specific total terminal difficulty (TTD), or amount of computing power dedicated to the network, the Merge will happen. Right now, the Merge is estimated to be around Sept. 15.  “When the TTD is reached, Ethereum will switch to proof-of-stake, regardless of any hiccups,” Hotz wrote.

42374015,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWmwx,1661205319,Bank Run at NFT Lender BendDAO Prompts Attempt to Avert Another Liquidity Crisis,"NFT-collateralized crypto loans platform BendDAO looked to right itself Monday after lurching through a nearly disastrous liquidity crisis over the weekend, a situation that underscored the pitfalls of letting people borrow crypto money against their Bored Apes non-fungible tokens.  BendDAO – from a distance – looks like an old-school bank: Some customers deposit money into the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, which loans the money out, giving depositors a cut of the interest payments. Those loans are backed by collateral but with a crypto-quirk: that collateral is pictures of monkeys, pixelated heads and other pricey non-fungible tokens.  Over the past few days, depositors fearful the lender would fail withdrew their assets en masse, sparking a bank run that drained BendDAO’s reserves to a Sunday low of five ether (ETH) from more than 10,000 wrapped ETH. That happened after dozens of BendDAO loans were in the platform's danger zone at the end of last week, meaning the NFTs held as collateral were at risk of being liquidated.  Read more: Many Bored Ape NFTs Are in Danger of Getting Liquidated as Borrowed Money Comes Back to Bite  The pressure partially abated Monday as some depositors came back to the platform and other borrowers repaid their NFT-backed loans. That momentary relief gave BendDAO’s community a chance to grapple with the faulty liquidation mechanics that sparked DeFi’s latest lending drama. They’re now slated to approve a series of changes to how BendDAO runs.  BendDAO attempts to shield itself from defaulted borrowers by auctioning off their NFT collateral for ETH. It's hard-coded to accept “only bids that make the DAO whole,” explained Nikolai Yakovenko, who runs NFT price website DeepNFTValue. That way, the protocol will be able to pay back depositors.  The trouble arises when no one is willing to bid at BendDAO’s prices. Cratering NFT markets and jitters about tying up assets in BendDAO’s two-day auction window proved toxic this weekend. BendDAO was left with the prospect of holding highly illiquid ape JPEGs instead of the ETH it needed.  “They basically don't allow the DAO to be leveraged in any way whatsoever,” Yakovenko said. “They don’t allow the DAO to take a loss on anything, which as a result makes them take a loss on everything.”  Next steps  “We are sorry that we underestimated how illiquid NFTs could be in a bear market when setting the initial parameters,” BendDAO participants wrote in a proposal that seeks to change how the protocol operates and “build confidence” for ETH depositors.  The proposed changes would see BendDAO gradually lower the liquidity threshold to 70% from its current 95%, shorten a liquidation amnesty window from two days to four hours and increase interest rates to incentivize more ETH deposits and repayments.  BendDAO’s 48-hour amnesty program gives borrowers time to rescue their NFT by repaying the loan and a penalty.

42421125,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZUar,1661204086,Former CFTC Chair: Here's How SEC and CFTC Can Work Together to Regulate Crypto,"Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Timothy Massad said current gaps in crypto regulation can be filled if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the CFTC come together to form a self-regulatory organization (SRO).  Massad, now a research fellow at Harvard University’s School of Government, told CoinDesk TV on Monday that as it stands now, “neither agency has the power” to regulate cryptocurrency.  ""There is the gap. There's a gap with respect to regulation of what I would call the cash market for crypto assets, which are not securities,"" he said.  The SEC oversees the securities markets including stocks and bonds while the CFTC’s purview is in commodities futures such as agriculture and metals. The CFTC has taken a role in crypto because exchanges such as the CME have active futures markets in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). Meanwhile, the SEC has taken action against crypto firms because it deems some tokens as securities based on the way they are marketed to the public.  Read more: SEC Will Need to Prove Tokens Are Securities in Coinbase Insider-Trading Case, Legal Expert Says  The issue is determining which U.S. agency regulates cash markets – such as buying crypto on exchanges like Coinbase (COIN) or Kraken. Several bills in the U.S. Congress are trying to address this question of how crypto is regulated. But Massad sees the better path in the two agencies joining together in an SRO.  “The SEC and the CFTC create a joint self-regulatory organization that they would oversee and they would pass on its rules,” he said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.”  Self-regulatory agencies are commonplace in traditional finance. For example, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), overseen by the SEC, creates and enforces rules on brokers and broker-dealers.  Massad, who led the CFTC for nearly three years during the Obama administration, said an SRO for crypto “might be a way to develop standards for this market.” It would also keep regulators from getting “bogged down” on the longstanding debate of whether something is deemed a security or a commodity.  Like other SROs, it would be paid for by the industry being regulated, Massad said. In addition, the proposed committee’s standards would aim to be vastly different from the self-regulatory efforts the crypto industry has attempted, which Massad noted “are much too weak.”  The Senate Agriculture Committee has introduced a bipartisan bill that would give “exclusive jurisdiction” to the CFTC. Essentially, the bill would allow the market regulator to define what is and is not considered a “digital commodity.”  Some in the industry propose having the crypto spot markets regulated by the CFTC. But Massad agrees with those who think the agency would not be fully able to handle it alone.  “The CFTC was underfunded when I was there,” Massad said. “We didn’t have the resources to do things that we really needed to do.”  Read more: Crypto Lending Platforms 'Should Be Regulated': Former CFTC Chairman",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/22/former-cftc-chair-heres-how-sec-and-cftc-can-work-together-to-regulate-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/45a10f9cb91d8d22d79416a6bce8a1a80611941d-1415x1061.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374018,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWmzT,1661203546,Inside the $3B DeFi Exploit of Acala's Crypto Platform,"When the decentralized-finance platform Acala was attacked on Saturday, allowing the perpetrators to mint what was technically $3 billion worth of its aUSD stablecoins, a natural question to ask was: Didn’t Acala audit their code?  Yes, the Polkadot-based protocol certainly did. But the exploit involved a misconfiguration in one of Acala’s liquidity pools – the backbone of decentralized exchanges (DEXes), where cryptocurrencies are swapped according to a math equation instead of a conventional order book – which originate from another project entirely, the Honzon protocol. And that allowed 3.02 billion new aUSD stablecoins to be created, which drove their price down dramatically from their intended $1 each.  “We didn’t perform an exhaustive review of the Honzon protocol. We stated at the time that additional reviews were required to fully investigate issues we identified,” Nick Selby, vice president of the software assurance practice at Trail of Bits, said in an interview with CoinDesk. That company was one of several firms that audited Acala’s smart contracts last year.  In a statement to CoinDesk, Bryan Chen, co-founder and CTO of Acala, explained that multiple audits were performed with several top audit firms other than Trail of Bits. One such firm was Security Research Labs (SRLabs), a cybersecurity consultancy and research company.  “All code involved in the aUSD error mints was mature code that had been audited several times and also battle tested on Karura, our canary network on Kusama,"" said Chen. (Kusama is an experimental development environment for Polkadot-related projects.)  Bette Chen, co-founder and CEO of Acala, also added some clarity to the situation by emphasizing that audits don’t detect parameter misconfigurations.  ""A parameter configuration is not part of a code change. For example, when the liquidation ratio is changed, there is no new audit required; a governance vote can update parameters. The code itself, however, should have prevented the misconfiguration, which is not picked up by internal and external audits,” she said in a statement to CoinDesk.  In other words, the protocol code ought to have caught the error in the parameter configuration – but it didn’t.  Read more: In Crypto, Base Layer Security Isn’t Enough  About 2.97 billion of the erroneously minted 3.02 billion aUSD was subsequently recovered, and approximately 1.29 billion aUSD was burnt after an urgent governance vote. The Acala community also voted to burn the remaining 1.68 billion aUSD in a later vote. Here’s how it all unraveled.  iBTC/aUSD liquidity pool  Interlay, a decentralized stablecoin network, recently launched InterBTC (iBTC) – a wrapped bitcoin token. Wrapped tokens are synthetic (or tokenized) versions of crypto assets that are not native to the blockchains they exist on. These iBTC tokens debuted on two Polkadot DeFi platforms: Acala and Moonbeam.  Read more: What Are Liquidity Pools?  On Aug. 4, Acala announced an iBTC/aUSD liquidity pool. The pool was set to launch around Aug. 13. Members of the Acala community were encouraged to contribute iBTC and aUSD to the pool in order to establish liquidity. These liquidity providers would subsequently be rewarded with interlay (INTR) and acala (ACA) tokens.  Attack of the ‘error mints’  The iBTC/aUSD liquidity pool was launched on schedule on Aug. 13. Soon afterward, the error mints were initiated. The root cause was a protocol misconfiguration that distributed rewards in aUSD instead of INTR and ACA.  Within minutes, an Acala contributor picked up on the activity and notified the community. Shortly thereafter, the Acala community held a governance vote which authorized halting Acala Swap, Acala’s DEX protocol.  Further investigation revealed the Honzon protocol misconfiguration as the root cause of the error mints. Subsequent votes were carried out resulting in an agreement to pause Honzon and ultimately rectify the situation.  As a stablecoin, aUSD typically trades at an approximate 1:1 ratio with the U.S. dollar. The value of aUSD fell from about $1.03 to $0.009 after the attack.  Read more: DeFi Platform Acala’s Stablecoin Falls 99% After Hackers Issue 1.3B Tokens  Tracking the culprits  By Aug. 15, Acala had traced all error mint-related transactions to 16 wallets. The total amount of aUSD in these wallets was initially estimated to be around 1.29 billion. An additional 4.3 million remained unclaimed in the iBTC/aUSD reward pool.  Two days later, on Aug. 17, the Acala community conducted a second transaction-tracing analysis. They discovered that a total of 3.022 billion aUSD (and not 1.29 billion as originally estimated) had been erroneously minted and claimed (as reward money) by liquidity providers. Fortunately, an additional 1.68 billion aUSD was also recovered, bringing total recovered funds to 2.97 billion out of the total 3.02 billion.  The community passed a referendum to burn the 1.29 billion aUSD recovered on Aug. 15. This partially restored the token’s peg, which currently sits at about $0.80. Another governance vote took place on Aug. 20 to burn the remaining 1.68 billion aUSD.  After the Acala exploit  Acala has clearly identified the aUSD Honzon liquidity pool protocol as the source of the minting vulnerability. The asset paired with aUSD within the pool in question, iBTC, was not affected, neither was its code a part of the problem. Interlay (creator of iBTC) has distanced itself from the debacle.  “There is one important thing to set straight – it was not an iBTC hack … Interlay/iBTC have not been compromised. The incident has not jeopardized Interlay as a network, nor iBTC as a product, in any way. All system operations have been and remain fully functional,” Alexei Zamyatin, co-founder and CEO of Interlay, told in a CoinDesk interview.  The full extent of Acala’s error mints is still being investigated. In a statement, Bette Chen said:  “We continue to work with our partners and contributors to trace aUSD erroneously minted by 16 wallet addresses. Results will continue to be published in a transparent manner, and the community can continue to collectively formulate proposals to resolve the erroneously minted aUSD. We greatly appreciate everyone’s patience and support.""  UPDATE (Aug. 23, 9:58 UTC): Corrects spelling on Moonbeam in 10th paragraph.

42411402,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNYFx,1661200502,Will Taylor Swift Ever Issue a Music NFT?,"I’ve always wondered what would’ve happened had Taylor Swift’s first re-recorded album, “Fearless (Taylor's Version),'' been released as a non-fungible token (NFT).  If you’re unfamiliar, in 2019, preeminent pop-country musician Taylor Swift declared war against record executive Scooter Braun. He was withholding the masters (i.e., original recordings of her songs) of her first six studio albums, so she fought back by re-recording her own songs.  Aziz Alangari is a marketing associate at Wachsman, a PR firm.  She first re-published her second studio album, “Fearless,” through her record company and asked fans to listen again on streaming platforms. The move was a way to declare her independence from Braun – and as an artist.  This is a classic tale of the power imbalance in the music industry, and goes far in explaining the most talked about use case for music NFTs: connecting fans and artists. With crypto, middlemen like Braun have much less power over artists like Swift from the start.  NFTs are like signatures for digital media, etched onto a blockchain. They’re a way to conclusively show who owns what online, and also give a unique digital identity to infinitely reproducible files.  “Taylor’s Version” is more or less identical to Braun’s original, except for its purpose. Swift urged fans to rebuy or stream music they may have already owned, because she was waging war against an exploitative music industry under the veneer of being personally victimized by Braun.  And it worked. “Taylor’s Version,” according to Billboard, earned more ""album units"" in its first week of release than Braun’s version had in total that year. It became the first re-recorded album to ever reach number one on the Billboard 200 chart.  Swift, like many modern-day celebrities, has a lot of influence over her fans. Her ability to sell albums and successfully advertise products has made her a multi-millionaire. But now, decades into the social media age, there’s a growing realization that the relationship between celebrities and followers is parasocial and possibly exploitative.  NFTs stand as a key way to level the playing field between fans and artists. They enable people to directly finance artistic production, as well as share in the wealth generated whenever an album is streamed or purchased. When she announced “Red (Taylor’s Version),” Taylor mentioned in a tweet that “Red is about to be mine again, but it has always been ours.” Has it, though?  See also: The Financialization of Fandom | Opinion  Swifties, who streamed the 10-minute version of her hit “All Too Well” non-stop, earned absolutely nothing. I was one of them. To call a spade a spade, there’s some overlap between Swifties and TSA dogs: They all know they’re not getting paid.  If “Taylor’s Version” was released as an NFT, she’d be able to share that money with her fans while still achieving her goal of regaining control of her music, opening the door to a financially incentivized fanbase. But why should she?  Getting political  The reality is that Swift, and most artists, don’t need to share earnings with their fans, because why would you pay a TSA dog? They’re doing their job well. They’re happy. They’re very, very loyal. In fact there’s an overabundance of loyalty that, in an artist’s view, is unlikely to become scarce in the near future. Why fix it if ain’t broke, right?  Even if we operate under the assumption that Taylor Swift isn’t a greedy cash-grabber and wants to reward her followers, there’s still a reputational cost for her to enter the NFT space. It would be a burden for her PR team to tediously explain how smart contracts work or why they’re important.  It would also require her to dip her toes into an area within politics that’s foreign to her, such as the overblown environmental concerns and the bizarre idea that right-leaning crypto bros represent the entire crypto community. We’re talking career self-sabotage, if not suicide.  Despite Swift's absence from public discourse on crypto in general, it would be naive to assume that music NFTs haven’t crossed her mind. She probably saw a number of celebrity friends endorse crypto in the preceding year’s bull run.  And even if she hadn't head of NFTs in 2019, it's improbable that she's still ignorant. As of recently, her current record label purchased a Bored Ape. Not to mention Bella Hadid, one of Swift's closest friends, launching her own NFT collection. Even if Swift had not heard about NFTs in 2019, she almost certainly has now.  But the political factors alone make for a good business case not to move forward with it.  See also: A New Era of Media Begins With Tokenization | Opinion (2020)  In fairness to Swift, not publishing NFTs was the easiest way to go. If she just wanted to sell music and share her success with fans, why should that require her to prove that liberals can enjoy the benefits of crypto just as much as conservatives? It might ""get lost in translation,"" or could be seen as ""ask[ing] for too much.""  Swift, at the time of releasing “Taylor’s Version,”was attacking the status quo in the entertainment industry where distributors and producers still exercise outsized control. Though a cynic may say she was merely portraying herself as a victimized girlboss who generated sales under the veneer of independence, altruism and feminism.  Real rewards  Today, there’s a viable way for pop stars to take a principled stand against the traditional music industry: introducing the financialization of fandom. i.e., using crypto for how it was meant to be used. Is it surprising that that hasn’t happened yet in a meaningful way? Not really, considering the people we’re talking about.  Celebrities are not absent from the crypto space, they’re just in it for the wrong reasons. Madonna purchasing a $300,000 Bored Ape NFT is no different from her purchasing a Birkin bag and Steve Aoki’s personal collection of 10 Bored Ape NFTs is not contributing to mainstream adoption.  It stuns me how celebrities are handed all of these investment opportunities without caring about mass adoption. They’re being handed a first-class ticket to the metaverse, and the people they’re bringing onboard basically end up underwater.  I was at the NFT LA conference in March 2022 and one of the panelists was Charlie Sheen, the actor, who had absolutely no idea what he was talking about.  Macy Gray, the Grammy-nominated R&B singer who dabbles with music NFTs herself, said verbatim on another panel that she “does not know much about crypto.” Some are better at parroting talking points, but few understand the seismic shift crypto could represent for art.  People do, in fact, say all’s well that ends well. At this point, it’s hard to believe most celebrities have not been introduced to crypto. But do artists like Taylor Swift have a strong disbelief in the concept of smart contracts and music NFTs, or do they simply not care?  I suspect it’s a mix of both. Do Swifties know deep down that they deserve some level of compensation for blasting “Taylor’s Version” 24/7, or are they content with seeing a girlboss succeed?  See also: NFTs, Celebrities and Perverse Deal-Making | Opinion  I guess we’ll never know for sure why Swift turned a blind eye on NFTs but I suspect, or dare I say predict, seeing the mass commercialization of crypto and NFTs by celebrities once the dust settles and the political collateral damage is no longer a factor.

42374019,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWn1z,1661200286,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Falls as Markets Await Fed Chair Powell’s Comments,"Price Action  BTC Trims Price Ahead of Economic Summit; Macroeconomic Uncertainty  Bitcoin (BTC) sold off mildly in Monday trading, declining 1.8% on average trading volume. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose 3% over the weekend, and has settled in near the $21,000 mark after plunging Friday.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was recently down 2% on Monday, following an increase of 0.58% over the weekend.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  All eyes appear focused on global, macroeconomic developments and the impact that both growth and inflation will have on crypto assets. Investors will be listening to comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell during the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's Economic Policy Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, later this week for hints of what the central bank will do at its September meeting.  The symposium, which begins Friday, is expected to provide insight into the pace at which Powell expects the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to increase rates for the remainder of the year.  According to the CME FedWatch tool, the probability of a 75 basis point interest rate increase has risen to 54.5% from 47% one day prior.  In global economic news, Hong Kong’s annual inflation rate for July increased to 1.9%, from 1.8% the previous month, but below consensus estimates of 2%.  Traditional markets sold off as well, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), S&P 500 and tech heavy Nasdaq composite falling 1.9%, 2.1% and 2.6%, respectively.  Energy markets saw crude oil increase .3%. Natural gas was 4% higher, with the increase likely driven by supply shortage concerns. Traditional safe haven asset gold recently dropped 0.78%, while copper futures declined 0.3%.  Latest Prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $21,094 −2.0%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,579 −2.9%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 4,137.99 −2.1%      ●Gold: $1,748 per troy ounce +0.0%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.04% +0.05       Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  BTC moves into oversold territory  Monday’s chart shows BTC’s decline into “oversold territory” on multiple indicators. Bitcoin’s RSI fell below 30 during Friday’s 10% price drop, recovering since then to 34.  RSI (relative strength index), is a technical indicator that measures price momentum. Readings above 70 traditionally indicate that an asset is overbought (i.e., overvalued), while readings at 30 or below imply that an asset is oversold (i.e., undervalued).  Bitcoin’s current reading, while slightly above 30, indicates that BTC is undervalued, although the recent price moves have come on lower-than-average, trading volume.. Lower-than-average trading volume can imply a lack of conviction in a trade both now and in the near future. As markets await Fed Chair Powell’s symposium comments on Friday, BTC will likely trade relatively flat on lower volume in the coming days.  BTC’s so-called Bollinger bands also imply that bitcoin is currently undervalued. Bollinger bands measure the moving average for an asset (typically 20 days) and calculate values that are two standard deviations above and below the moving average. A standard deviation is a measurement of the distance from the average. Traditionally, 95% of values fall within two standard deviations of the average.  Traders often view movements outside of two standard deviations as a sign that prices have risen abnormally high or low, and identify this signal when BTC prices move outside their Bollinger Bands. BTC’s current chart indicates that prices have breached the lower range of their Bollinger Bands, implying that price is oversold.  ETH loses ground to BTC  Ether’s increase relative to BTC has slowed recently. ETH had been surging compared to BTC since July 13 but has declined 9% since a near-term peak over $2,000 on Aug. 13.  As they consider wider macroeconomic uncertainty, traders may also be weighing whether ether’s price has already baked in the full impact of the upcoming Ethereum Merge, which is scheduled for September.  Macro take  Most investors appear to be expecting Powell to signal continued monetary hawkishness. Traditional equity markets sank even more substantially than most cryptos on Monday. In bond markets, the 10-year Treasury bond yield increased beyond 3% for the first time since July. The increase in rates implies that bond buyers require a higher rate of return to lend, and that the FOMC will increase rates 75 basis points to match the past two rate hikes.  Target rate probabilities for the FOMC’s September meeting are now implying a 54.5% chance that rates will increase 75 basis points. A week ago, the probability for a 75 basis point hike was just 39%.  If Powell signals that the FOMC is likely to increase rates by only 50 basis points, both traditional and digital asset prices will likely push higher. The central bank chair commands the stage.

Bitcoin MVRV Triple Ribbon Shows Bearish Signal Formation As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the latest trend in the BTC MVRV triple ribbon may suggest the crypto will observe another local drawdown soon. Before looking at what &apos;MVRV&apos; is, it&apos;s best to first take a look at the two major types of capitalization methods for Bitcoin. The first cap, the usual market cap, is calculated by multiplying each coin in circulation with the current BTC price (or more simply, it&apos;s just the total number of coins in circulation, multiplied by the price). Where the other capitalization model, the &apos;realized cap&apos; differs is that instead of all the coins being weighted against the latest value of the crypto, each coin is multiplied by the BTC price that was there at the time of the coin&apos;s last movement. Now, MVRV is just the ratio between these two Bitcoin caps (market divided by realized). Historically, this metric has indicated when the value of BTC has been undervalued, and when it has been overvalued.

Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Hits The Brakes At $7.34 After Brief Recovery At the time of writing, the crypto total market broke below the $1 trillion mark and could re-test support at $920 billion. Macro conditions seem to be pushing down risk assets, such as cryptocurrencies and equities, In a market update shared with NewsBTC, Matt Weller, Global Head of Research for FOREX.com, and City Index, the current price action across the sector has been triggered by a decrease in risk appetite from market participants. There is still much uncertainty around macro-economic factors which could be contributing to the latter. The U.S. Dollar (DXY Index) has been pushing upwards, as the market seeks shelter from high inflation and uncertainty, negatively impacting other major currencies, equities, and crypto assets. If the U.S. dollar continues its ascend, the total market cap for the nascent sector could see a 58% decline by completing a bear flag formed on its weekly chart. As analyst Caleb Franzen said, this could push the sector to its 2020 levels at around $400 billion and take down a large portion of the profits generated during the past bull run.

42411407,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNYZn,1661192644,Are NFTs Rendering Art Meaningless?,"Years after his ingratiation into Andy Warhol’s inner circle, Jean Baudrillard knifed the fine art world.  “Art does not die because there is no more art. It dies because there is too much,” wrote the French philosopher in ""The Conspiracy of Art,"" his 2005 treatise taking aim at a system of gallerists and collectors who transformed fine art into a commodity.  Agnieszka Pilat is a Polish-American artist whose work renders machines as portraitures. Her upcoming show, ROBOTa, will be held at the San Francisco gallery Modernism Inc.  Baudrillard retrofitted his theory of simulacra, which inspired the Matrix movie franchise, to the art market, showing how artists had been compromised by the totality of a monopoly system (“there is more and more information and less and less meaning,” wrote the philosopher in 1979). When the non-fungible token (NFT) frenzy took off in January of last year, many successful artists (some even revered) lost themselves to the mania of market forces, producing digital collectibles solely because everyone was cashing in on a gold rush.  Collective mania and groupthink incentivize short-term, reactionary thinking, and even the most brilliant artists succumb to these forces. Rather than making thoughtful critiques of the system which creates these periods, they too get swept up in the cultural and economic tailwinds — selling out as commodities, as Baudrillard noted.  Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?  There is no “right” way to create art, and some of the best pieces come from sporadic expression. However, when the medium is guided so heavily by the vulgar trading of commodities, as amplified by the NFT frenzy, then artists lose their voice in society.  With JPEGs of cartoon rocks selling for $1.3 million, and the technology enabling insider trading and money laundering, NTFs, unfortunately, magnified all the problems of the traditional arts market. Everyone knew the NFT frenzy was a bubble, and it’s about time it burst.  As the ecosystem consolidates, the cliché in tech circles is that the emerging crypto economy is in a “Builder’s Market.” Tech founders, as well as artists creating NFTs, are taking a step back to reassess their projects, while examining how their creations fit into network architecture. For all its shortcomings iterated in the previous market cycle, NFTs have the potential to offer incredible value to artists – from fractionalized ownership (such as Particle’s decision to tokenize a Banksy painting) to integration into live experiences. There will also likely be a continued explosion of the creation of NFTs as digital artwork, hitting platforms like OpenSea at the same velocity as the articles, blog posts, and opinion pieces which have characterized social media and the news industry.  NTFs, unfortunately, magnified all the problems of the traditional arts market.  The overproduction of NFTs runs the risk of killing art, rendering the medium meaningless as foretold by Baudrillard. As is the case with the news industry, good writing and reporting still exists (and is crucial to the democratic process), but is harder to find among the daily deluge of regurgitated commentary, incentivized by social media algorithms which encourage divisiveness.  A “Builder’s Market” is a welcome reset to the nose. With NFTs already playing such a large role in the traditional fine arts industry, they are here to stay, and will serve as the vehicle for flooding the Internet with even more digital art — Meta, DALLE and other tech companies already render complex art pieces instantly with artificial intelligence. Artists need to think carefully about how they integrate emerging technologies into their broader work, and use them to channel complex and nuanced human emotions, rather than the other way around where their dominant master is the dollar … or crypto.",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Agnieszka Pilat ,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/22/are-nfts-rendering-art-meaningless,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2cbfd285ed00e001236707ad941a04cdef0b1ab3-3438x2578.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374017,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWmyD,1661192191,Ex-OpenSea Executive Files to Dismiss DOJ Case Alleging NFT Insider Trading,"Nate Chastain, the former product head at non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea, has asked a U.S. court to dismiss insider trading charges involving the sale of NFTs on the popular platform, according to a motion filed early Monday.  Filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the motion argued that NFTs cannot be classified as securities or commodities, a requirement for wire fraud charges.  “In any prosecution under a Carpenter wire fraud theory of insider trading, the existence of securities or commodities trading remains an essential element of the offense,” wrote lawyers for Chastain, referring to Carpenter v. United States, a 2018 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court.  His attorneys also said the NFT transactions in question were processed on the Ethereum blockchain. Given the blockchain's open-source nature and public viewing availability, the lawyers argued, the transactions could not have been used for money laundering.  The Department of Justice (DOJ) in June indicted Nathaniel Chastain on charges of participating in wire fraud and money laundering involving NFTs sold on OpenSea, the internet’s largest NFT marketplace. The charges alleged Chastain defrauded OpenSea by using his knowledge of which NFTs were scheduled to be presented on the platform’s homepage to purchase the assets before they appeared, and then sell them later at a profit.  The DOJ has called Chastain’s activities the “first-ever digital asset insider trading scheme.”  Chastain resigned from OpenSea in September 2021. He has since begun working on a new NFT platform, Oval, which he has described as a “personalized platform for collecting NFTs.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/22/ex-opensea-executive-files-to-dismiss-doj-case-over-nft-sales,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4289733c4cfe69d6d1231ecca0b59d344b6d3127-3248x2436.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That’s lower than the $25 million figure that CNBC reported several months ago in a report that prompted BlockFi CEO Zac Prince to tweet, “I can 100% confirm that we aren’t being sold for $25M.”  FTX US, the sources said, would pay an additional $25 million if, by Dec. 31, BlockFi wins an important regulatory clearance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for BlockFi Yield, a product that would generate interest on depositors’ crypto by lending the crypto out at a higher rate.  FTX US would pony up another $100 million if BlockFi’s client assets reach at least $10 billion by the time Bankman-Fried’s company exercises its option to buy the company, according to the sources. BlockFi managed less than half that amount – $4.4 billion – in combined wallet assets and deployable assets at the end of the second quarter.  Lastly, FTX US agreed to pay an amount equal to 25% of BlockFi’s annual operating income, up to a maximum of $100 million, the sources said. BlockFi’s financials are private. A June 16 tweet, which purported to reveal the company’s income statement, showed it lost money in 2020 and 2021 and projected a loss for 2022.  A BlockFi spokesperson declined to comment on the legitimacy of those financials, as well as for this report. An FTX spokesperson also declined to comment.  BlockFi’s Prince has said FTX cannot exercise its purchase option before October 2023, and BlockFi has the option to buy back FTX’s option at any time for “two to three times the capital FTX put up for the deal.”  “The punchy story is, ‘BlockFi gets bailed out, Sam Bankman-Fried made the best deal of all time,’” Prince said last month on the “Animal Spirits Podcast.” “What’s harder to say is, ‘Actually, this deal can’t close until October 2023 at the earliest.’”  The terms of the deal make clear what FTX US views as BlockFi’s crown jewels: billions of dollars in retail client assets and the possibility it wins regulatory approval for the yield product. Both fit with FTX US’ strategy to court retail users – expanding beyond FTX’s roots among professional crypto traders – for its new stock-trading platform and to win regulatory approvals via acquisitions. Notably absent from the deal math are financial rewards for BlockFi’s technology, brand or intellectual property.  Before the crypto market meltdown created trouble for BlockFi, the company sought a valuation as high as $5 billion and touted blue-chip investors such as Bain Capital Ventures, Tiger Global and Paradigm as backers.  The coveted 'S-1'  The clock is ticking for BlockFi to fetch the $25 million regulatory bounty. The deal stipulates FTX US would pay that only if BlockFi gets an S-1 registration for BlockFi Yield before the end of 2022.  An S-1 is a big deal in the U.S. It’s the route companies take when they list their stock in the U.S. through an initial public offering.  In February, BlockFi was fined $100 million by the SEC for conducting an unregistered securities offering for BlockFi Yield. The product solicited crypto deposits from users and paid out interest in crypto, effectively functioning as a crypto savings bank.  According to a leaked investor call from Morgan Creek Digital, a large BlockFi backer, BlockFi consulted former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton for advice on how to handle the situation.  “Jay Clayton said, you know, settle, that’ll give you the inside track to getting a registered product in 2022,” said Morgan Creek CEO Mark Yusko during the call, which took place on June 21.  Read more: Morgan Creek Is Trying to Counter FTX’s BlockFi Bailout, Leaked Call Shows  If BlockFi were to obtain the registration, it would be the first crypto platform with a SEC-registered lending product, giving the company a huge advantage over competitors such as Celsius Network, Voyager Digital and Gemini.  It would also put FTX US ahead of its largest U.S. competitor, Coinbase (COIN). In September, Coinbase sparred with the SEC over the launch of its own Coinbase Lend product, with CEO Brian Armstrong tweeting that the SEC was “refusing to offer any opinion in writing to the industry on what should be allowed” and “engaging in intimidation tactics behind closed doors.”  Coinbase eventually scrapped the project after the SEC threatened to sue the company for offering an unregistered security.  It’s so far unclear whether the regulatory appetite for crypto lending and yield products has soured or grown more urgent after the recent collapse of crypto lenders Celsius and Voyager. But after paying the $100 million fine, BlockFi may be furthest along in the process – though if it happens after New Year’s Eve and FTX US ends up purchasing BlockFi, Bankman-Fried will get that approval for free.

42411393,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNXmC,1661186700,Is Ethereum's Merge Priced-In?,"Katie Talati, the director of research at investment firm Arca, thinks traditional finance institutions are at risk of missing out on a once-in-a-decade trade. Right now, she said, ether (ETH) is woefully underpriced and there’s a catalyst around the corner.  Next month, Ethereum will have billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies, millions of users and thousands of apps transferring to a new and improved blockchain. This follows years of R&D that will culminate in the so-called Merge, the actual technical deployment of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake chain.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “This is an event that a lot of people are undercounting, especially based on current price appreciation” of ether, said Talati, who also leads Arca’s investment research. “We're gonna look back on this in a year from now and [realize] we were at the [market] bottom there.”  Of course, this is just Talati’s opinion. But it’s an opinion widely shared widely among industry insiders. The Merge has market upside potential at a time when most headlines spell risk and not reward for crypto holders.  From Arca’s perch, Talati has observed increased retail interest in crypto in the past few weeks. Yet, “there aren't new institutions coming in,” she said. “Those will be the much more important and larger buyers of [ether].”  There are structural reasons why one might expect ETH’s price to appreciate post-Merge, Talati said.  “From a financial standpoint, the net issuance of [ether’s] supply is going to be net negative,” she said. In other words, there’s hope ETH could become a deflationary asset, making it more valuable to hold over time.  See also: Ethereum's Merge Will Increase Its Use Cases  This is the result of an Ethereum Improvement Proposal, specifically EIP-1559, instituted last year that burns ETH as part of every successful transaction and a change in Ethereum’s issuance, post-Merge.  For at least six months after Ethereum ditches proof-of-work, users who stake their assets will not be immediately able to withdraw their assets. This creates a “supply sink” that essentially caps the issuance of new ETH entering into circulation, she said.  Add the fact that there will now be an incentive for people to lock up their ETH on Ethereum, to earn a staking reward.  “You will see the circulating supply of [ether] increase with staking, but it won't actually be available for individuals to sell,” Talati said.  Some people have referred to this as Ethereum’s “thirdening,” a reference to Bitcoin’s “halvening” or the cyclical decrease in new bitcoin (BTC) issuance every four years. These programmatic cuts to supply are sometimes thought to drive up prices, (or at least drive awareness to crypto markets).  Risks  Still, there are risks to the trade. First, Ethereum’s Merge could be delayed – which would send a “negative signal” to the markets, at least in the short term, Talati said. Then there’s the prospect that something could go wildly wrong during or after deployment, a risk that’s hard to calculate given all the moving parts that could break. (Ethereum upgrades have been delayed before, and several times.)  Another risk are all the planned and possible Ethereum forks that will keep the proof-of-work algorithm. This will fracture the market, Talati said. Some prominent crypto firms have already pledged to support some PoW forks, like ETHPOW, which prominent miner and investor Chandler Guo has backed.  There’s also the possible sell pressure on ETH, once people will be able unlock their coins. Some people have locked their ETH for nearly two years, ever since the so-called Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract went live with the experimental Beacon Chain. They’ve also earned returns on their capital in the form of staking rewards that could be sold for cash or reinvested.  “It's kind of hard to predict that behavior,” Talati said, adding that many early stakers are likely long-term supporters of Ethereum who would be less inclined to sell.  See also: Ethereum's Political Philosophy Explained | Opinion  It’s worth adding that much of Ethereum’s issuance schedule could change. There is no guarantee that ETH will become deflationary, a major selling point for institutions, which depends on high levels of Ethereum use (and thus high levels of burnt ETH).  So considering the financial, technical and other unpredictable risks of the largest blockchain upgrade in history, is there a way to hedge your bets?  Investors seem to be aware of the downside risk. Put options, or contracts that allow people the option to sell an asset, for ETH are “really expensive in the current market,” Talati said.

The update was originally slated for Aug. 17, but was postponed for four days to allow some offline validators to rejoin the network.  While the effects of the upgrade aren’t of the “user-facing” variety, the upgrade itself is worth understanding from a technical point of view, as it has implications for the future success of Ethereum's main blockchain after it transitions from a proof-of-work to a proof-of stake consensus protocol.  In preparation for the Ethereum Merge forecast for mid-September, a series of test networks (testnets) have run through the merge process and transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. One of these testnets, Sepolia, successfully merged with its proof-of-stake beacon chain on July 6.  Read more: Merge Testing on Ethereum: What Is It and Why Does It Matter?  The Sepolia testnet went through an upgrade on its Execution Layer (EL), at block 1,735,371. This caused EL clients to disconnect from any peers that did not transition to proof-of-stake, a process which helps maintain a healthy network for Ethereum. The Ethereum Foundation noted that the upgrade will not add additional functionality to the chain.  Parithosh Jayanthi, a DevOps engineer at the Ethereum Foundation, told CoinDesk that “the upgrade is there just to clear up any dead nodes in the system. This is sort of a cleanup, and we wouldn’t really expect to see any change.” Jayanthi also noted that this is something they have to do every time a network merges.  The Ropsten testnet did not upgrade because that chain is considered to be deprecated. On the Aug. 18 All Core Developers call, Ethereum developers discussed deprecating the Kiln testnet as well, ahead of the Merge (a bit earlier than anticipated), given that not many transactions are taking place on it, and participants have moved most of their testing over to the Goerli tesnet. Goerli, which transitioned to proof-of-stake last week, will still see network upgrades even after the Merge on Ethereum’s mainnet.  Alex Stokes, a researcher working on the Merge with the Ethereum Foundation, told CoinDesk that the upgrade isn’t that significant but it can be used as an identifier to help with peer discovery, or finding other nodes in the network. He also said that, ultimately, developers just want the upgrade to go well. They will “do something similar on other networks, but ultimately it will have similarly low fanfare.”  Read more: Ethereum’s After the Merge: What Comes Next?",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/22/sepolia-is-the-first-ethereum-testnet-to-get-a-post-merge-upgrade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1db0659c8e759ff632ca397202e95f7ed52ac7c4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The event is one of the many “flippenings” to happen in the crypto world, with both communities having long desired to be the most valued PFP in the digital collectible space.  Floor prices are the lowest price for which an individual NFT in a collection can be purchased. High floor prices indicate growing demand.  Read more: How to Make, Buy and Sell NFTs  This flip didn't hold for long. By late morning New York time, Bored Apes had retaken the lead on trading venue OpenSea, where both collections' floors hovered in the 66-67 ETH range, around $104,000.  It’s not the first time Punks have found themselves on top, or at least close to it. The early NFT project held the title of most valuable PFP collection from 2019 until last December, when Bored Apes overtook them.  Unlike last winter, when the price of ETH was pushing $4,000 and trading volumes were at all-time highs, this flippening comes as the rival collections’ prices are on the way down. The Bored Ape floor price is down almost 40% in the last month, with CryptoPunks down 24%, according to data from NFTPriceFloor. When the Bored Ape floor price passed that of CryptoPunks last time around, the cheapest editions from both collections were valued 55 ETH, at the time worth $215,000.  Read more: Many Bored Ape NFTs Are in Danger of Getting Liquidated as Borrowed Money Comes Back to Bite  “Apes have not had their 50% drop yet from peak (in ETH) terms. Every other collection has, and will over time,” Nikolai Yakovenko, founder of the NFT valuation site DeepValueNFT, said of the flip. “Punks have, Fidenzas have, it was pretty unlikely that Apes would not have a drop like this.”  The race to the bottom may not be over. Between cascading loan liquidations and the recent declines in NFT trading volumes, both collections could continue losing value before an eventual rebound.  Yuga Labs, the creators of Bored Ape Yacht Club, purchased the CryptoPunks collection in March. The ape stewards then assembled a Punks-focused development and marketing team in an effort to revitalize the brand.  The co-founders of Yuga Labs have publicly downplayed the importance of floor prices. In a recent interview they said Yuga is more focused on bringing utility to its community than keeping prices high.",NEUTRAL,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/22/cryptopunks-briefly-flip-bored-apes-as-nft-prices-continue-to-crater,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3723f256e7583df073af60ca3af52807fed3aae7-3238x2428.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The so-called “Withhold Accounts” group is composed of customers in U.S. states where Celsius became unable to offer them serviceable custody accounts thanks to cease and desist orders from regulators. These people were given the option to move their funds to withhold accounts, where it remains frozen.  The withhold group, which accounts for just $14.5 million of the roughly $12 billion marooned on Celsius when it stopped withdrawals back in June, has hired the legal representation of Deborah Kovsky-Apap, a partner at Troutman Pepper.  “We believe that the coins held in Withhold are not property of the estate,” said Kovsky-Apap in an email. “They’re simply not part of the Celsius ecosystem – it’s more like the depositors left their wallet at the bar and the bartender is just holding onto it until they come back to get it. We believe the Withhold accounts should be unfrozen as soon as possible so that depositors can retrieve their property.”  Read more: Crypto Lender Celsius' Collapse Into Bankruptcy Should Be Probed, US Says  The bankruptcy hearing of Celsius, which froze customer accounts in June because of a giant hole in its balance sheet, is trying to appease some 1.7 million customers. Many of those were retail crypto holders attracted by the promising yields of decentralized finance (DeFi) and who saw Celsius as a safe option because the company was based on U.S. soil and promoted itself as a better option than a bank.  Celsius also must answer to its major institutional creditors and equity holders.  Withhold is not the first Celsius ad hoc group, a situation where bankruptcy claimants who believe they have a good enough argument hire their own legal counsel. Celsius custody account holders, who did not use the Earn program, have also sought their own legal representation.

These customers were told that if they wanted to remain in the Earn program they could be grandfathered in, explained Benny Wong, one of the organizers of the Withhold group.  “When it came to withdrawing out of Earn, Celsius gave a lot of warning messages that you are irreversibly withdrawing out of Earn and that you are going to lose out on earning interest until it becomes legal to exist in your state,” said Wong in an interview. “But then funds outside of Earn just got put into this third account type that we never even knew existed.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/22/celsius-depositors-fracture-again-on-legal-strategy-as-withhold-group-lawyers-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/444d082332486dde0f14efbcc67da1bcca5efa54-5000x3750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As of August 21, the price stands at $21,184.13 after losing 1.18% from its previous day&apos;s value. The news from the US Federal Reserve about its intent on following a hawkish approach to fighting inflation set the market downtrend.

Some analysts are still optimistic for the wider market, which might give the cryptocurrency some momentum. Other analysts see BTC and ETH remaining choppy in the short term.  Market Moves: Bitcoin fell over 10% last week, its biggest drop in two months. Analysts say the price slide has put bears in control ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday.  Chart of the Day: Ether-bitcoin volatility spread widens.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  It looks like macroeconomics has retaken the front seat as inflation fears caused jitters in the market on Monday. Bitcoin (BTC) dipped to levels below $21,000 at around 09:30 am GMT, with a sharp sell-off following the previous week’s surge.  U.S. equity futures retreated along with European stocks as traders are pessimistic about the prospect of further interest-rate hikes. Although most investors think sentiment is looking fragile, Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat, said in a morning note to investors that he expects markets to rally.  “While there remains a lot of uncertainty regarding macro, we think underlying inflationary pressures are easing, which in turn means [the U.S. Federal Reserve] has less work to do,” wrote Lee. “This is not necessarily the consensus view. But it is a view increasingly transmitted in the bond market.”  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, has dropped to $1,500, down 17% over the last seven days. Ether reached levels near $2,000 last week on the back of optimism ahead of the Ethereum blockchain’s upcoming Merge but has since been hit as crypto’s correlation with equities strengthened.  Short term, ether and bitcoin will trade in choppy territory with a negative bias, according to Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack Funds.  Dibb expects the crypto market to stabilize heading into September.  “Longer term, the Merge is still a bullish event, similar to the lag that BTC experiences post every halving.”  In the news, more than 50 people gathered in Amsterdam's Dam Square on Saturday to protest the arrest of blockchain developer Alexey Pertsev, who was arrested Aug. 10 on suspicion of involvement in the Tornado Cash protocol that was sanctioned earlier this month by U.S. authorities.  And Morgan Stanley said in a report on Friday that tightening in the crypto market has paused. While the market cap of stablecoins, an indicator of crypto liquidity, has stopped falling, demand for leverage has yet to start recovering.

Analysts say the price slide has put bears in control ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday.  The biggest cryptocurrency was sold as the Fed's July meeting minutes actively pushed back against hopes of liquidity easing in 2023. Chatter about Jump Crypto selling ether spurred profit taking in the native token of Ethereum's blockchain.  Bitcoin's drop has broken technical charts and revived the bearish trend, according observers.  ""Last week's slide has put the bears in the driver's seat. The market will take a while to reverse and would need good news,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk, adding that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is unlikely to offer good news later this week.  According to David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, bitcoin's daily technical chart has flipped bearish and the cryptocurrency could continue to lose ground in the short term.  ""BTC will likely retest support at $20,830 and $19,230 over the coming few weeks,"" Duong noted in the weekly markets commentary, adding that traders will be closely watching Powell's comments at the Jackson Hole symposium.  After last week's Fed minutes, there seems to be a consensus in the market that Powell will skew on the hawkish side during the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. The annual gathering, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, hosts central bankers, finance ministers, academics and financial market participants.  ""Powell will likely try to take a more measured approach in Wyoming and emphasize that the tightening cycle isn't over yet,"" Duong noted. The Fed's monetary tightening has roiled the cryptocurrency market this year.  Michael Kramer, the founder of Mott Capital Management, wrote in a weekly markets update, ""I would expect that Powell lays out quite clearly that the pace of future rate hikes may slow but that they have much further to climb and are likely to remain high for some time.""  The Fed said in July that it would be appropriate to slow tightening at some point, triggering a relief rally in risk assets. However, according to Dean Peng, VP at Singapore-based digital asset management platform Metalpha, monetary policy operates with a lag. So, the central bank will likely stick to its hawkish script at least for some time.  The effect of higher interest rates on inflation will be evident in about six months. Peng said. ""It is still too early to put in more calls for bitcoin at this time.""  Read the full story here.  Chart of the Day  Ether-Bitcoin Volatility Spread Widens  By Omkar Godbole  The spread between ether and bitcoin implied volatilities determined by options expiring on Sept. 30 has widened to over 30 percentage points, the highest since June 2021, according to data tracked by Genesis Volatility.  It means two things: First, traders expect ether to see more volatility than bitcoin in the next five weeks or so, as the Ethereum Merge, the long-pending technological update, is likely to happen sometime in mid-September. Second, ether options are now too expensive relative to bitcoin options. Implied volatility has positive impact on option prices.  The spread will tank if the merge proves to be a non-event.  ""Some traders are positioning themselves for a mean-reversion [in the spread], selling ETH against buying BTC long,"" options analytics platform Genesis Volatility said in a report last week.

(DTCC) is a quiet giant on Wall Street, processing basically every trade in the more than $40 trillion U.S. stock market.  It just officially joined the crypto-revolution, announcing Monday that it began live testing of a private blockchain to see whether it's up to the challenge of clearing and settling transactions in the world's largest equities market. The Project Ion platform now processes more than 100,000 trades per day on average, and almost 160,000 on peak days.  That's a drop in the bucket for an industry that measures daily volume in billions of shares, but it's also one of the biggest milestones yet in traditional finance's years-long march toward embracing the ledger technology underpinning bitcoin (BTC) and the rest of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Project Ion was launched as a pilot program in 2020 and moved into a development program in September.  Settling stock trades in the U.S. currently takes two days, a glacial pace compared with cryptocurrencies. That relative sluggishness stands out in an era when stock trades are often get measured in billionths-of-a-second time scales. During feverish trading of meme stocks early last year, Robinhood restricted trades in some of them because of a $3 billion collateral request from DTCC, which stockpiles money as a safeguard in case something bad happens during the two days it's processing a trade.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has proposed speeding up stock settlement times to something called T+0 – jargon for processing trades the same day they're executed. Last year, Robinhood (HOOD) CEO Vlad Tenev said that T+0 would've prevented volatile markets like those seen with meme-trader favorites GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC).  Major Wall Street players have for years been experimenting with blockchains. The former president of the New York Stock Exchange told the Wall Street Journal in a story published Monday that ""blockchain technology is going to rewire all financial services.""  DTCC said its conventional system for processing trades remains in effect; trades on its private blockchain are being handled in parallel.  The DTCC project, which is private and permissioned unlike many traditional blockchain networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, is being developed with firms including Barclays (BCS), BNY Mellon (BK), Charles Schwab (SCHW), Citadel Securities, Citigroup (C) and Credit Suisse (CS). DTCC partnered with software providerR3 to launch Project Ion using R3's Corda distributed ledger technology (DLT) software.  ""Digitized assets and emerging technology like DLT are shaping and evolving the financial services landscape, and we remain committed to advancing innovative solutions that capitalize on opportunities, deliver new value and drive the industry forward,"" said Murray Pozmanter, managing director and president of DTCC Clearing Agency Services.

These addresses were either sanctioned by the U.S. government or had directly received hacked or stolen funds from numerous crypto platforms in the past few years.  The 253 blocked crypto addresses can continue to use Uniswap’s smart contracts – a decentralized service that exists on the Ethereum blockchain. However, they cannot use the popular Uniswap website, which is a frontend managed and maintained by Uniswap Labs, a New York-based company.  ""[It] surely it makes no sense to block it,"" said Banteg, pointing out that a burn wallet was among the 253 blocked addresses. Other wallets, noted Banteg, were only connected to a bad wallet and may not have directly engaged in nefarious activities.  Thirty addresses blocked by Uniswap were associated with Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain names, a service that ties crypto wallets to human-readable names, added Banteg: ""Most are likely legitimate users that have fallen to trm collateral damage.""  Uniswap is currently working with blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs to trace a user’s wallet activity as part of a broader risk management drive, as per an April post.  The DEX previously blocked addresses on the U.S. Treasury Depart's sanctions list but has since extended the purview to include wallet addresses associated with illicit activity, such as stolen funds or ransomware, from interacting with the Uniswap frontend developed and maintained by Uniswap Labs.

The firms have applied for preliminary approval and establishment of corporations to run virtual asset exchanges, the report said.  Mirae Asset Securities and Samsung Securities are among the seven firms, the newspaper reported, citing anonymous industry sources. Mirae has established a subsidiary under its affiliate Mirae Consulting, which is hiring technical staff for various cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens, while Samsung is studying how to enter the blockchain-based security tokens market, NewsPim reported. At the end of last year, Samsung could not find staff to build a crypto trading platform, the newspaper wrote.  South Korean President Yoon Suk-Yeol took office in May and had promised to be more friendly to the crypto industry and nurture new projects. However, due to the collapse of stablecoin terraUSD (UST), authorities have become more stringent, raiding exchanges and flagging others for not registering properly.  The fact that big traditional firms are looking to enter crypto is in line with Yoon's easing of regulations, NewsPim wrote.

42394887,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWKnM,1661167451,Morgan Stanley Says Tightening in the Crypto Market Has Paused,"Institutional investors have stopped redeeming stablecoins and the coins’ market cap, an indicator of liquidity in the crypto market, has stopped falling. Even so, there appears to be little demand for positions to be rebuilt, Morgan Stanley (MS) said in a research report Friday.  Last week was the first time since April that the market cap of the coins – cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to real-world assets such as gold or national currencies – didn’t drop on a monthly basis, according to the report. While it is still 20% below its peak, this may be a sign that “extreme institutional deleveraging” appears to have paused for now.  With central banks continuing to tighten monetary policy, there isn't much demand to borrow to finance crypto investments, the bank said, noting that lending on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms is down 70% this year.  DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain without the use of traditional intermediaries.  Morgan Stanley says it will be difficult for this crypto cycle to bottom without “fiat leverage growing or crypto leverage growing.” Demand for leverage in the crypto industry remains subdued, and as ether (ETH) has rallied, margin calls on crypto borrowers have paused, the note said.  The bank notes that redemptions of the stablecoin tether (USDT) have stopped, and its market issuance has actually risen in the last week, increasing $1.7 billion in 10 days.

Analysts say the price slide has put bears in control ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday.  The biggest cryptocurrency by market cap was sold as the Fed's July meeting minutes actively pushed back against hopes of liquidity easing in 2023. Chatter about Jump Crypto selling ether (ETH) spurred profit taking in the native token of Ethereum's blockchain.  Bitcoin's drop has broken technical charts and revived the bearish trend, according observers.  ""Last week's slide has put the bears in the driver's seat. The market will take a while to reverse and would need good news,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk, adding that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is unlikely to offer good news later this week.  According to David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, bitcoin's daily technical chart has flipped bearish and the cryptocurrency could continue to lose ground in the short term.  Read more: US Federal Reserve Minutes Show More Rate Hikes Coming, Concern About Stablecoin Risks  ""BTC will likely retest support at $20,830 and $19,230 over the coming few weeks,"" Duong noted in the weekly markets commentary, adding that traders will be closely watching Powell's comments at the Jackson Hole symposium.  After last week's Fed minutes, there seems to be a consensus in the market that Powell will skew on the hawkish side during the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. The annual gathering, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, hosts central bankers, finance ministers, academics and financial market participants.  ""Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely try to take a more measured approach in Wyoming and emphasize that the tightening cycle isn't over yet,"" Duong noted. The Fed's monetary tightening has roiled the cryptocurrency market this year.  Michael Kramer, the founder of Mott Capital Management, wrote in a weekly markets update, ""I would expect that Powell lays out quite clearly that the pace of future rate hikes may slow but that they have much further to climb and are likely to remain high for some time.""  The Fed said in July that it would be appropriate to slow tightening at some point, triggering a relief rally in risk assets. However, according to Dean Peng, VP at Singapore-based digital asset management platform Metalpha, monetary policy operates with a lag. So, the central bank will likely stick to its hawkish script at least for some time.  The effect of higher interest rates on inflation will be evident in about six months. Peng said. ""It is still too early to put in more calls for bitcoin at this time.""  The Fed has plenty of room to maintain the pro-tightening bias for some time, as conditions in the nearly of the U.S. financial markets have loosened since mid-June.  Tighter economic conditions are widely seen as a sign of growth slowdown and vice versa. The tighter the conditions, the more challenging it is for the central bank to drain liquidity from the economy without restricting growth.  While bitcoin's short-term prospects look bleak, most of the downtrend has likely played out. ""Medium to long-term perspective, the current market is at the bottom of the Kitchin cycle, and the bottom-building process will recur over the next few months,"" Metalpha's Peng said.

The March exploit affected Ronin validator nodes for Sky Mavis, the publisher of the popular Axie Infinity game, and the Axie DAO, with attackers stealing some 173,600 ether and 25.5 million in USDC.  The attacker “used hacked private keys in order to forge fake withdrawals” from the Ronin bridge across two transactions, according to a blog posted at the time, as previously reported.  SlowMist’s “blitezero” said in a tweet that some 6,249 ether converted by the attacker through Tornado Cash was sent to crypto exchange Huobi, where it was exchanged for bitcoin, and 5,028 ether was sent to FTX on March 28.

42394877,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWKeV,1661160083,Australia to Use 'Token Mapping' as Framework for Crypto Regulation,"Australia's new government, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese since May 23, will begin a review of how cryptocurrency assets are managed, with a view toward keeping practices up to date and protecting consumers, Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers said in a statement released on Monday.  ""Australians are experiencing a digital revolution across all sectors of the economy, but regulation is struggling to keep pace and adapt with the crypto asset sector,"" Chalmers said in the statement.  ""As the first step in a reform agenda, Treasury will prioritize ‘token mapping’ work in 2022, which will help identify how crypto assets and related services should be regulated. This hasn’t been done anywhere else in the world, so it will make Australia leaders in this work.""  Token mapping involves uncovering the characteristics of all digital asset tokens in Australia including charting the type of crypto asset, its underlying code, and any other defining technological feature, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.  “As it stands, the crypto sector is largely unregulated, and we need to do some work to get the balance right so we can embrace new and innovative technologies while safeguarding consumers,” Chalmers said.  “With the increasingly widespread proliferation of crypto assets – to the extent that crypto advertisements can be seen plastered all over big sporting events – we need to make sure customers engaging with crypto are adequately informed and protected,” the statement said.  Chalmers said that before ""token mapping"" is completed, the government will release a consultation paper with the sector about a regulatory framework.  “The great Web3 companies of tomorrow need the flexibility to be able to innovate today,” Holger Arians, CEO of Banxa, an Australia-based fiat to crypto exchange, told CoinDesk in a text message, reflecting concerns that since the space is evolving quickly, regulation will need to adjust.  “While we believe the token mapping exercise is a step in the right direction, we hope to see ongoing close collaboration with our industry so that the appropriate regulatory frameworks can be put in place,” he wrote.  The move appears to have become a political issue since it comes three months after Albanese’s government defeated the previous labor administration under Scott Morrison. Chalmer said the ""previous government dabbled in crypto asset regulation but prematurely jumped straight to options without first understanding what was being regulated.""  ""The Albanese government is taking a more serious approach to work out what is in the ecosystem and what risks need to be looked at first,” Chalmers said.  Chalmers specified that ""the aim will be to identify notable gaps in the regulatory framework, progress work on a licensing framework, review innovative organisational structures, look at custody obligations for third-party custodians of crypto assets and provide additional consumer safeguards,"" according to the statement.

With a market cap of $1.18 billion, the intraday trading volume of AAVE has increased by 6.47% to reach $147 million. Past Performance of AAVE The AAVE price action shows a bearish reversal from the supply zone at $115, resulting in a bearish break out of the long-coming rising channel pattern.

Bitcoin Recovers Slightly; Ether Also Rises  By James Rubin  Cryptos exhaled over the weekend after Friday's steep price plunge as investors continued to chew over the latest inflation data and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.  Bitcoin was recently trading at about $21,500, up more than 1% over the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization plunged by more than 9% at one point Friday following an unexpectedly disappointing inflation report from Germany, Europe's largest economy by gross domestic product, and renewed concerns about the pace of interest rate hikes in the U.S. Declines in the U.S. housing market also left already anxious investors further on-edge.  ""Bitcoin's failure to breach $25,000 has capped its rally and it appears that macroeconomic concerns continue to affect markets,"" Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  But DiPasquale added optimistically ""that healthy consolidation leading into September will be a positive sign for the bulls, especially if bitcoin does not create a new low below $18,000.""  Markets will be nervously eyeing remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is scheduled to speak Friday at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's Economic Policy Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Powell may foreshadow the Federal Reserve's monetary direction at September's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard has already said he is leaning toward voting for a third, consecutive 75 basis point rate hike instead of a less hawkish 50 basis points.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market value, was recently trading slightly above $1,600, a more than 2% gain over the previous 24 hours, although far removed from the $2,000 threshold it held a week ago. Investors' enthusiasm for next month's scheduled Merge, the Ethereum blockchain's shift in protocol from proof-of-work to faster, more energy efficient proof-of-stake, has cooled – at least temporarily. Other major altcoins spent Sunday well in the green with RVN and BNB recently up over 9% and 6%, respectively. SHIB's recent roller coaster ride continued with the popular meme coin rising nearly 5% at one point.  Equities  Cryptos mostly on, but sometimes off correlation with stocks was on Friday as major indexes tumbled with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropping 2% and 1.2%, respectively. Stocks had risen four straight weeks before succumbing to investors' fresh unease about inflation's staying power and monetary policy next steps. Powell may try to spin the inflation narrative positively, as CoinDesk's Helene Braun wrote.  Crypto news  In a weekend op-ed to The Wall Street Journal, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler renewed his call for crypto firms to ""comply with securities law."" Gensler highlighted crypto lending platforms' freezing of accounts and recent bankruptcies that have left investors beholden to legal proceedings. ""There’s no reason to treat the crypto market differently from the rest of the capital markets just because it uses a different technology,"" he wrote.  On Monday, the Australian government announces plans to ""token map"" the country's digital asset sector as an initial step in crafting new regulation for cryptos, according to multiple reports. Australia would become the first country to catalog the number, type and underlying code of available cryptos as part of a wider effort to protect investors. More than one million people in the country have interacted with cryptos since 2018, according to the Australian tax office.  BitBull's DiPasquale suggested that bitcoin could fall further, depending on ""hints from the Fed"" on interest rates. Merge sentiment could also affect investors' attitudes.  In case BTC does fall below the previous low, we could be looking at further downside, potentially toward the $15,000 range,"" he wrote. ""However, as long as Bitcoin stays between $18,000 - $20,000, bulls should gain confidence.""

Insights  Indian Crypto's Challenging Year  By James Rubin  Observers of India's burgeoning crypto industry expected steep new taxes on digital assets to complicate the lives of investors and entrepreneurs.  That reality has taken shape, although higher taxes have hardly been the only cause. The industry now faces the same combination of increased regulatory scrutiny, falling prices and special circumstances that have plagued digital assets worldwide. How this scenario evolves in the world's fifth-largest economy by gross domestic product (GDP) may offer guidance for other countries facing similar fine balancing acts in protecting consumers while nurturing crypto innovation.  For now, the landscape has shifted in favor of a more restrictive environment. Earlier this month, India's Enforcement Directorate (ED), a government agency that is responsible for probing financial crimes, froze assets worth 3.7 billion rupees ($46.4 million) at crypto exchange Vauld. The ED said it is interested in wallets held by Flipvolt – Vauld's legal entity in India – which contain ""proceeds of crime derived from predatory lending practices"" that it said were subsequently transferred abroad. The ED accused the company of aiding that process via lax checks.  In July, the crypto lender, which is backed by billionaire Peter Thiel, filed for bankruptcy protection from its Singaporean creditors. The filing came after Vauld suspended withdrawals on its platform, following a market downturn that led to significant withdrawals.  WazirX troubles  Vauld's latest difficulties roughly coincide with the ED's raid of properties related to Sameer Mhatre, a director of WazirX, a Mumbai-based, trading platform that authorities said had ""actively assisted 16 fintech companies in laundering the proceeds of crime using the crypto route."" The government has frozen $8.1 million in funds held by WazirX. The ED has been investigating several fintech companies over alleged fraud on instant loan apps, which are apps that make short-term loans. Separately, WazirX is itself the subject of investigation by India's Ministry of Finance under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), as CoinDesk also reported.  And the Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC), the only advocacy body representing the interests of India's crypto industry, was disbanded by its parent organization, the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI).  Crypto tax  In late March, Parliament passed a controversial proposal that imposed a 30% capital gains tax on crypto transactions and 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) and on crypto gifts without allowing for deductions on losses. The taxes went into effect on April 1 and July 1, respectively.  In a March interview with CoinDesk that focused on the new tax, WazirX CEO Nischal Shetty said defiantly that ""there will be periods of pain.""  He added presciently: ""Crypto is a technology that will survive no matter what. It's just about ""how fast do we want as a nation to grow in this sector?""
