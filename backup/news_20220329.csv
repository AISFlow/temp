As NewsBTC has been reporting, smaller caps have been looking like the best investment in the past months. Now that the larger Caps found relief recording gains once more during March, the Smaller Cap is still crushing the numbers. Small Caps Outperforming According to data from the latest Weekly Report from Arcane Research, the whole crypto market has seen relief during March. However, even with recent gains, the Small Cap Index still has completely outperformed the other indexes. As seen in the chart below, Bitcoin, the Large Cap, and Mid Cap indexes have all seen relevant gains during March in the 8-11% increase range. But compared to the Small Cap Index, the larger indexes are lagging behind its massive 40% gains. The massive gains have a few lead characters.

Waves is a global open-source platform for decentralized applications.

42423622,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2cK7h,1648594939,State Regulators Crack Down on Voyager Digital's Crypto Interest Offering,"Securities regulators in at least seven U.S. states are scrutinizing Voyager Digital (VYGVF) , the Canadian crypto investments firm, over its offering of interest-bearing crypto accounts, Director of the Alabama Securities Commission Joseph Borg told CoinDesk on Tuesday.  The states – New Jersey, Alabama, Oklahoma, Texas, Kentucky, Vermont and Washington – believe Voyager Digital's ""Earn Program"" accounts may be unregistered securities, he said. They coordinated to file separate legal actions (including at least one ""cease and desist"") against the publicly traded firm.  ""The thrust is to say, 'OK guys, it's time to come to the table,"" Borg said in a phone call.  The effort continues a yearlong battle by U.S. states to bring crypto interest accounts under their regulatory domain. BlockFi was the first company to fall under their microscope in July. It ultimately settled with state and federal regulators after paying a $100 million fine and promising to register its product as a security.  Read more: BlockFi Will Pay $100M in Settlement With SEC, State Regulators Over High-Yield Accounts: Report  ""There are some minor differences in the order but the principles are the same,"" Borg said of Voyager Digital and BlockFi.  He expressed surprise that Voyager Digital and others hadn't gotten the message of compliance the BlockFi precedent set.  Voyager responds  The investment firm said in a statement on Wednesday that it is ""aware of or has received cease and desist orders from the state securities divisions of Indiana, Kentucky, New Jersey and Oklahoma, and orders to show cause or similar orders from the state securities divisions of Alabama, Texas, Vermont and Washington.""  Voyager said it is in talks with the regulators to better understand the orders and clarify the statements it believes are inaccurate. When effective, the orders will stop the firm from offering new accounts or accepting new assets for its Earn program.  The company expects to receive a transition period before the orders come into effect.  ""Voyager is firmly convinced that its Earn Program and the Voyager Earn Accounts are not securities and intends to demonstrate its position and defend it as necessary and appropriate. Of course, Voyager supports appropriate regulation and will do its best to demonstrate to these regulators that Voyager has complied with the law,"" the company said.  Voyager by the numbers  Voyager Digital has over $5 billion and 1.5 million clients wrapped up in its interest program, according to the New Jersey cease and desist order. The Garden State ordered Voyager Digital to stop opening new interest accounts but is allowing interest payments for existing accounts.  Alabama's order is slightly different, taking the form of a ""show cause"" filing that gives Voyager a window to defend itself against before the cease and desist order comes online. The states that moved Tuesday did a mix of show cause and cease and desist orders, Borg said.  Borg suggested that crypto interest accounts should be subject to the same regulatory scrutiny applied to other interest-bearing investment products. Without oversight, he said customers could have no guarantees their money was safe, secure, or even accessible.  ""We want these folks to be in compliance,"" he said.  Voyager Digital CEO Steve Ehrlich did not pick up the phone.  UPDATE (March 30, 0:29 UTC): Adds information from Joseph Borg.

Here’s what’s happening:  Insights: Revenue at BC Technology Group's OSL crypto assets platform, which accounts for most of its business, rose significantly but the company's share price has lagged bitcoin and other assets.  Technician's take: BTC appears to be overbought, although pullbacks cold be brief.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $47,225 -1%  Ether (ETH): $3,365 -0.6%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Solana SOL +0.2% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Filecoin FIL −4.9% Computing XRP XRP −4.7% Currency Dogecoin DOGE −3.7% Currency  Bitcoin and ether are flat; other major cryptos drop  After a week of gains, some rain fell on crypto prices, even as a few rays of good news beamed in from Ukraine.  Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was recently holding steady at about $47,250, slightly down over the last 24 hours. Ether was also treading water at about the same $3,350 mark it held a day earlier. Other major cryptos were largely in the red with popular meme coins DOGE and SHIB registering two of the biggest declines during certain points of the U.S. trading day at more than 6% each, respectively. Late in the day, Axie Infinity's AXS token had fallen 9%, while Cardano's ADA was off over 3.5%.  The declines came after seven consecutive days of mainly increases among major cryptos, which market analysts have struggled to explain although many have highlighted rising interest among institutional investors, including announcements by financial services powerhouses Goldman Sachs (GS) and BlackRock (BLK). The purchase over the past six days of $1.3 billion in bitcoin by the Singapore non-profit Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) as a reserve asset for UST, which is Terra's decentralized dollar-pegged stablecoin, and commitment to buy at least $1.7 billion more in BTC, further buoyed markets earlier this week. Terra's LUNA token reached an all-time high of over $109 on Tuesday.  Crypto's performance veered from stocks, which took a small swing upwards on Tuesday amid faintly brightening hopes of a ceasefire in Ukraine. A senior Russian defense minister said Russia would ratchet back its attacks on Ukraine's capital city Kyiv, which has been a primary target of the unprovoked invasion. Also, Russia's lead negotiator, in talks with Ukraine diplomats, said that Russia would be willing to have a meeting between the presidents of the two countries. Oil prices fell 2% at one point during the day, although they were recently up slightly.  Jeff Dorman, the COO of asset manager Arca, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" that investors may have felt encouraged by an increased sense of certainty in economic and wider events. ""Markets hate uncertainty,"" said Dorman, who noted a possible de-escalation in Ukraine and clearer direction by the U.S. Federal Reserve in taming inflation through interest rate hikes this year. Dorman also mentioned the poor performance of the bond market.  ""The bond market is uninvestable right now, half of Europe and Asia is not investable,"" Dorman said. ""So where's money gonna go? It's not going to sit in cash forever. It's going to go into safer places, which is U.S. equities and real estate and also, perhaps ironically for some, digital assets.""  He added: ""So when you start to see inflows, you start to remove those negative overhangs, you look at the places that are heavy, positive catalysts or somewhat recession-proof. I would argue for Bitcoin specifically we've seen a massive, positive catalyst in the last eight weeks.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,631 +1.2%  DJIA: 35,294 +0.9%  Nasdaq: 14,619 +1.8%  Gold: $1,919 -0.2%  A good year for Hong Kong's BC Technology Group, but where are the investors?  BC Technology Group is doing a lot right to meet strong, ongoing demand among investors for cryptocurrencies, but its stock price still hasn’t reflected the gains of its digital assets platform OSL, which accounts for most of the company’s revenue.  Whether BC Technology Group trades higher in the weeks and months ahead remains uncertain despite its apparent resiliency to increasing Chinese oversight of the administrative district.  In its annual earnings, released Tuesday, BC Technology said that OSL revenue increased by 63% to $35 million year-over-year, while platform volume increased 73% to around $40 billion annually, according to the BC Technology Group announcement. Overall, the company reported a 44% increase in revenue which it largely credits to bumps in trading income from OSL.  Digital assets now account for 75% of all of BC Technology Group’s revenues, meaning that it's not as weighed down by its exposure to macro issues in China’s equities market as it was before.  As an incidental note, the company said it would be changing the currency used in its financial statements to the Hong Kong dollar (HKD), not China's yuan (RMB). China is hostile to crypto so using HKD as a denomination for reporting makes more sense.  To be sure, BC technology still isn’t profitable. But the company attributed a net loss on the need to use the capital for global expansion.  Its mid-year earnings in August, showed equally impressive gains in revenue and volume. But is this enough to satisfy the market?  Investors have been cool on the stock, which has significantly underperformed bitcoin during the last six months.  While Coinbase (COIN) stock has also underperformed bitcoin – Singapore’s QCP has noted that investors are no longer prescribing much of a premium to licenses – the gap between BC Technology Group and bitcoin is much wider, with the company underperforming both the digital asset and the Hang Seng Index itself.  Granted, the company isn’t profitable, but tech investors are usually fine overlooking lack of profitability in the early years of a company with growth potential and won’t punish a stock for it.  Part of investors’ reluctance may have to do with the grand debate on whether Hong Kong or Singapore is the right home for digital assets in Asia. FTX called Hong Kong quits last fall, with its CEO calling the regulatory environment uncertain and quarantine measures stifling to business.  Stakeholders have complained about Hong Kong’s approach to the asset class with contradictory rules and advice on crypto from the city’s different regulators, praising Singapore’s whole-of-government approach that’s centered around the Monetary Authority of Singapore its hybrid central bank and regulator.  A sign of Singapore’s institutional endorsement of crypto can also be found in partially state-owned DBS’s digital asset trading desk – which OSL’s technology powers.  But those praises can turn into laments when Singapore does things like put crypto funds on Investor Alert Lists without explanation. Singapore’s Digital Payment Token license can also be exceedingly hard to attain.  Investors hate uncertainty.  BC Technology Group’s decision to take the regulatory approach that authorities in Hong Kong prefer for crypto was wise. OSL currently has the only SFC-licensed digital asset trading platform in Hong Kong.  But whether the market agrees with its overall strategy is still unclear. Its stock has a long way to climb.  Technician's take  Bitcoin approaching resistance at $48K-$51K, support at $45K  Bitcoin (BTC) is testing resistance at the 200-day moving average, which could trigger a brief pullback.  Upside momentum is starting to fade on intraday charts, which could keep buyers on the sidelines into the Asia trading day. Still, lower support at around $45,000 could stabilize pullbacks.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is overbought for the first time in five months, which means sellers could return at the $48,000-$51,000 resistance zone – a 50% reversal of the prior downtrend.  Further, BTC is two days away from registering a countertrend sell signal, according the DeMark indicators, similar to what occurred last August. At that stage, short-term buyers will likely defend support, especially because momentum signals turned positive on the weekly chart.

42411819,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgDFQ,1648588863,"Understanding Ripple, XRP and the SEC Suit","Ripple and XRP are back in the news after a three-year court battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over whether the XRP token is a security. Complicatedly, the judge overseeing the case in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled that XRP is a security when Ripple sold it to institutional clients but isn’t a security when XRP is sold to the general public through crypto exchanges.  Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, declared the decision “A huge win” on Twitter. Others characterized the ruling as a partial win, albeit a significant one.  To understand what this ruling means and how we got here, we’ll have to step back a bit and break down the history of Ripple, the cryptocurrency XRP and the years-long path to the federal ruling.  Ripple’s History  The technological concepts behind Ripple reportedly predate Bitcoin by four to five years. In 2004-2005, Ryan Fugger, a Canadian computer programmer, developed RipplePay as a way to provide secure payment options to members of an online community via a global network.  But it would take another six years before the blockchain-based payment system known as XRP and its founding fintech company, now known as Ripple, were started.  The XRP Ledger is an open-source, public blockchain that was first created in 2011 by developers Arthur Britto, Jed McCaleb and David Schwartz to solve the inefficiencies of cross-border remittance and payments in traditional banking. (The three, along with the addition of Chris Larsen as CEO, would later found the company now known as Ripple.) The XRP Ledger serves as the rails on which the decentralized XRP cryptocurrency runs.  Distinct from the XRP asset, the Ripple transaction protocol, known as RTXP, was officially launched in 2012, and that was followed shortly by a rebranding of the company (originally known as OpenCoin) to Ripple Labs in 2013. That company changed its name again to Ripple in 2015https://ripple.com/insights/a-new-chapter-for-ripple/.  Although Ripple and XRP are inherently related, they are still separate entities – at least, on paper. Ripple is a centralized fintech company that builds global payment products and that developed the XRP payment system, which the firm describes as decentralized. XRP is an independent digital asset used for things like online payments and currency swaps, and as of July 2023, it had a market cap of about $37 billion – making it the fourth-largest cryptocurrency.  Still, Ripple uses XRP and XRP's public blockchain to power its products.  What is Ripple, exactly?  Unlike the public nature of Bitcoin and Ethereum that seek to disrupt legacy finance, Ripple focuses on improving the existing and fragmented traditional banking system.  It does that by unifying a network of independent banks and payment providers with a standardized protocol to communicate and send low-cost, immediate payments worldwide.  Co-founded by McCaleb, who later became the chief technology officer of Stellar, a rival project with similar aims, and Chris Larsen, the company initially introduced three main products for money transfers between banks.  Those products included xRapid, a liquidity product; xVia, a payment application programming interface; and xCurrent, a real-time settlement system. In 2019, xCurrent and xVia were combined and rebranded to RippleNet. xRapid was also renamed ""On-Demand Liquidity"" (ODL), which is a product used to speed up the transfer and exchange of fiat currencies between countries.  How does Ripple work?  There are two main components that comprise Ripple:  Ripple: In its entirety, Ripple provides a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS), currency exchange and remittance network. The platform, which is supported by its blockchain payment protocol, uses RippleNet to facilitate instantaneous transactions between financial entities.  RippleNet: RippleNet is the distinct network of payment facilitators and global banks that helps streamline communication and allows participants to send and receive payments seamlessly through Ripple’s distributed platform.  Like the standardized HTTPS, which is used as a common protocol for information transfer across the internet, RippleNet provides a framework and a set of rules called the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) for all network participants to follow, thereby reducing bottlenecks in transactions.  Applications can connect to the XRP Ledger through HTTP or WebSocket APIs. They can also use a library in various programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, Python, and more.  While anyone can connect to the ledger, only a few trusted validators approve transactions, and those are mostly well-known banks and financial institutions. In March 2022, the network could process up to 1,500 transactions per second with a fee of $0.0007. That is faster than Ethereum, which completes around 10 transactions per second, and Bitcoin, the original and largest blockchain, which can handle four to five transactions per second. One reason the XRP is so much faster is because it relies on a smaller network of operators, reducing the latency that comes with greater decentralization.  Gateways  Gateways provide an entry point for external people or entities who want to join the Ripple network. The gateway acts as a trusted intermediary – usually in the form of banks – to help two parties complete a transaction. They provide a channel to transfer funds in fiat and cryptocurrencies using the Ripple network.  How does XRP work?  XRP is the native cryptocurrency of the XRP Ledger, a public blockchain that relies on something called the “federated consensus” algorithm to secure and confirm transactions. It differs from the proof-of-work mechanism used by Bitcoin, and from Ethereum’s proof-of-stake.A key difference is that, unlike the bigger public blockchains, participants in the Ripple network are known and trusted by each other, based mainly on reputation. As of July 2023, there were more than 150 validators on the network and over 35 on the default unique node list (dUNL) – a list of nodes that a network participant trusts.  Three entities – Ripple, the XRP Ledger Foundation and Coil (a Ripple-funded entity) – publish lists of recommended validators based on aspects like past performance, verified identity and secure IT policies. As more validators join the network, participants have more flexibility to choose who they add to their UNL, although that provides a level of risk because not all validators carry the same level of trust and performance.  In contrast to conventional methods of overseas payments (a process that can take one to four business days), XRP can be used to provide on-demand liquidity or act as a bridging currency to settle cross-border transactions in less than five seconds and at a fraction of the cost of traditional money transfers.  To cover the cost of transaction fees, a small amount of XRP – about 10 drops, which are units of XRP worth 0.00001 XRP each – is destroyed. While the cost of sending XRP varies depending on network activity, all related transactions are executed and settled on the XRP Ledger.  Read more: What Does It Mean to Burn Crypto?  Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP can't be mined, and no new tokens will ever be created. That is because the founders issued the entire supply of 100 billion XRP tokens upon the ledger’s launch in 2012. To help the business scale, the founders allocated 80 billion tokens to Ripple and pocketed the remaining amount.  Additional XRP can still be circulated on secondary markets whenever Ripple decides to sell coins from its pre-mined supply. For example, in 2017, the company transferred 55 billion of its 80 billion XRP tokens into an escrow account from which it could sell a maximum of 1 billion tokens per month. That was organized to help improve the transparency and predictability of XRP sales.  XRP tokens held in escrow are deemed “undistributed,” with the rest accounting for the circulating supply. Any unsold tokens are returned to the escrow and re-distributed at a later date.  In March 2022, the escrow account held 46.1 billion XRP tokens. Data regarding the total XRP held and distributed by Ripple can be found on its website.  How can you buy or sell XRP?  Until the ruling in July 2023, U.S. exchanges had either delisted or temporarily halted the ability to trade XRP while the SEC suit was ongoing. Shortly after the ruling, Coinbase, Kraken and others listed XRP or announced plans to re-list for trading, though there are some restrictions still in place. For instance, New York residents were unable to buy XRP on Coinbase as of writing.  Residents outside the U.S. were able to trade XRP on exchanges like Binance, eToro and Kraken, which continues unaffected.  Pros and cons of XRP  Although it uses the open nature of blockchain to decentralize its bookkeeping and keep transactions transparent, XRP is more centralized than Bitcoin or Ethereum in that no public entity or person outside of Ripple can determine the issuance of new coins.  That is largely because XRP is ostensibly more a tool for transferring value across borders via Ripple products than it is a speculative investment vehicle – although to the SEC’s mind, it had unquestionably functioned as an investment, which led the regulator to charge Ripple in 2020 with illegally raising $1.38 billion from investors in what the SEC regarded as an “unregistered securities offering.” We’ll get more into the suit below.  Here are some advantages of Ripple and XRP:  Fast, efficient, and transparent payments with an added liquidity tool to help streamline the settlement process.  XRP settlement speed is faster than Bitcoin's or Ethereum's.  Ever-improving scalability – the XRP network can handle up to 1,500 transactions per second.  The cross-border currency payment system has attracted more than 100 financial institutions including banks to its network.  Here are some of the drawbacks:  RippleNet is not wholly decentralized compared with other public blockchains.  Because its products are tailored for big financial institutions, there is little practical relevance for retail users, although that hasn’t stopped its rabid fans, known as the XRP Army, from pumping the coin on Twitter.  Because a large majority of XRP is held by Ripple, the token's price could be easily manipulated or negatively influenced by saturating the market with large sales.  Understanding the Ripple vs. SEC Case  The battle between Ripple and the SEC is one that’s been watched closely by the crypto and financial industries as it has been seen as a bellwether for other regulation and ongoing cases with the SEC.  As noted earlier, the SEC filed its case in 2020 against Ripple alleging that the XRP token was an unregistered security that the company sold in violation of U.S. law. The case put forth that the sale of $728.9 million of XRP in direct institutional sales set the expectation that those investors would profit from Ripple’s work, which is a tenet of the Howie Test.  Ripple used those funds to ""promote and increase the value of XRP by developing uses for XRP and protecting the XRP trading market,"" according to the court order.  The second half of the ruling however, went in Ripple’s favor as the court found that “programmatic sales” of XRP through exchanges or algorithms did not set the same expectations, as there was no definitive proof that retail investors expected to profit from the efforts of others.  The ruling has been called a ‘landmark’ judgment by broker Bernstein in a research report released following the decision, writing that it shifts the “regulatory cloud over the crypto industry.” JMP Securities similarly lauded the decision as a “milestone win” but also noted that it isn’t the end of the crypto’s regulatory fight. The SEC can appeal the ruling and will likely pursue similar cases in the future.

Returns were mixed across cryptocurrencies, although some alternative cryptos (altcoins) such as WAVES, RUNE and AAVE rose by as much as 20% over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, popular meme tokens such as DOGE and SHIB declined by as much as 6% on Tuesday.  Sign up for Market Wrap, our daily newsletter explaining what happened today in crypto markets – and why. Coming April 4.  Stocks traded higher on Tuesday after Russian and Ukrainian officials said they made progress in cease-fire talks. Traditional safe havens such as gold and the U.S. dollar declined during the New York trading day, while the Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), a popular measure of the stock market's expectation of volatility based on S&P 500 index options, reached the lowest level in a month.  Fading volatility indicates less fear among market participants, which could support the current relief rally across speculative assets.  Still, some analysts are monitoring signs of a short-term pullback, especially in cryptocurrencies.  ""Bitcoin is going along with the rise of stock indices and often even acts as a leading indicator of investor sentiment,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, a trader at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. That means a temporary pullback in bitcoin could precede a drop in equity prices.

Bitcoin miners realize gains  The chart below shows the Bitcoin Miners' Position Index (MPI), which measures total miner outflows relative to its one-year moving average. The index spiked on Tuesday, which could mean that miners are selling more coins than usual.  Further, while miner outflows surged, miner flows to exchanges have been relatively stable. That suggests miners are choosing to sell BTC over the counter, directly between two parties, without the supervision of an exchange, according to CryptoQuant.  Typically, large MPI spikes occur around BTC price peaks as miners sell to realized revenue gains.  The latest price jump coupled with an all-time high in Bitcoin's hashrate, or the total combined computational power that is being used to mine and process transactions on the blockchain, has been a boon for miners.  For example, Canadian crypto miner Bitfarms (BITF) reported revenue of $60 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, up 33% from $45 million in the third quarter and up 426% from the fourth quarter of 2020.  While miners' revenue gains have been plentiful, a pullback in BTC's price could weigh on future returns.  For example, Bitcoin's hashrate growth has slowed in recent weeks despite BTC's recent breakout above $46,000, according to data compiled by CoinMetrics. Ethereum’s hashrate has also moved higher this year, although growth has slowed recently.  Altcoin roundup  Terra’s LUNA Set New Highs of $107: Terra’s LUNA tokens rose 10% in the past 24 hours to set new all-time highs of over $107.89. Sentiment for LUNA has grown in the past month largely due to the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), a Singapore-based nonprofit that is purchasing over $3 billion worth of bitcoin (BTC) as an additional layer of security for UST, Terra's decentralized dollar-pegged stablecoin, according to CoinDesk’s Shaurya Malwa.

42423618,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2cK1h,1648585355,"Bitcoin Miner Core Scientific’s Full-Year Sales Rise to $545M, Beating Estimates","The largest publicly traded bitcoin (BTC) miner by hashrate, Core Scientific (CORZ), said its fiscal 2021 revenue rose 803% to $544.5 million, beating analyst estimates of $507.1 million, according to FactSet.  The miner’s fiscal year adjusted earnings per share (diluted) came in at 32 cents, which may not compare to consensus analyst estimate of 44 cents a share, according to FactSet. The company went public in January through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Power & Digital Infrastructure Acquisition.  It also reported fourth quarter sales, in a presentation, of $301.8 million, beating analyst estimates of $205.7 million, according to FactSet.  “Across our business we are executing our plans effectively and remain well positioned to continue expanding our capacity and creating shareholder value,” said CEO Mike Levitt in a statement.  The miner stuck to its 2022 hashrate guidance to 40 EH/s and 42 EH/s. On March 7, Core said it sees hashrate reaching 40 EH/s-42 EH/s by the end of this year, which will be distributed approximately evenly between its self-mining and hosting segments.  Regarding the 2022 hashrate guidance, the company said on its earnings call that its growth won't be “perfectly linear” due to global supply-chain issues, but believes that it can achieve the year-end objectives.  “We think that approximately 30% of our 2022 infrastructure development will be completed by the end of the second quarter,” Levitt said on the call, noting that the rest will be during the back end of the year.  Levitt also said that to raise funding for its growth, the company intends to explore both the traditional debt markets and some of the sort of “newer technology, bitcoin-related financing alternatives,” as well as asset-backed lending options.  Furthermore, Levitt expects M&A within the mining industry to ramp up in the next 12 months as some companies become capital-constrained. “If I were a betting man, I'd probably say that I think that there going to be opportunities, because I think the capital flows are going to be more discriminating over the course of the next year,” he said.  Levitt’s comments come as miners are having to look beyond stock issuance to fund their growth. They may have to borrow against their machines or mined crypto, or even put themselves up for sale.  Shares rose almost 3% to $8.95 in post-market trading on Tuesday as bitcoin prices rose 1.2%. Core Scientific shares are down about 19% this year.

Data Shows Bitcoin RHODL Ratio Has Observed Decline Recently As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the supply of coins older than one year has significantly risen recently. To understand the RHODL ratio, you first need to have a look at the &apos;realized cap HODL waves.&apos; This indicator measures the USD-dominated amount of Bitcoin held by investors hodling since different periods of time. For example, the wave band for coin age more than 1+ year shows the total amount of coins all investors hodling since at least a year currently own. The &apos;realized HODL&apos; (or RHODL in short) ratio is a metric that tells us the ratio between the wave bands of 1-week old and 1-year old Bitcoin supplies.

Since then, DeFi has been growing at an accelerating rate, with new projects launching every month. But, starting a DeFi project requires a lot of research and development expertise. The founders need to research the DeFi space and how to launch successful projects. However, after serious research, founders should still be very careful when considering creating a crypto startup. But why should crypto startups be cautious of DeFi? Here are the five reasons. Blockchain Risks DeFi largely depends on how the host blockchain infrastructure operates. If the host blockchain has some problems, all the DeFi projects will face a similar problem. For instance, DeFi projects suffered from Ethereum&apos;s low scale and high gas fees. Moreover, there are other compromising factors in blockchains. Blockchains using proof of stake mechanism could fall into the issue of validator cartels. A validator cartel is when multiple network validators conspire to control reward distributions in a blockchain. They end up affecting all DeFi protocols operating under the blockchain. Hence, when starting up crypto projects, founders must be careful with the choice of Dapp host blockchain.

The cryptocurrency was roughly flat for the last 24 hours, but is up 17% since it began its ascent last week. If it finishes the day with a gain, it would be up for eight straight days. Analysts are optimistic about bitcoin's prospects.  Checking the technical picture, Arcane Research says the $47,500 area has been important technical resistance since early 2021.

42410896,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggt3UC,1648578308,Tracking Luna Foundation Guard’s Bitcoin Purchases,"It was recently announced that the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), a nonprofit organization focused on the Terra blockchain protocol, might purchase $10 billion or more of bitcoin (BTC) to act as a reserve for the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin. While the specifics on how the BTC will be wrapped for use by the protocol are still in the works, thanks to the transparency of the Bitcoin blockchain we can see just how much bitcoin LFG has purchased.  Here’s how to monitor Luna Foundation Guard’s BTC purchases  CoinDesk has confirmed that the LFG’s bitcoin address is bc1q9d4ywgfnd8h43da5tpcxcn6ajv590cg6d3tg6axemvljvt2k76zs50tv4q.  The actions of the address – such as purchases or transfers – can be viewed using a block explorer or a full node. OKLink, a blockchain explorer, has also tagged the address as LFG’s. More conveniently, there is a Twitter bot that tracks the balance of the LFG wallet. As a result, we can track LFG’s progress as it builds up its bitcoin reserve.  As of writing, LFG is in the process of raising $3 billion, most of which has already been raised, to buy bitcoin and has purchased almost 28,000 bitcoin, worth ~$1.3 billion. Given the indication that LFG intends to hold more than $10 billion in bitcoin, there is more purchasing that LFG needs to do. Absent any large moves in BTC price, that could mean ~180,000 bitcoin of purchase volume in the coming months. Given there is more than $20 billion of bitcoin trading volume each day and that LFG has made most of its purchases in ~$125 million lots, it won’t have any issues filling its purchase orders.  Still, this is a meaningful slug of purchase demand.  What this could mean  Bitcoin has always been a permissionless, decentralized network that powers a fully transparent asset. So, if successful, UST could become a dollar stablecoin backed by a fully transparent asset. Right now, collateralized stablecoins like USDT and USDC are backed by dollars in reserve, but the amount of backing is only verified by accounting firms’ assurances. A dollar stablecoin with provable reserves might be seen by some analysts as an improvement on the current collateralized stablecoins where users need to trust, rather than verify, assets in reserve.  Read more: Just as Hal Finney Predicted, Bitcoin Is Being Purchased to Act as a Reserve Currency  This could be an important development for stablecoins. Stablecoin trading pairs – say, UST for ether (ETH) – make up a significant majority of crypto trading volume and, beyond that, they have potential payment use cases. As the economy, crypto or otherwise, increases dependence on stablecoins, the reliability of their peg becomes paramount. An important stablecoin project moving to a bitcoin backing could prove a useful development in the journey for fiat-pegged digital cash.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | LUNA | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/29/tracking-luna-foundation-guards-bitcoin-purchases,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b5d1e519e1f3e0545869799c9dc7cb0e82f363d-4288x2848.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394273,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvapZL,1648577202,"Chris Larsen’s Plan to Greenify Bitcoin: Risky, Impractical and Maybe Nonsensical","Call it proof of chutzpah.  Chris Larsen, one of the co-founders of beleaguered crypto-payments company Ripple, has devoted a reported $5 million of his personal fortune to a public campaign seemingly aimed at making bitcoin (BTC) greener.  In partnership with Greenpeace and other organizations, Larsen is funding a series of ads over the next month calling on bitcoiners to “Change the Code, not the Climate.” The goal, according to Bloomberg, is to pressure the Bitcoin community to make a transition away from power-intensive proof-of-work mining to a proof-of-stake system that uses much less energy.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  At first glance, Larsen’s suggestion is appealing. The environmental impact of proof-of-work mining is perhaps Bitcoin’s most substantive drawback and a continuing headwind for the overall public perception of crypto. For example, the rhetoric of environmental damage has helped generate major and sometimes misplaced hostility to non-fungible tokens (NFT) in the art world.  But the reaction to Larsen’s effort among industry leaders and observers has been disbelief and suspicion. That’s in part because, however warm and fuzzy Larsen’s goal seems to be, the campaign’s recommendations are extremely risky, thoroughly impractical and perhaps even nonsensical. More importantly, Larsen’s motives for the proposal are extremely suspect: After all, as a co-founder of Ripple, he has arguably spent the last decade in competition with Bitcoin.  The incredible risks  The first problem with Larsen’s agenda is that switching Bitcoin to proof-of-stake security would involve incredible risk. The change would be so fundamental that it probably couldn’t be implemented with a conventional “hard fork,” in which some network members go to an incompatible version of the Bitcoin software. Hard forks have been used to create modified versions of Bitcoin before, most prominently with the Bitcoin Cash secession from Bitcoin in 2017.  But Bitcoin Cash and similar forks only altered technical parameters already defined within the proof-of-work system, such as block size. A proof-of-stake system operates on fundamentally different security architecture, and so rather than changing existing parameters, a proof-of-stake-based Bitcoin would likely involve a ground-up redesign. Rather than a mere “fork,” that would involve a much more complex project of migrating existing wallet balances to a new network with the “Bitcoin” name.  Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake shows what this might look like. Ethereum 2.0 won’t be a direct continuation of the current Ethereum chain, but a managed transition to a new system. A “Beacon Chain” for the new system has been running in parallel with Ethereum 1.0 for years now, and merging the two has been carefully managed by a strong core group of Ethereum companies and developers.  There’s little chance of a similarly aligned and influential group emerging to manage such a transition for Bitcoin. One reason is persistent distrust of proof-of-stake security itself: “Proof of Stake is not only less secure, it is completely pointless and insecure,” pseudonymous bitcoin advocate Gigi argued on Twitter. “Without PoW, any system will become political, moving conflict resolution to a quorum.”  See also: Musk Learns the Hard Way: Crypto Doesn't Need a Savior  Many in the Bitcoin ecosystem also have interests and agendas that could diverge sharply once major network changes are on the table. For instance, bitcoin miners who have spent millions of dollars on specialized chips called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) for proof-of-work mining are radically unlikely to support a proof-of-stake transition.  Furthermore, as former CoinDesker Noelle Acheson points out, truly transitioning Bitcoin to a new model would likely require convincing all those miners to stop extending the proof-of-work chain. That would in turn require persuading exchanges worldwide to stop trading tokens from the PoW chain – a nearly impossible task.  A strong reaction  These realities help explain why Larsen’s proposal has been met not just with disagreement from bitcoiners, but with vociferous and frequently extremely personal repudiation. Bitcoin, just like Twitter or Facebook, depends significantly on “network effects” – it is more useful, the more people use it. While a proposal like Larsen’s might have zero chance of convincing every bitcoiner to switch to a new proof-of-stake system, it might sway some of them, triggering a “hard fork” in the community, if not in the network proper.  See also: What Jamie Dimon Doesn't Understand About Bitcoin | Opinion  That fragmentation could weaken Bitcoin – and Larsen’s background seems to have invited uncharitable speculation about the campaign's real intentions. Over the course of the past decade, Ripple has often seemed to argue that the XRP token created by its co-founders is a superior system to Bitcoin, and the company has sold over $1.3 billion of the token to the public despite relatively little success in its plan to create an interbank transfer system.  That has led to a massive, ongoing battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and left many bitcoiners with enduring hostility to Larsen and the entire Ripple organization, which many see as inherently and deeply hostile to Bitcoin.  Ryan Selkis, founder of Messari, a crypto data provider, responded to news of Larsen’s campaign by declaring that “The Ripple execs are scum.” Matt Walsh of Castle Island Ventures, a broadly BTC-aligned venture firm, Tuesday morning alluded to Larsen as making “billions dumping unregistered securities that look like fidget spinners on retail investors then [using] the proceeds to lecture actual entrepreneurs on their bitcoin businesses.” (Ripple’s logo resembles the popular toy.)  For his part, Larsen told Bloomberg, “If I was concerned about Bitcoin as a competitor, probably the best thing I could do is let it continue on this path … This is just an unsustainable path.”  The debate about Bitcoin and energy is still very much a live one, and Larsen’s doomsday warnings could well prove correct. But he’s clearly not the right messenger.  UPDATE (MARCH 29, 2022 – 19:55 UTC): Corrects quote attribution.",NEGATIVE,XRP,BCH | ETH | MINING | XRP | FORKS,David Z.

42394272,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvapUD,1648576293,"Europe’s Landmark Crypto Regulation Is Advancing, but New Privacy Rules May Be More Important","Holy heck, was last week busy or what? Legislation in India and Europe took center stage, but there's a lot happening pretty widely. I’m going to take a second to shamelessly plug the CoinDesk regulatory team here because there's too much to run through in one newsletter – if you’re not following these folks, you’re missing out: Sandali Handagama, Jesse Hamilton, Cheyenne Ligon, Amitoj Singh, Lavender Au and Jack Schickler.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  The European advance  The narrative  The European Union is advancing its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation but lawmakers and proposed rules around anonymous transactions may be a more pressing concern for the industry.  Why it matters  MiCA seems to be moving forward. If implemented, it promises to dramatically streamline the launch process for crypto companies trying to set up shop in more than one of the European Union’s 27 member nations. However, separate from MiCA, another set of proposed rules that will be voted on this week promises to make using crypto a bit more difficult for companies and users.  Breaking it down  Bitcoiners can breathe a sigh of relief. A controversial proposal to limit proof-of-work mining in the European Union will not be part of the EU's landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework.  MiCA has advanced from a negotiation stage where lawmakers proposed and debated different provisions to a point where the different branches of the European government will discuss the bill. We are now going to see what's called a trilogue, which my colleague Sandali Handagama explains is when the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council all debate and agree on the legislation as it currently stands.  Meanwhile, a couple of thousand miles away in India, a controversial and equally disliked tax proposal has become law after the nation’s Parliament adopted it late last week. This tax provision will implement a 30% capital gains tax on all crypto transactions as well as a 1% tax deducted at source. Advocates for the industry feared this will lead to “brain drain,” or an exodus of developers and entrepreneurs in the cryptosphere from India to other, friendlier jurisdictions.  So basically, it was a pretty big week last week.  What we're seeing now is just a continuation of this idea regulators accept that crypto is here to stay and want to do something about it. In India’s case, much like last year’s U.S. infrastructure bill debate, that “something” is “tax the industry,” even if the specific circumstances are a bit different.  However, crypto industry participants in India have said they’re concerned by the fact the country hasn’t put forward any sort of guidance or regulations for startups and other businesses to operate under, instead leaving the regulatory framework at just the tax level issue.  Europe’s MiCA is a vastly different approach in that regard. The key benefit for the industry should MiCA be implemented is the common license for crypto businesses, allowing a company to operate across borders.  That being said, while MiCA is advancing (despite last-minute efforts to include a limit on PoW mining), the crypto industry should pay attention to some other rules in the works. From my colleague Jack Schickler:  “Members of the European Parliament are likely to vote to end the anonymity of even small crypto payments at a committee meeting to be held next week, documents seen by CoinDesk show.  These proposed rules would require exchanges to identify the recipients of crypto transfers. At present, recipients of bank transfers worth more than 1,000 euros have to be identified, but the proposed legislation would remove that minimum limit for crypto transactions.  The new proposed rules may also make it difficult for crypto exchanges to allow transactions to tax havens, which include the Virgin Islands (both U.S. and U.K.), Turkey, Hong Kong, Iran and others.  And in an episode that many readers of this newsletter might remember, the EU also wants to enforce anti-money laundering (AML) checks on private/self-hosted (or unhosted or whatever you’d like to call them) wallets.  Wallet owners would need to be identified, according to the proposed rules.  The industry is already pushing back against these rules, claiming they would make it difficult for people to use self-hosted wallets and enforce strict surveillance against crypto exchanges.  Statements such as those made by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, Tracfin Director Guillaume Valette-Valla or the Bank of England underscore that many in the EU may not be comfortable with the crypto industry yet.  FY 2023  U.S. President Joe Biden unveiled his fiscal year 2023 budget request Monday, outlining an ambitious plan to tackle ongoing supply chain issues, tax billionaires and boost police budgets. And he may raise some $11 billion over the next 10 years by modernizing digital asset taxation rules.  The modernization would include amending mark-to-market rules for digital assets, modifying rules outlining the loans of securities and amending securities loan nonrecognition rules.  “The proposal would amend the securities loan nonrecognition rules to provide that they apply to loans of actively traded digital assets recorded on cryptographically secured distributed ledgers, provided that the loan has terms similar to those currently required for loans of securities,” the Treasury Department’s Green Book (explanation of the budget asks) said.  Another provision addresses Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requirements and other foreign account holders, similar to last year’s budget proposal.  “In addition, tax evasion using digital assets is a rapidly growing problem. Since the industry is entirely digital, taxpayers can transact with offshore digital asset exchanges and wallet providers without leaving the United States,” the Green Book said.  The budget proposal also includes a provision increasing the Department of Justice’s budget by $52 million to tackle investigations, including its ransomware work and combating illicit uses of cryptocurrency.  While it doesn’t explicitly mention crypto, the proposal would also boost the Securities and Exchange Commission’s enforcement budget, which I imagine will go, at least in part, to furthering crypto investigations and enforcement actions.  Other budget increases include $210 million for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), $1.1 billion overall for the Internal Revenue Service and boosts for other agencies.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) presented its own budget request, saying it “expects to register and oversee a growing number of derivatives exchanges offering novel and complex products,” including cryptocurrency-related products.  The CFTC also expects some decentralized exchanges or peer-to-peer networks to try and trade cryptocurrency derivatives without registering with the agency in the U.S.  It remains to be seen whether any of this comes to fruition: Congress would have to authorize the budget through legislation rather than kick the can down the road with temporary continuing resolutions, as we’ve seen over the past year.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam will testify before the House Agriculture Committee on Thursday. It’s not yet clear whether crypto will come up but I imagine it will, given the congressional agriculture committees have oversight jurisdiction over the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Speaking of which, the CFTC is at full strength. The U.S. Senate confirmed Christy Goldsmith Romero, Kristin Johnson, Summer Kristine Mersinger and Caroline Pham as CFTC Commissioners. Two of them – Goldsmith Romero and Johnson – highlighted their work with cryptocurrencies in their opening remarks at a confirmation hearing earlier this month.

Will Belarus Lure Crypto Miners Amid Sanctions, Russia-Ukraine War?: Belarus participated in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last month and was immediately slapped with sanctions.

City of Austin Approves ‘Fact-Finding Study’ for Tax Payments in Bitcoin, Crypto: The leadership of the city of Austin, Texas, approved plans to look into crypto and whether it can be used for tax payments, among other items.  Kraken Hits Key Milestone in Quest to Gain Fed Account, Equal Treatment With Traditional Banks: Kraken Bank received an American Bankers Association routing number, but I think the real news may be the Federal Reserve published a supplemental request for information last week asking for public input on a proposed three-tiered system for evaluating whether financial entities should have access to master accounts. Recall that the Fed first published an RFI last year outlining some of its considerations for master accounts.  White House Wants Public Comments on Crypto’s Energy Use and Environmental Impact: So this is part of U.S. President Joe Biden’s executive order on crypto, but it’s interesting that the White House is asking for comment and – similarly to the EO itself – not explicitly saying crypto is leading to climate change. “Digital assets may present a key environmental challenge … On the other hand, digital assets might also have a positive impact on the climate. For example, they may provide new opportunities in carbon accounting and verification, increasing trust in carbon measurement and creating a novel opportunity for addressing climate change,” the RFI says.  Outside CoinDesk:  (Platformer) Casey Newton took a look at ApeCoin and its role in the broader Bored Ape ecosystem – specifically, the role venture capital firms might play in it.  (The Washington Post) The Washington Post and CBS News reported that conservative activist Virginia Thomas, who also happens to be married to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, was actively texting former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows in support of a now repeatedly debunked conspiracy theory that Joe Biden stole the 2020 presidential election.

The gaming-focused Ronin network announced Tuesday a loss of over $625 million in USDC and ether (ETH).  According to a blog post published by the Ronin network’s official Substack, the exploit affected Ronin validator nodes for Sky Mavis, the publishers of the popular Axie Infinity game, and the Axie DAO.  UPDATE (March 30, 13:23 UTC): Ronin Hacker Unlikely to Cash Out ‘GDP-Sized’ Haul, Experts Say  An attacker “used hacked private keys in order to forge fake withdrawals” from the Ronin bridge across two transactions, as seen on Etherscan.  While the Ronin sidechain has nine validators requiring five signatures for withdrawals and is meant to protect against these types of attacks, the blog post notes that “the attacker found a backdoor through our gas-free RPC node, which they abused to get the signature for the Axie DAO validator.”  The blog post pegged the losses at 173,600 ether and 25.5 million in USDC, currently worth in excess of $625 million.  Back in August 2021, a hacker made off with $611 million in an exploit of cross-chain decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Poly Network. The vast majority of the funds were returned.  The Ronin attacker’s Ethereum address is a fresh address that transferred ETH in from the Binance exchange one week ago. Etherscan records show that the attack took place last Wednesday.  The majority of the funds remain in the attacker’s address, though 6,250 ETH has been transferred to various other addresses.  The Ronin Bridge and the Katana automated market maker (AMM) have both been paused while investigations are ongoing.  “We are working directly with various government agencies to ensure the criminals get brought to justice,” the blog notes.  The price of RON, the native token of the Ronin network, is down 27% on the news, according to CoinGecko.  UPDATE (March 29, 16:20 UTC): Adds price of RON.

He’s one of the more high-profile visual artists to venture into NFTs; Damien Hirst, another artist known for splashy, commercially minded projects, made similar moves last year.  The twist for the Koons effort is that, in a nod to a longstanding crypto meme, these sculptures are literally going “to the moon.”  Per a press release, a subset of the physical pieces in “Jeff Koons: Moon Phases” will “make a lunar landing on an Intuitive Machines Nova-C Lunar Lander, to be launched on pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center in a fully autonomous mission.” They’ll end up in Oceanus Procellarum, on the near side of the moon.  It’s a collaboration with Pace Gallery’s dedicated crypto arm, as well as two lesser-known private companies experimenting with art and tech: 4Space, founded by Chantelle Baier, and NFMoon, also founded by Chantelle Baier along with an investor named Patrick Colangelo. Intuitive Machines, the company that built the lunar lander in question, is also involved.  Read more: Damien Hirst's NFT Experiment Explores Burning Question  Koons NFTs  Koons’s works remain the priciest of any living artist. He’s best known for a series of giant, stainless steel balloon dogs, which are beloved by collectors and often dismissed by critics (he began his career as a commodities broker on Wall Street – which is to say, he knows a thing or two about what sells).  Though Koons began teasing his NFT project this past winter, there are still no details about the pieces themselves.  Said Koons, in a prepared statement: “I wanted to create a historically meaningful NFT project rooted in humanistic and philosophical thought. Our achievements in space represent the limitless potential of humanity. Space explorations have given us a perspective of our ability to transcend worldly constraints.”  The “to the moon” concept is also a reference to the trajectory of NFT art, which, until early 2021, was mostly dominated by crypto memes – imagery along the lines of bulls astronauts, and physical bitcoins. You can see the remnants of that style in the work of the NFT artist Beeple, who famously sold a token for $69 million last year.  The Koons launch is being planned for later this year, and proceeds from “one of the first NFT sales” will be donated to Doctors Without Borders.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | SPONSORED,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/29/jeff-koons-first-nft-project-is-a-riff-on-cryptos-moon-meme,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1e63fbacbbefd169888461307453211ef79ce6d7-4128x2747.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

PayPal’s (PYPL) Edwin Aoki and Jose Fernandez da Ponte – the chief technology officer of blockchain, crypto and digital currencies, and the unit’s senior vice president, respectively – told Cowen their company for the moment intends to work within the crypto ecosystem, rather than launching a proprietary product.  The report noted that they see room for the use of a number of types of digital assets and tokens – stablecoins and CBDCs among them – but believe decentralized cryptos (i.e., bitcoin) may not work as well due in part to scalability issues.  Visa (V) Chief Financial Officer Vasant Prabhu reiterated his company’s enthusiasm for digital currencies and its goal of being a bridge between the crypto and fiat worlds. In similar fashion to the PayPal executives, Prabhu told Cowen that Bitcoin has “limitations” in payments due to volatility and speed.  Summing it up, the Cowen team, led by Managing Director George Mihalos, called bitcoin as a payments medium “a far less elegant approach with stablecoins and potentially CBDCs offering a superior solution.”  Read more: EBay Teases 'Digital Wallet' in Investor Presentation as Crypto Rumors Swirl",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Michael Bellusci,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/29/fintechs-see-strongest-payments-challenge-from-stablecoins-and-cbdcs-not-bitcoin-cowen,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f2a639515642f35135276592cc0ec95bb8086972-8256x5504.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With the momentum now behind bulls, what might this mean for the cryptocurrency market in the weeks and months ahead? The MACD And Bullish Weekly Bitcoin Momentum Markets are always seeking equilibrium. When a large move materializes, the same momentum that carried an asset upward, pulls it downward when the trend begins to topple.

42423624,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2cKDh,1648565531,Bitcoiners Scoff at Chris Larsen's $5M Campaign to Force a BTC Code Change,"The bitcoin (BTC) community is reacting harshly and incredulously to a planned ad campaign by Ripple co-founder and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen and Greenpeace USA that would advocate a code change to reduce the energy use of the largest cryptocurrency by market value.  The Wall Street Journal first reported the news late on Monday. Larsen confirmed the campaign and explained his thinking on Tuesday, tweeting out a subsequent report by Bloomberg along with some comments.  The campaign aims to change bitcoin's proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm, which requires vast amounts of energy. Larsen is putting $5 million into the ad campaign, which is dubbed “Change the Code, Not the Climate” and set to roll out over the next month, according to Bloomberg. The campaign will run ads in leading publications such as the New York Times, Politico, The Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch and on Facebook, and some of the ads will take aim at bitcoin's most famous supporters including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Block (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey and Fidelity CEO Abby Johnson, according to a press release from the organization.  The chances of such a measure being implemented from the top down, without widespread consensus, are dubious, however. The organization claims in its press release ""that about 50 key miners, exchanges and core developers have the power to make a software change."" But an attempt five years ago to make a major change to the software failed, despite the backing of some of the largest startups in the industry, because of user backlash.  On Twitter, Larsen recognized efforts efforts from miners Gryphon Digital Mining, Argo Blockchain (ARGO) and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) to use renewable energy, but said many other miners ""are repurposing old coal & gas plants and not being responsible stewards of the amount of power they’re increasingly using."" Using renewable energy is not a long-term solution because the PoW system incentivizes miners to find the cheapest energy, he argued.  Larsen didn't specify what system he prefers to replace bitcoin's PoW, but praised Ethereum's decision to move to a proof-of-stake (POS) model. Ripple, which is chaired by Larsen (and is fighting allegations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it sold the XRP cryptocurrency as an unregistered security), will not be involved in the effort, he said.  The reaction from bitcoin proponents was swift and harsh.  Read more: Can Crypto Miners Make the World Greener?

The sponsor Next Earth is the third-largest metaverse project, with more than 30,000 virtual landowners, 180,000+ registered users, and 2,500+ transactions. The platform was created to become a self-sustaining, self-regulated not-for-profit supporting environmental causes on Earth, and has donated $1 million to environmental initiatives since launch in Q4 2021. CodeCluster is a culture-first web and app development shop. The vision for Crypto CTF was conceived at the beginning of 2019 by Six, and the first round was played during the BsidesBUD information security conference. Since then, each event has seen an increased number of participants and sponsors.

42423641,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2cR9h,1648562465,"Prime Trust, Swan Bitcoin Link Up on Crypto IRA Product","Fintech firm Prime Trust on Tuesday announced a platform for creating crypto-based individual retirement accounts (IRA) in an expansion of the API provider’s Web 3 footprint.  “For retirement funds, one of the most important things is to diversify,” Chief Product Officer Sara Xi said in a phone call with CoinDesk. She said Prime Trust’s Crypto IRA will make doing so easier for those who want crypto in their portfolio.  The program is only open to Prime Trust clients during a beta period that will test funding and investing retirement accounts with crypto.  IRA accounts offer retirement investors a tax-efficient alternative to long-term buying and holding. While they’re nothing new to the crypto industry, Xi said Prime Trust’s API solution is notable in covering the full account setup, funding and trading lifecycle.  Prime Trust Crypto IRA will support digital assets supported by the company's Liquidity API integration, although Xi expects that most users will be risk averse, and will opt to fund their accounts with market leaders like bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH).  One early client of the program, the sats-stacking Swan Bitcoin, is using Prime Trust to help employees contribute crypto to their IRAs. CEO Cory Klippsten told CoinDesk that the additional tax advantage of investing in crypto makes the retirement solution enticing for clients.  However, crypto IRA products are not without risk. Xi addressed that potential users recognize that crypto is volatile. And the February hack of IRA Financial and Gemini led to the theft of millions of dollars in crypto from retirement savers, highlighting the threat of security breaches in the world of digital asset management.  Xi explained Prime Trust's two-fold strategy of insuring against hacks and serving as custodian will protect users’ keys and keep their nest egg secure. A trust license holder in the state of Nevada, Prime Trust’s “job is to safekeep assets” she said.  The beta program will onboard clients such as crypto exchanges, lending platforms, and wealth management platforms ahead of the June 1 launch and public rollout in the fall. Xi said the beta will work to satisfy Swan and other clients while working out “operational kinks.”  CORRECTION (March 31, 19:00 UTC): Earlier versions of this story misstated how Prime Trust handles digital assets in relation to its IRA product, and which digital assets are in play.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/29/prime-trust-swan-bitcoin-link-up-on-crypto-ira-product,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b329b717998af17f8ad2641769ea8290fd122901-1500x952.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The loan was given through the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) Leverage program, which issues U.S. dollar loans using bitcoin as collateral. The loan was collateralized with about $820 million worth of bitcoin, according to a regulatory filing.  Shares of MicroStrategy were flat during premarket trading.  MicroStrategy, a software company, has become known more for its embrace of bitcoin. In the fourth quarter, the company took a nearly $150 million impairment charge on its bitcoin holdings because of the cryptocurrency's price drop.  The interest-only loan is secured by a certain portion of bitcoin held in MacroStrategy’s collateral account, which has a custodian agreed upon by both parties.  MacroStrategy can use the loan to purchase bitcoin or pay interest and fees related to the loan or for MacroStrategy’s or MicroStrategy’s general corporate needs.  Launched in 2020, Silvergate’s SEN Leverage program had $570.5 million in commitments at the end of last year, according to the press release.  “The SEN Leverage loan gives us an opportunity to further our position as the leading public company investor in bitcoin,” MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor said in the press release. “Using the capital from the loan, we’ve effectively turned our bitcoin into productive collateral, which allows us to further execute against our business strategy.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | SPONSORED,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/29/microstrategys-unit-gets-205m-collateral-loan-from-silvergate-to-buy-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c972cad05c8cdeb02567dfc6b6f87ddf65017000-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto has reached the $2 trillion threshold and is proving surprisingly resilient in the face of global uncertainty. As of Tuesday, Bitcoin has totally recovered from its early-year losses. BTC fell from $47,733.40 to $35,070.10 in the first 30 days of the year and has since failed to regain ground. At Monday&apos;s all-time high of $47,765, market leader bitcoin broke free from the confined $34,000-$44,000 bracket it had been trading in for the majority of 2022.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Calm in credit markets likely helps bitcoin and equities look through sustained rise in bond yields.  Featured stories: Ether's net issuance points to supply squeeze ahead.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Ben Gagnon, chief mining officer, Bitfarms  Jeff Dorman, chief operating officer, Arca  Robert Bogucki, managing director and global co-head of trading, Galaxy Digital  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Both crypto and stock markets continue to overlook a sustained rise in bond yields, and that resilience perhaps stems from the calm in credit markets.  ""There’s no stress in credit markets, so until that happens, you’ve got to sit on the bid, really,"" David Belle, founder of Macrodesiac.com and U.K. growth director at TradingView, tweeted. Credit markets had turned jittery following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.  Bitcoin remained on the hunt for the 200-day average placed at $48,250, after it narrowly missed testing that critical technical resistance level on Monday.  The futures market exhibited a bullish tone, with the one-month contract listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange trading at an annualized premium of 6%, the highest since mid-December, according to data provided by Skew. The dollar value locked in the CME-based open futures contracts rose above $3 billion for the first time this year. The exchange is considered a proxy for institutional activity.  Premium on other exchanges remained under 5%, signaling a lack of conviction among retail traders about bitcoin's price rally.  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency and the native token of Ethereum's blockchain, topped $3,450 for the first time since Jan. 6.  Programmable blockchain Terra's LUNA token hit a record high of $105.91. ""Sentiment for LUNA has grown in the past month largely due to the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), a Singapore-based nonprofit that is purchasing over $3 billion worth of bitcoin as an additional layer of security for UST, Terra's decentralized dollar-pegged stablecoin,"" CoinDesk's Shaurya Malwa noted.  From a technical analysis perspective, the focus was on LUNA's ability to keep gains above the $100 mark. In recent weeks, the token has failed multiple times to establish a foothold above that psychological level.  WAVES, the native cryptocurrency of Waves blockchain, which enables users to create and launch custom digital tokens, surged over 50% to a record high of $52. The surprise launch of Waves Labs, a U.S-based venture to support, develop and incubate commercial opportunities for the Waves blockchain, likely lifted the token higher.  ""Waves Labs is a key component of the Waves plan to grow exponentially in 2022. Despite a period of record growth of our ecosystem, Waves still remains relatively unknown in the U.S. crypto space. With the founding of Waves Labs, the ecosystem fund, and the extremely talented team in place, I do not doubt that Waves will reach mass adoption in 2022 and beyond,” Sasha Ivanov, founder of Waves, said in a press release.  WAVES has rallied more than 300% this month to top the list of best performing cryptocurrencies with market values of at least $1 billion.  Other significant gainers of the day were RUNE, LRC, FIL and ETC.     Latest Headlines  Hashdex Appoints Ex-21Shares Director Laurent Kssis as Europe Head  Bitcoin Nears 200-day Average Ahead of Seasonally Bullish Period, Triggers Over $400M in Liquidations  Dapper Labs, Ether Capital Headline Newly Formed Canadian Web3 Council  WisdomTree Launches Crypto ETPs for Solana, Cardano, Polkadot in Europe  Terra’s LUNA Set New Highs of Nearly $106  Ex-Employee Claims Liquid Global Exchange 'Scapegoated' Her for $90M Hack  Ether's Impending Supply Squeeze  By Omkar Godbole  Ether's net daily emission, or the daily supply adjusted for the number of tokens burned, appears to be trending south, providing bullish cues to the native token powering Ethereum's blockchain.  Data tracked by IntoTheBlock shows ether's net issuance declined by 2,960 ETH to 6,170 ETH on Monday, the lowest daily figure since Feb. 24. The metric has dived out of an uptrend.  ""After peaking on March 12, the net daily emissions appear to be decreasing as the demand for the network increases,"" IntoTheBlock said in a broadcast on the Telegram messaging app. ""ETH has not had a deflationary day since Feb. 2, but this might change soon.""  A continued decline in the issuance could accelerate ether's rally. The cryptocurrency has risen nearly 40% to $3,470 in two weeks, thanks to optimism surrounding the impending merge of Ethereum's proof-of-work and proof-of-stake chains.  ""The approach of Ethereum’s merge is galvanizing interest in the potential impact on ETH’s price,"" Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at CoinDesk's sister company Genesis Global Trading, said in an email.  Ether's pace of supply expansion has slowed since the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-1559 was implemented in August. The upgrade introduced a mechanism to burn a portion of fees paid to miners. Since then, more than 2 million ETH – worth over $5.78 billion – have been destroyed, leading to a net supply reduction of 65.2%, according to data source Watch the Burn.

42423638,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2cR1h,1648558859,"Hedera, Newly EVM-Compatible, Woos DeFi With $155M HBAR Fund","The latest big-budget decentralized finance (DeFi) incentive program is coming from an unusual source: Hedera Hashgraph, an enterprise-focused mainstay from 2017 known for its blockchain-like distributed ledger technology (DLT).  In a press release on Tuesday, the HBAR Foundation, the developers of Hedera, announced a $155 million “Crypto Economy Fund” with a focus on DeFi.  Hedera will be a late entrant to the DeFi race. An official website reports that the chain currently accounts for $50 million in total value locked (TVL), but popular DeFi tracking platform DefiLlama doesn’t list Hedera among 83 other chains.  With a gaudy incentive program and the recent addition of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, the HBAR Foundation is hoping to follow the same playbook used by other layer 1s such as Near and Fantom to climb the TVL rankings.  Read more: Near Protocol Offers $800M in Grants in Bid for DeFi Mindshare  In an interview with CoinDesk, HBAR Foundation Director Elaine Song said that $60 million of the fund is allocated specifically as liquidity mining rewards for decentralized exchanges, while the remaining funds will be used for infrastructure-focused grants.  In some ways, the fund signals a strategy shift for the developers of the chain.  “Hedera has always been focused on enterprise, and even within enterprise focused on a discrete use case, which is efficient distributed ledgers and throughput,” said Song. “There is another exciting part of the industry focused on retail and adoption, however.”  Song also mentioned environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts and a major retail-focused staking effort led by Stader Labs, the first recipient of a grant from the program.  “I would hesitate to call it a pivot, but it’s broadening our scope and taking what we’ve learned in the last two years and reshaping it in a way that’s meaningful and usable by the average retail user,” said Song.

42423651,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2cRJh,1648558800,Binance Upgrades Blockchain Bridge to Connect DeFi and CeFi,"Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has launched the second iteration of its cross-chain protocol that connects its flagship layer 1 blockchain, BNB Chain, with other chains.  Binance Bridge 2.0 will be compatible with more blockchains, feature a better user experience and decrease maintenance costs, the firm said in a press release shared with CoinDesk on Tuesday.  The bridge will allow users to access traditional centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) via the Binance app. Decentralized finance refers to financial activities carried out on the blockchain without any intermediaries.  Binance rebranded its layer 1, or base, blockchain to BNB Chain in February as it pushed towards being a key blockchain infrastructure provider. The bridge is an important element of that push, as it allows users and developers to bring other tokens to Binance's ecosystem.  Through the bridge, users can bring unlisted tokens on BNB Smart Chain as B-Tokens, the press release said. B-Tokens are tokens pegged to the value of some underlying cryptocurrency. This technology, known as wrapping, is used to move tokens from one blockchain protocol to another by essentially mirroring them.  Tokens that are listed on Binance's crypto exchange will be stored in Funding or Spot Wallets, whereas unlisted tokens will be saved on Funding Wallets. BNB Smart Chain is a blockchain that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), where smart contracts are executed. Funding wallets facilitate peer-to-peer transactions.  The bridge comes with a new automated circulation control system for B-Tokens, which will only keep a buffer surplus of the wrapped tokens in hot wallets and mint new ones when users bring tokens from different blockchains on BNB Smart Chain. The rest of the circulating supply of tokens will be backed by the native tokens bridged to Binance's ecosystem.  Separately, BNB said that scaling platforms Celer, Ankr, and NodeReal launched the first BSC Application Sidechain (BAS) testnet.

42423644,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2cRFh,1648558800,Blockware Solutions Builds 20MW Bitcoin Mining Data Center in Kentucky,"Blockware Solutions, the privately held crypto mining and infrastructure company, has built a 20-megawatt (MW) mining facility in Belfry, Kentucky, the first of three planned sites in the region.  The data center will allow customers to co-locate their mining rigs and has been testing with select clients since January, according to a press release. The facility’s power capacity could also be expanded to as much as 75MW.  “The new 20-Megawatt data center will facilitate professional mining that will give individual customers total control over their own mining activities,” the company said in the statement.  Blockware Solutions CEO and co-founder Mason Jappa said a primary reason for Blockware to start its mining operation in Kentucky is the state’s pro-crypto mining stance.  “Kentucky was the first state, in my opinion, in the United States to pass a House and Senate bill that actually incentivized bitcoin miners with tax and other initiatives,” Jappa said.  Kentucky had about 12.4% of Foundry USA Pool's U.S.-based bitcoin (BTC) mining hashrate, the second highest after Georgia’s 34.2%, according to a March 2 tweet from Foundry. Foundry is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which is the parent company of CoinDesk.  Kentucky also boasts low cost power and sustainable energy sources as well as a good climate for mining operations, Jappa said.  Blockware doesn’t provide its power costs but according to the Global Energy Institute, in 2020 average retail electricity price in the state was $0.0856 per kilowatt hour, compared to $0.0858 in Texas and $0.149 in New York.  Read more: Blockware Raises $25M to Expand Bitcoin Mining Operations in Kentucky  Blockware’s data center is located on the eastern Kentucky and western Virginia border, where its mountainous climate is cooler, said Jappa. A colder climate, as seen in places like Canada, Norway and Sweden, helps with the air cooling of the mining rigs without requiring additional costs for temperature management.  Blockware has deployed mining computers, including Bitmain’s S19s and WhatsMiner M30S++, at the new site. Future batches of S19 XPs planned for later in the year, Jappa said.  Revitalizing the community  Blockware is repurposing old manufacturing and coal plants in Belfry and using them for bitcoin mining while providing jobs for the communities, according to Jappa.  Blockware, however, is not using coal energy to power the new data center, rather, the power is coming from the grid, which uses about 65% sustainable energy, according to Jappa. This puts Blockware above the 58.5% sustainable energy mix miners globally are now utilizing, according to the Bitcoin Mining Council’s estimate.  “It is my hope that a region known for mining coal will now benefit from this different type of mining,” Kentucky state Rep. Angie Hatton said in the statement. “It means a lot to see Blockware Solutions invest here and create these jobs, and I also hope that its significant electricity needs will help stabilize our steep residential rates,” Hatton added.

42423642,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2cR7h,1648556969,Delphi Digital Leads $5M Seed Round for Money Market Protocol ZkLend,"ZkLend, a layer 2 money market protocol built on zero-knowledge rollup product StarkNet, has raised $5 million in a seed funding round led by crypto research firm Delphi Digital and with participation from Three Arrows Capital and StarkWare. The capital will go toward the launch of the company’s core products, as well as to expanding the technology, marketing and business development teams.  “Money markets are a core component of the [decentralized finance] financial stack with strong existing product market fit. Couple a money market with the technical prowess of StarkNet’s decentralized ZK rollup, which is live and proven, and you have zkLend,” said Delphi Ventures co-founder and partner Tom Shaughnessy in a statement.  StarkNet is a layer 2 product that addresses Ethereum’s key scalability issues of slow throughput and high transaction fees. ZK rollups bundle hundreds of mathematically validated transactions into one, then write that transaction to the Ethereum blockchain, cutting down on traffic and fees.  StarkWare, the parent company of StarkNet, raised $50 million in funding at a $2 billion valuation last November.  How it works  ZkLend has two key products. Artemis, a permissionless lending offering open to anyone with an internet connection, will launch in the third quarter of 2022. With Artemis, users can deposit assets to earn yield and can borrow using those assets as collateral. Deposits from multiple investors are collected in pools to facilitate the loans, which have real-time, liquidity-variable interest rates.  The Apollo product, launching early next year, is for institutional and corporate users needing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. Institutional investors include financial institutions, prop shops (a type of trading firm that invests its own money) or even corporate treasuries, zkLend co-founder Jane Ma said in an interview with CoinDesk.  “As [decentralized finance] becomes more mainstream and institutions start looking into adoption, we understand that there’s going to be a lot of compliance barriers that come into play. Apollo can serve as a gateway for these institutions,” said Ma, noting that institutions have to be verified and approved before entering the protocol.  ZkLend’s investment deck further outlines the importance of institutional investments in crypto: “The next chapter of DeFi is institutional. Institutional CeDeFi is the next finance paradigm as institutional capital and legacy infrastructure enter the arena.”  Incentives  ZkLend is backed by the native ZEND token. Users who borrow or lend assets within Artemis can earn tokens in what zkLend calls an “ouroboros” model, named after the mythical snake that eats its own tail. Users who stake ZEND will be eligible for governance rights and claims to the interest income earned by the deposit pools.  “We want to reward borrowers because they’re the ones paying interest on their loans,” explained Ma. “If you’re borrowing in some of the pools with higher interest rates, we really want you to participate and we might offer a more attractive reward.”  Why StarkWare?  ZkLend plans to use the new capital to build out the team, including a chief compliance officer and institutional sales people for Apollo. Ma said the protocol will hire two to three developers since StarkWare doesn’t natively support Ethereum Virtual Machine, which means the rollups have to be done through Cairo, a relatively new programming language  StarkWare isn’t the only layer 2 ZK rollup platform. Competitors include zkSync from Matter Labs, as well as Polygon Hermez. Last summer, layer 2 Ethereum platform Polygon merged with decentralized ZK rollup platform Hermez in a $250 million deal in a major sign of support for ZK technology.  So what led zkLend to choose StarkWare?  “We decided to go with StarkWare because we thought they were the farthest in terms of development progress and we felt the team was extremely experienced,” said Ma. “That’s not to say in the future we won’t look at other ZK layer 2s.”  Read more: StarkWare Launches Layer 2 Product StarkNet on Ethereum",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | ZK,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/29/delphi-digital-leads-5m-seed-round-for-money-market-protocol-zklend,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6bbbb68575a5730f249f2ba60a982f9e99a7f26-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cryptocurrency's immediate prospects look bright, according to seasonality analysis.  The top cryptocurrency rose past $48,000, the level last seen at the end of December, and nearly challenged the 200-day moving average located at $48,250.  Technical analysts and traders track the chart's current level to its 200-day moving average to gauge underlying strength in the market. A decisive move above or below the average often yields notable rallies or declines. The cryptocurrency's sell-off deepened following the break under the average in early January.  Monday's move higher triggered market-wide short liquidations worth over $300 million, the highest single-day tally since at least early December, according to Coinglass.com. Meanwhile, exchanges liquidated long positions worth $180 million. Liquidation refers to the forced closure of long/short futures market positions due to margin shortage.  The large number of short liquidations indicates the market was skewed bearish and perhaps traders were caught off guard by the cryptocurrency's breakout of a two-month triangular consolidation.  The recent move higher has indeed been steep. The cryptocurrency has rallied 25% in two weeks on a string of factors, including continued purchases by Luna Foundation Guard to build a reserve for its stablecoin UST and the post-Federal Reserve risk reset in the stock markets.  ""We have the continued buying support from Terra’s Luna Foundation Guard. We’re approaching the month and quarter-end, which could be triggering some position build-up,"" Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at CoinDesk's sister company Genesis Global Trading, said in an email. ""There are almost daily reminders in headlines of the value of a seizure-resistant, easily portable, independent store of value, and this is likely to continue to boost BTC interest.""  ""We have also seen some significant signs of growing institutional support – just over the past 10 days, we’ve had statements from Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Cowen, Bridgewater and Virtu, all signaling growing conviction that the crypto markets are worth dedicating more resources to,"" Acheson added.  There has been renewed investor interest in bitcoin and crypto-linked investment vehicles. For instance, inflows into ProShares' bitcoin futures-linked exchange-traded fund (ETF) have recently picked up the pace, pushing the year-to-date rise in the asset under management to 11%, according to data tracked by Kaiko Research.  ""Inflows accelerated in March, suggesting improving investment appetite for this type of instrument after investors de-risked their portfolio aggressively in early 2022,"" Kaiko's weekly newsletter published Monday said.  CoinShares's latest weekly fund flow report shows investment products for digital assets drew $193 million last week, the highest weekly inflow since early December.  The bullish momentum looks set to continue as, historically, April has been a positive month for the cryptocurrency. Data provided by charting platform TradingView shows bitcoin has chalked up gains in April in seven out of the past 10 years. In the remaining three years, bitcoin suffered meager losses of 1% to 3%.  Lastly, bitcoin's weekly chart is showing signs of bullish revival. ""Bitcoin has cleared recent highs near $45.0K and has a new weekly MACD “buy” signal, suggesting the current relief rally has staying power,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said in a weekly newsletter published Monday.  ""We move to an intermediate-term bullish bias noting intermediate-term momentum has shifted positively and the 50-day MA is pointing up,"" Stockton added.  The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is one of the most popular indicators for gauging trend strength and momentum. A crossover above the zero line represents a bullish shift in the momentum.

Although trading volumes on the weekly timeframe remain small, the NEO price begins the reversal process. Relatively increased trading volumes during the trading week of 14 February showed buyers where there is a local barrier to growth. This is the $27 mark range. After the meeting of NEO price in this range a month and a half ago, sellers became significantly more active. The main advantage of buyers at the moment is the confident retention of control over the mark of $18. This mark has historical significance. In history, we see that for 2.5 years, buyers could not break this markup. It was taking it under control in December 2020 that created a new era in the NEO market. https://www.tradingview.com/x/3Dq9Z7Bw/ Therefore, a rebound from this mark is extremely likely to happen. The main question is how long it will take buyers to gather strength and what is the final growth target. As the NEO price moves in consolidation, a re-test of the $18 range can be expected. In this range, there will be a great chance to buy NEO with low risks. The first medium-term growth target of NEO is $60. Sellers are more likely to activate near this mark. It is at this point will understand the balance of power in the NEO market and whether to expect continued price increases.

Such remarks are probably made by investors to this cryptocurrency. The fact is that the XEM price began a downward trend even before it became mainstream in November. Beginning in September 2021, buyers stopped updating local highs and formed a clear fall channel. As a result, sellers were able to test the range of $0.09. This range is the main hope of buyers to stop the trend of decline and likely reversal in the market. It is from this range that buyers have been able to raise the XEM price by 170% since June 2021. But, analyzing the movement of the XEM price in the range of $0.09 now it seems that the price is no longer interesting to investors. Starting from the trading week on 17 January, the XEM price is moving in this range. If in June 2021 we saw a sharp buyout and an aggressive reversal - now we see a passive consolidation near the range. https://www.tradingview.com/x/QzQnraJJ/ In addition, the trading volumes during the $0.09 test is not increased and is just as low. This fact directly indicates the absence of an aggressive buyer. Of course, there is a high probability that after a long-term consolidation in the range of $0.09-$0.14, buyers will gain strength and start a new growth wave. However, even in this case, the main target, where it would be good to fix their long positions is at $0.22.

Will the buying sustain so that the uptrend hits $250? Key technical points: The post-retest rally would soar XMR price by 15% The rising 20 and 100-day EMAs provides a bullish crossover. Finally, the 24-hour trading volume of Monero is $174.1 Million, marking a 1.86% rise. Past Performance of XMR On February 25th, the XMR price rebounded from the $140 support with a long-tail hammer candle. Since then, the altcoin has been rallying higher under an ascending trendline. The recovery rally breached several critical technical levels on its way, such as $182, $210, and 200-day EMA, and it currently exchanges hands at $221, with a 50% gain since the last month. Source-Tradingview XMR Technical Analysis The XMR price rally sabotages the long-coming resistance trendline to showcase the uptrend. Furthermore, it has recently pierced the $210 resistance, indicating the buyers are ready for another leg up. However, the coin price could pull back to retest the breached resistance, validating a sufficient bullish momentum. Moreover, until the support trendline is intact, traders can maintain a bullish bias for the Monero coin. The recovery rally regains the crucial EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200), indicating the buyers have the upper hand.

According to the data published and endorsed by the World Bank, only 69% of the world&apos;s adult population has an account. Although financial inclusion is the enabler for seven out of the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals, 1.7 billion people are unbanked.

Despite the decline over the year, a large amount of the coin was never sold. A scenario that shows how holders strongly believe in the long-term game and remain surprisingly calm over a period of turmoil. Building Up To A Rally Senior Analyst Dylan LeClair noted that, as Bitcoin is trading at around $48,000, &apos;there has only been one other time that the percentage of supply that hadn&apos;t moved in over a year was at this level,&apos; which was during September 2020. On the mentioned date Bitcoin recovered from the dramatic crash of march 2020. The strong bounceback saw a 185% hike in the prices, taking to coin to over $10,000. A high number of committed &apos;hodlers&apos; had also kept their BTC dormant despite the extreme swings in prices during the year. This was followed by a performance that catapulted Bitcoin&apos;s reputation amongst investors as &apos;digital gold&apos;. It closed the year trading at record highs of close to $30,000, outperforming gold with an increase of 416% over the year.

Finally, the 24-hour trading volume of EOS is $1.62 Billion, marking an 85% rise. Past Performance of EOS The EOS coin price showed an unprecedented growth of 50% last fortnight, bringing the price closer to the $3 mark with the 50 and 100-day EMA breakout.

According to a comprehensive 2021 Clario analysis, social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook, capture 69-80% of their users&apos; personal data. So, in that context, if the controversial Meta-backed Diem digital currency finds success in reaching the general public, the Mark Zuckerberg-owned company will inevitably gain access to its users&apos; transaction data as well. Put differently, if Diem sees the light of the day, Meta will not only know who you are, what you do for a living, and what you enjoy, but they will also know what you buy, when you buy, and how much you spend. Luckily, ZCash is one of the leading digital currency blockchains that aspires to address this developing problem and give its users back control and privacy.

A close above $105 would thrust LUNA to new 2022 highs. Past Performance The LUNA coin is in the top-10 by market cap but trailing BTC and ETH. Overall, LUNA is steady versus the USDT and up roughly five percent in the past trading week. Technically, the Terra coin is bullish, inside a bull flag with resistance at $105. Terra Technical Analysis As aforementioned, the Terra coin is consolidating within a bull flag with resistance at $105. As per the LUNA candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, the middle BB and the support trend line is the immediate support level. A break below $90 and $84 in the near term may see the coin slide back to $77. Nonetheless, buyers have the upper hand from an Effort-versus-Results perspective, provided LUNA prices are trending inside the March 8 and 9 bull bars. Therefore, they may find entries with immediate targets set at $105. What to Expect from LUNA? LUNA is near its peaks and may surge higher as its ecosystem emerges as the most valuable in DeFi. Losses below $90 complete a double top at $105, while a close above would see LUNA prices trend in new 2022 highs.The post Terra in a Bull Flag, will LUNA bulls Break $105? appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | LUNA,BTC | ETH | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/terra-in-a-bull-flag-will-luna-bulls-break-105/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

Marisa McKnight, Liquid Global’s former head of product and marketing in Japan, where the company is based, claims that she “was simply being used as a scapegoat for the hack” of the exchange disclosed on Aug. 19, 2021. The company claimed hackers stole around S$97 million (about US$71 million) worth of digital currency, the filing says.  The size of the hack was later reported to be $90 million, and Liquid later obtained a $120 million loan from crypto derivatives powerhouse FTX, which eventually agreed to acquire Liquid outright for an undisclosed price. That deal was expected to close this month.  McKnight’s statement of claim says:  Quoine did not inform McKnight internally about the hack despite the fact that she was in charge of communicating relevant social media posts from the Japan office.  She felt increasingly excluded and isolated; she resigned via email on Sept. 15, 2021.  In her exit interview, Chi Tran, Liquid Global’s chief marketing officer, and Graeme Doherty, the chief information officer, informed her that investigative bodies were waiting to investigate her in the United States and Japan, and that evidence pointed to her work laptop being involved in the hack. McKnight “strenuously denied any involvement in the [h]ack” during that conversation, the filing says.  She refused to travel to Japan or ship her laptop to Quoine “given baseless threats made against her” and the failure of Mike Kayamori, CEO of Liquid Global, to adequately address concerns she raised over email.  She was terminated on grounds of gross insubordination and a serious breach of obligations on Oct. 7, for which she maintains there were “no grounds.”  She is suing for the loss of 60 shares, worth $210,000, plus loss of reputation and loss of future employment opportunities.  Liquid did not respond to a request for comment by press time.
