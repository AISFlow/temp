42425266,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvoRh,1389372341,Bitcoin 'Needs to be More Accessible for the Visually Impaired',"Bitcoin may be touted as a global and accessible currency, but some of its users are being badly underserved.  Michael Staffen is a bitcoin user who is blind. He posted about his frustration with bitcoin wallets, which currently don't offer any accessibility options to visually impaired people, on reddit:  ""I am a fully blind person who uses a screen-reader and every bitcoin wallet I have downloaded is inaccessible to my screen-reader ... This is making me very annoyed as I am a bitcoin supporter and I have acquired my own bitcoin, I just can't goddamn use them without getting help from someone else.""  Staffen's reddit post attracted nearly 200 comments and almost 1,000 upvotes. The comments were largely positive, calling on wallet developers to provide accessibility features for blind bitcoin users.  A core developer working on Multibit, a popular open-source wallet, said he raised the issue with the Multibit developer community and had started beta testing for accessibility issues after seeing the post. He has also recruited Staffen as one of Multibit's beta testers.  Wallet accessibility    CoinDesk contacted Staffen to get a walkthrough of his experience using a bitcoin wallet with a screenreader. A screenreader is a piece of software that reads out the entire contents of a computer display and allows a blind or partially sighted person to operate the device.      [post-quote]    Staffen uses the market-leading third-party application JAWS. As he fired up his computer, JAWS called out his cursor's location on the screen.  Staffen said he uses only a keyboard to navigate through his computer. The screenreader read out each menu so quickly that Staffen had to slow it down for us to follow.  Firstly, he chose to demonstrate his problems with the the Bitcoin-Qt wallet. When the application launched, Staffen showed that he could only access the main menu bar in the application.  This menu bar contained three drop-down menus that allowed him to backup and encrypt his wallet, but did not allow him to perform basic functions like check his wallet address or send and receive bitcoin. Those features are accessed through buttons contained in the application's main window.  ""If I go to the Bitcoin-Qt wallet, I can get into menus like 'file', 'help' and 'settings', but I can't really do anything with them. There's nothing to [help me] hear what's going on. There's no interaction with the screenreader, so basically the wallet is useless to me, unless I get someone to help me."" He added:  ""For example, even getting to the [wallet] address, which I need to cut and paste – I can't even really do that.""  Staffen said his sister, who is also a bitcoin enthusiast, currently helps him access the wallet. However, Staffen says he's not pinning blame on a particular company or person for the poor state of accessible wallets.  ""Most people want to make it accessible, probably including the developers – they just haven't considered it. That's one of the problems around accessibility: It's not that people intentionally exclude others. It's also up to [people with disabilities] to make noise.""  Michael Staffen's story  Staffen (pictured) is a 36-year-old who lives in a town called Regina in a relatively rural province called Saskatchewan, which is part of the 'Canadian prairies'. He developed lymphoma, a cancer of the blood, four years ago.  When he was diagnosed, he was told he had stage-four lymphoma and that the cancer had spread to his central nervous system. He was given a bleak prognosis.  ""I was in a coma for a total of a month and was given a 0% chance of living. When I woke up from my coma, I could not see or move.""  The cancer had damaged Staffen's optic nerve, leaving him with no light perception. After a year-long stay in the hospital, where he received chemotherapy, he eventually started a physiotherapy regime to regain use of his body.  ""I did physiotherapy twice a day, where I learned how to walk and use my body again. I am now considered cured!""  Staffen is currently enrolled at the University of Regina where he is studying for a master's degree in public policy and administration. He expected to graduate in September.  He has also become active in the local technology scene, becoming a board member of a maker-space called Crash Bang Labs. When CoinDesk spoke to him, he was in the midst of monitoring his new litecoin mining rig.  Staffen got interested in bitcoin two years ago after hearing about it on a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio show, but was struggling to adapt to using technology as a blind person.  ""As a relatively new blind person I just did not have the wherewithal to go about [buying bitcoin in 2011] and wiring money at the time just seemed extraordinarily shady.""  By April of last year, Staffen was comfortable enough with technology to give bitcoin another go.  ""My sister and I teamed up to figure out how to buy bitcoins from Mt. Gox. We had to wire our money to Japan which seemed ludicrous and scary.""  Staffen was so enamoured with the digital currency that he used a cash advance from his credit card to get enough funds to buy some. Unfortunately for Staffen and his sister, they bought into the cryptocurrency at its April peak of about $250.  ""The price collapsed the very next day. I kept them because I thought they may recover eventually,"" he said. The cryptocurrency's price, of course, rallied to over $1,000 over the course of the year. It's currently about $850 according to the CoinDesk BPI.  MultiBit's perspective  Gary Rowe, a core developer on MultiBit, said the team is working on a new version of the wallet that would implement the Java Accessibility API recommendations.  This set of guidelines is designed to help developers create Java applications that are accessible to people with disabilities, including visual impairment or blindness. Rowe said he expected MultiBit HD to be released by the end of March at the latest.  ""MultiBit are committed to delivering code of the highest quality to a wide range of users. Some of those users require support for accessibility to make their experience of MultiBit better,"" he said, adding that Staffen is MultiBit's only visually impaired beta tester at the moment.  Assistive technology boom  Screenreader technology is becoming increasingly common on computing devices, led by a combination of consumer expectations, industry adoption and legislation, said Robin Spinks, the principal manager for digital accessibility at the Royal National Institute of Blind People, the leading charity in the United Kingdom.  The latest WebAIM survey of screen reader usage, for example, shows that adoption of the technology has grown from 12% to 72% in the last three years. WebAIM is a non-profit organisation focused on web accessibility solutions at Utah State University.  Apple  developed a screen reader and made it standard on iOS in 2009, a move that Spinks says sparked mass adoption of the technology. He said:  ""Apple has led the march on this and other companies are following in their wake. Leaders in industry are demonstrating that it's economically viable.""  As for Staffen, he says he plans to immerse himself further in the bitcoin economy. He's been thinking about developing an education centre for people to learn about bitcoin or a wallet that's accessible to blind users.  ""I'm not sure what the business will be yet, all I know is I want to make a living from it.""

42425268,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvoTh,1389365957,"A Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Bet, Making Cents of Twitter, and Indian Brews","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 10th January 2014 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.      Everyone has friends they love but secretly fear because of what they might do. John Law has one such friend who is particularly dangerous during the festive season. Probably a CERN particle physicist in a previous life, she delights in finding people at parties who are polar opposites and accelerating them towards each other at great speed to see what bits fly off.      She has a particular talent at finding denialists – climate change, evolution, moon landing – and plumping them in front of the unfortunate Law, who finds them all as unappetising as toad-in-the-hole made with real toad. Of course, 2013 was the year of the bitcoin …    Thus, Dear Lord, thus:  “Bitcoin expert, eh? Criminals and drug-runners love it.”  “It’s a ridiculous speculation. I’d say ban it, but let the suckers hurt. Hahaha!”  “My friend says that millions of computers waste megawatts of electricity on that. It’s killing the planet,” and so on, and so forth.    If it’s not possible to escape by pretending to speak nothing but Esperanto, then a game attempt to engage in battle takes place.      The electricity nonsense is simple: agree that bitcoin mining does indeed soak up power, “but so much less than the real thing, eh?”.      As nobody has the faintest idea how much energy mining metal and running the financial system takes up, this is an easy bluff to carry off. And certainly true, to boot. As for the rest, John Law is glad to report that this week alone has provided two excellent counter-examples against the inherent badness of bitcoin – one very small, one very big. The very big one has made all the headlines: the very small one is far more significant. Let’s start with the very big.    Overstock steps up    What sets it apart from the thousands of other outfits that take bitcoin is its size, over a billion dollars a year in sales. While this is no Amazon – it’s actually roughly the same as Greggs the bakers – it’s by far the biggest single organisation to hook its wagon to the cryptocurrency star. It’s also the only one approaching a household name.      John Law suspects this is far more a publicity stunt than a major revenue move, but probably not a cynical one. The CEO, Patrick Byrne, is no supporter of the status quo and clearly relishes rewriting rule books – and won’t mind one bit if the threat of bitcoin manages to drive down the transaction costs from banks for more traditional fund movements.      What this is costing him isn’t known, but he’s bitcoin-enabling courtesy of Coinbase – who will be hoping hugely to benefit from this vote of corporate confidence. Who’d be surprised if a mutually advantageous deal was struck between the two outfits?      Ah yes, banks. The selfsame banks who’ve been quick to close down the accounts of individuals or small businesses discovered meddling in bitcoin. It’d be a bold bank indeed who rid themselves of a billion dollar business. And even for organisations that habitually show less shame than a medieval monarch, it’s going to be hard for them to take Byrnes’ bucks but shun the little guys. That sort of behaviour gets regulators quite irate.      Any way you cut it, Overstock’s practical involvement in bitcoin is of major significance in the progress of the feisty digi-dosh – and it’s only a week into 2014. What could be more exciting?    Strictly for the birds    Oh, and to get bitcoin more widely accepted. What it isn’t, is out to make any money or open new avenues of lawlessness or make ego-drenched superstars of its creators. This is important stuff, because it passes the two most significant tests of any innovation: do people want to do this, and could this be done any other way?      Clearly they do want to do this – there are already others working on making it better – and no, there is no other way of moving small amounts of money across Twitter, at least not without ludicrous amounts of complexity and expense that makes the whole business pointless.      This test isn’t met by the Overstock move – yes, people want to buy stuff from Overstock, but they can already do it with much less fuss and no particular extra expense through plastic or PayPal.      And at some point, there’ll be another Biggest Ever retailer, even bigger than Overstock, who’ll adopt the cryptocurrency. It’s a good story, but it doesn’t say much about bitcoin.      Back at TipperCoin, the nascent service is growing in some odd directions. One is the inclusion of Dogecoin, the mutant currency based around a bizarre, dog-themed Internet meme that John Law has already tipped for greatness. OK, mentioned in awe and incomprehension. That counts.      TipperCoin is already an offshoot itself, from work done previously in adding microtransactions to reddit usage, and because it’s open source and based in a lively community of skilled yet twisted developers, such mutations can be produced in days. With nobody in charge and no investors calling the shots, this thing could spread wherever people wish – and, in fact, will be a lot harder to shut down than anything more normally structured.      As principal perpetrator Scott Li said when asked if Twitter approved – don’t know, but we’re too small to matter. Such is the very spirit of bitcoin, and it’s this DNA which is the important core of the whole idea.      Will TipperCoin make a big difference? It might: we just don’t know what will happen when it’s painless to throw a couple of cents at somebody who made you laugh for a second through a clever tweet. It might sink without trace, and probably will, but an experiment that couldn’t have been done before has been attempted.      Which is how things change, after all.    Tea totals    And if you, like John Law, are giving body and soul a month-long refreshing break from the rigours of indulgence, you too may be contemplating a nice cup of tea. Even here, bitcoin is shaking things up.    The Tea Board of India – unfortunately not a cool electronica band – is perplexed by the way some of its growers are bypassing all governmental oversight and revenue monitoring by selling their goods directly online and taking payment in, well, you guessed already. Questions are being asked in Parliament.    India is addicted to bureaucracy. It has a labyrinth of boards, ministries, agencies and regulators, state and national, which seek to authorise, deny, monitor and control virtually every commercial act that might conceivably happen. It makes Labour’s post-war British statism look like Ayn Rand’s fondest fantasy.      No wonder bitcoin seems like a tempting sword with which to slice the Gordian knot. No wonder the masters are deeply concerned. As with China, it’s impossible to know exactly what the result will be.      Probably, just a storm in a … oh, never mind. Is January over yet?

42376817,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eVjv,1389362379,New Filipino Bitcoin Exchange Targets Remittance Market,"A new bitcoin exchange, BuyBitcoin.ph, has officially launched in the Philippines.  Unlike many other exchanges popping up around the world, it is not headed by a couple of anonymous coders working out of a garage.  BuyBitcoin.ph  , co-founded by four bitcoin enthusiasts from all corners of the globe, doesn't want to be 'just another exchange'. It appears the company is pinning its hopes on remittances, which makes a lot of sense. There are an estimated 2.2 million Filipino expats around the world, and last year they sent over $13.9bn back home. This is obviously a huge untapped market.  Where to buy  Filipinos looking to buy bitcoins can simply walk into one of 800 branches of the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) and make a deposit. BuyBitcoin.ph is working to add a few more payment options, but so far the focus appears to be on good old fashioned cash.  However, since the focus is on remittance, most people will probably use the platform for bitcoin to fiat conversion. At the time of writing, the buy/sell exchange rate was 38,616.53/34,965.92 Philippine peso per bitcoin, which works out to $782/$864. At the same time, the CoinDesk Price Index stood at $850.  Remittance is just the beginning  BuyBitcoin.ph co-founder Lasse Olesen points out that the Philippines is one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia, and the third-biggest global market for remittances. Olesen told TechInAsia:  “Many online transactions here are being made by cash deposits in physical locations, and bitcoin is cash for the internet, so it’s a good fit. [It’s also] incredibly empowering for the self-employed freelancer or merchant.”  “It gives you instant access to a global market where you can receive payments practically for free and, if you want, exchange to cash locally. If you’re a small merchant, accepting international payments through PayPal or bank wires is just not feasible with their fees.”  Thanks to Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network, remittances could be significantly cheaper and faster than traditional wire transfers, but to make it all a reality, a good local exchange is needed. This is what BuyBitcoin.ph is all about.

42376821,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eVnh,1389355212,South America Gets Its First Bitcoin ATM,"South America will get its first bitcoin ATM in two weeks, according to Brazilian bitcoin exchange Mercado Bitcoin.  The ATM, a Lamassu unit, will make its debut at the Campus Party technology event in São Paulo, Brazil.  Mercado Bitcoin's  CEO Rodrigo Batista said the ATM would be installed at one of the 300 booths at the massive annual technology gathering, which is expected to attract more than 100,000 visitors. The machine will be available to the public for the duration of the event, which runs from 27th January to 2nd February. He added:  ""The ATM is a way to bring people to bitcoin. Most of the people at the event, even though it's a technology audience, will have never heard of [bitcoin].""  Mercado's Bitcoin ATM is a Lamassu unit, so it only converts fiat currency to bitcoin, and not the other way around. The machine will charge a 2.5% fee for each transaction, which is the same amount Mercado Bitcoin customers pay.  Batista said the machine would be installed permanently somewhere in São Paulo's financial district after the event.  ""It will be one of the districts that's the equivalent of Wall St; we are already talking to some bars and restaurants.""  The ATM will not require identification documents from its users for a transaction. It will also be limited to relatively small transactions of 100 Brazilian real (or about 50 US dollars).  Brazilian bitcoin scene  Despite Mercado Bitcoin's early start in bitcoin, the Brazilian economy in the cryptocurrency is still nascent, according to Batista. Uruguayan company Moneero has announced plans to install its own ATMs in that country, but it's unclear if the machines have been installed yet.  Moneero hasn't responded to an e-mail seeking clarification yet. A check on CoinMap, the open source map of merchants who accept bitcoin, shows only four listings for São Paulo, for example.  ""Brazil is like one year behind the US and Europe [in terms of bitcoin adoption] and [the rest of Latin America] are one year behind Brazil,"" he said.  One merchant who accepts bitcoin payments at his nutritional supplements store in Duque De Caxias, a city in the Rio De Janeiro Metropolitan Area, says he's noticed an uptake in interest in bitcoin among Brazilians on bitcoin forums and among listings for mining equipment on marketplaces since September.  The merchant, Sergio Murilo Da Silva Rocha, has completed 18 bitcoin sales since he started accepting the digital currency two months ago:  ""The biggest change I noticed is from September. It is spreading fast.""  About Mercado Bitcoin  Batista's company, Mercado Bitcoin, is an early bitcoin exchange that was established in 2011. According to Batista, the exchange trades about $4m worth of bitcoin and $3m worth of litecoin each month.  Mercado Bitcoin was also in the news when it helped set up a paywall for Brazilian technology magazine Superinteressante that allowed readers to pay in bitcoin. Rodrigo said his company is also working on a payment gateway for merchants, to encourage adoption of bitcoin payments.  Rodrigo worked as a software developer for enterprise software at Morgan Stanley in Brazil before he acquired a stake in Mercado Bitcoin. He said he first bought the cryptocurrency in 2012 after reading an article about it in Superinteressante.

42376811,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eVdd,1389349851,Will Electronics Retailer Newegg Follow Overstock's Lead and Accept Bitcoin?,"Newegg, the online electronics retailer worth at least $2bn in annual revenue, has tweeted yet another hint that it will begin accepting bitcoin payments in the near future. The California-based company posted this teaser today:  There has been much online speculation over the past month as to what Newegg might be planning. A company of this size accepting bitcoin would be one of the biggest gestures toward mainstream bitcoin acceptance yet.  On 24th November, Newegg was asked by @thedatascape on Twitter whether the company would accept bitcoin. The following response came:  https://twitter.com/Newegg/statuses/404299166261981184  It is still unclear when Newegg will make a formal announcement, or launch a bitcoin pilot. But with Overstock.com coming online with bitcoin payments through Coinbase six months ahead of schedule, the pressure is on.  US retailers going global  One interesting phenomenon that has emerged over the last couple of years may be working in bitcoin’s favour. Black Friday sales are going international, as more and more non-US consumers are getting in on the act.  Although the rest of the world does not celebrate Thanksgiving, everybody loves cheap electronics, and massive Black Friday discounts are making them attractive to overseas buyers too.  [post-quote]  Bargain hunters are not only looking for low prices and holiday bundles – they are looking for a cheap way to make their purchases, without the usual credit card charges. US e-tailers are simply trying to adjust.  Many have been curious about bitcoin, but seem to be waiting for better payment (and legal) structures to exist before leaping in. With smaller technology and online businesses paving the way, it would make sense for large electronics stores to come next.  Shopify announced  it would introduce bitcoin payment options for its independent merchants in November. Overstock.com is an online retailer but it deals mainly in household goods, so it was surprising to see its CEO being the first to announce a plan to accept bitcoin. Heads turned even more toward businesses with customers more likely to be bitcoin enthusiasts, like Newegg.  According to MarketLine research, online retail in the US alone was worth $200.4bn in revenues in 2012. It probably comes as little surprise to discover the electronics segment is the most lucrative of all, its customers supplying 21.9% (or $43.8bn) of that total.  Having experienced a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% between 2008 and 2012 despite the economic hard times, online retail as a whole is projected to grow to $371.4bn by 2017.  Other online retailers are no doubt salivating at the thought of keeping more of that revenue in their own accounts, rather than handing it over to banks and credit card companies. They might, however, want to observe for a while to see how certain bitcoin-related vagaries are handled before joining in.  Still hurdles to overcome  There are consumer protection issues like how to properly identify and resolve fraudulent purchases, and how such things can be proven. Then there's price volatility: currently, this is handled by payment processors like BitPay and Coinbase who can instantly convert bitcoin to USD before the price fluctuates. But these online retailers are in a new league, and their revenues on a much larger scale.  If large-scale online retail with bitcoin proves to be successful, it won't just be only other retailers looking on hungrily. The IRS will definitely be looking for its share, and some in government still bristle at the idea of large-scale adoption of a currency not under state control.  California's Newegg has long been a favorite online retailer for technology fans. Launched in 2001, its popularity grew quickly and Internet Retailer Magazine named it one of the Top 10 online retailers in 2005. The company went public in September 2009 and in 2010, generated $2.5bn in revenue. It has been profitable every year of its existence.  It also has local stores, in Canada, China, and Taiwan and operates a number of more specialized stores and brands, including NeweggBusiness.com.

42376823,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eVqD,1389346231,"Sun, Beers and Bitcoin in Santiago","Bitcoin is gaining momentum in South America with a nightclub in Santiago now accepting bitcoin as payment for beers, burgers and cocktails.  The California Cantina, a trendy restaurant, sports bar and nightclub in the Providencia neighbourhood of the Chilean capital, claims to be the first nightclub in South America to accept bitcoin payments. The owner, James Lyles, says a friend introduced him to bitcoin and he was immediately blown away by the potential:  “I just found that it was one of those things that was going to make paying and the transactions between people a lot easier. And it takes out the financial institutions, the partners we would rather not have,” he said.  Credit card charges  In Chile, credit card companies charge an additional 3 - 3.5% per transaction. This adds up to hundreds of thousand of peso each year, according to Lyles. Right now, about 70% of all payments in California Cantina are made with credit cards, but Lyles hopes to be able to cut that down by 10% within the first few months by promoting bitcoin payments. This, he says, will lead to “huge savings”. He added:  “We will start it as a trial and see how it catches on. But there are a lot of people in Chile that are starting to buy bitcoin and a lot of the international people here who are all over it.”  The bar started accepting bitcoin payments on Wednesday night, when it held a large meet up and party that drew a large crowd to the nightclub. Joining them for the occasion was Nicolas Cary, CEO of Blockchain.info and Adam Stradling, the founder of Coin4ce, the Santiago-based bitcoin company that will process the payments in Californian Cantina.  Taking time out from the festivities, Stradling said that bitcoin is gaining a momentum in Latin America. The currency's major hub is still Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, where a number of restaurants, bars and clothes stores accept bitcoin for payments. Buenos Aires also has the highest number of bitcoin users in Latin America, but Stradling says that Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico are waking up to bitcoin and catching up fast.  “Two years ago when we started trading here in Chile nobody knew what was going on. Now, two years later, the newspapers have been writing about bitcoin every day for months,” he said.  QR codes  For California Cantina, Coin4ce has created a pesos to bitcoin market rate converter that creates a QR code for each transaction for bars and restaurants. A waiter or waitress can just bring over an iPad, enter the bill amount, and generate a unique QR code to receive the payment from the customer. Coin4ce is also working on a bitcoin wallet for the Chilean market together with Blockchain and they hope to expand their operations to Peru, Colombia, and Mexico in the near future.  Nicolas Cary is also sensing a new understanding of bitcoin in Latin America. Last time he visited to talk about bitcoin and Blockchain, he said he sounded like an “extraterrestrial” to most people.  But now everyone from taxi drivers to bar owners and business leaders have an opinion on the subject: “the usefulness of [bitcoin] for people here is becoming really clear,” he says.  Lyles maintains that financial incentives were the main motive to accept bitcoin. However, he is also excited about the project on a personal level, to be a part of the future and to stay ahead of his competitors:“If you are not getting used to it now, you will be forced to get used to it later,” he said. “So, we might as well be ahead of the curve”.  So, if you fancy a holiday with sun, beer and a way to spend your bitcoin, head to the South American summer and Santiago for a bitcoin holiday. You can even book your flight on Btctrip, the Argentinian bitcoin travel agency.

42376803,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eVW5,1389315389,Taxpayer Advocate to IRS: We Need Bitcoin Guidance,"A lack of tax guidance on bitcoin is leading to confusion and misperceptions among US businesses and could even encourage tax avoidance, warned a Treasury-appointed spokesperson today.  Nina Olson, the Taxpayer Advocate, put pressure on the IRS in her annual report to U.S. Congress. Olson is the head of the Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent organization within the IRS that represents taxpayers.  Olson singled out a lack of IRS guidance around bitcoin and other virtual currencies as a particular issue of concern in this year's report, listing it in the ""most serious problems"" section.  “Legitimate businesses – those who want to comply with the rules and do not want to be associated with tax invaders or criminal enterprises – have urged the government to issue the rules about the tax consequences of digital currency transactions,"" Olson said in the report.  The National Taxpayer Advocate had already asked for tax guidance in 2008. The IRS had begun assessing tax compliance risks from virtual economies in 2007, and published information on its website on the tax implications of virtual economy transactions in 2009. This advice didn't specifically cover digital currencies, however.  A gap in specific guidance from the IRS on bitcoin and other digital currency has left individuals and businesses scouring the Internet for often inaccurate information, Olson warned, adding that many would be surprised to hear that capital gains could be imposed on bitcoins.  Several pressing issues  Olson identified several issues needing firm guidance from the IRS. Existing tax forms require US citizens and residents to report foreign accounts holding more than $10,000, for example. It is unclear whether this includes bitcoin.  Coinbase, which provides payment processing services for vendors, failed to respond immediately to questions about its compliance with that form, entitled Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR), but rival payment processor BitPay confirmed that it did list compliance with the form in its merchant terms and conditions.  Olsen also highlighted state tax law as a potential future challenge. Several state-level bills would force out-of-state vendors to collect sales tax on sales to in-state residents. ""These bills only provide full sales tax collection when the seller knows the purchaser's address,"" the report said. That is naturally a problem for bitcoin-enabled vendors, who may not have that information. ""For all these reasons, bitcoins could become more popular as a result of this legislation,"" said Olson.  Senator Tom Carper, who has been outspoken about bitcoin’s potential as recently as this week, praised Olson’s comments on bitcoin and tax guidance.  “I believe that the vast majority of these consumers want to play by the rules and do the right thing when it comes to complying with federal tax law as it pertains to digital currencies, but they can't do that until the Internal Revenue Service does its job and issues the rules of the road that all must abide by,” he said.  “I am hopeful that the new Internal Revenue Service Commissioner, John Koskinen, takes these recommendations to heart and acts expeditiously to provide thoughtful guidance to taxpayers regarding the use of digital currencies.”  This isn't the first time that the IRS has been accused of dragging its feet on digital currency taxation guidance. Earlier this year, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a report recommending informal guidance to at least give the public some information about how to report bitcoin income. At the time, the GAO’s director of tax issues James White told CoinDesk that the IRS was ""running to keep up"".  The IRS has so far given no specific date for further guidance on the taxation of digital currencies, but has indicated that it is working on the topic.
