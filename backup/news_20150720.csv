42398504,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbURxx,1437428813,Event Highlights Bitcoin-China Real Estate Connection,"Attendees of a recent Arcadia Association of REALTORS (AAR) event in California were each given $1 worth of bitcoin as part of a 9th July talk centered on the technology.  The California-based trade organization offers behind-the-scenes services to real estate agents, including continuing education on subjects relevant in the San Gabriel Valley. The event was the organization's first aimed at highlighting bitcoin and its potential use cases in real estate.  According to event emcee and Meson.re CEO Ragnar Lifthrasir, the emphasis for his talk at AAR centered on how bitcoin could be used in the lucrative international real estate trade as it relates to California.  With Meson.re, he said, his business focus is on helping mainland Chinese investors purchase real estate in the US, though Lifthrasir argues the service provides a prime example of how bitcoin could increasingly play a role in the real estate industry at large.  Lifthrasir told CoinDesk:  ""I think there's understanding of the problem and why there's a need in China. They immediately got it. There are two ways to buy [now], the black and the gray markets. The black market is you know someone who knows someone and the gray market is I don't know how it works but they money gets there.""  Using these options, Chinese investors purchased $22bn in real estate in 2013, up from $10bn in 2011 and accounting for 25% of all US house acquisitions by foreign buyers. Much of this sales process today involves complicated workarounds that could be simplified with bitcoin.  As for its part, the AAR felt this use case relevant due to the attractiveness of California real estate to Chinese buyers, though it said it is agnostic on the technology.  ""Bitcoin is in the media and in the news,"" AAR CEO Andrew Cooper said. ""We wanted to educate our members on how it's being used for real estate so they can have it top of mind if their clients ask for more information.""  Tough questions  The big opportunity, he explained to an audience composed of real estate agents hoping to lure investors from China, lies with a Chinese law that limits wire transfers to $50,000 annually per person, a restriction not currently applied to bitcoin.  Lifthrasir noted that his audience was receptive to this broad message, but that he was asked sometimes tough questions about whether bitcoin could serve the needs of potential clients.  For example, he suggested that one participant asked if bitcoin potentially violated the spirit of the law, and would therefore be only a limited-time option for Chinese buyers.  Lifthrasir, however, rebuffed these concerns, noting that bitcoin is being used to circumvent capital controls in Argentina, Greece and other struggling economies.  ""I wouldn't consider it a gray market, what we're doing is legal,"" he explained. ""You can buy as much bitcoin as you want and there's no issue with that. We help clients acquire bitcoin and if they want to purchase the property we help them convert that into dollars.""  Lifthrasir compared bitcoin favorably to the current system, suggesting that existing alternatives could also be considered loopholes.  ""You don't have to compare us to perfection, just compare us to the other options,"" he said.  Growth potential  While Lifthrasir isn't sure every attendee walked away from the two-hour talk with a solid grasp on the topic of bitcoin, he expressed his optimism it could emerge as a viable solution given recent volatility in the Chinese markets.  ""When I left the presentation I was disheartened, a lot of them didn't get it,"" he said. ""[But] in the last few weeks we gained interest in what's been happening in their stock market, freezing their ability to move in and out of financial instruments.""  Perhaps given this connection, Lifthrasir's talk was profiled by Chinese-language news outlets, though its reports also hinted at the confusion of some talk attendees.  Meson.re has not yet facilitated any sales as a result of the event.  Still, AAR's Cooper chose to emphasize that the conversation remains useful given that bitcoin is projected to penetrate international commerce and cross-border payments.  Cooper went on to suggest that increasing awareness is a solid outcome given that many people simply don't understand bitcoin.  ""Attendees weren't necessarily into purchasing bitcoin on their own but wanted to learn how it would work in real estate,"" he said, concluding:  ""The feedback we got was tremendous.""

42398498,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbURs3,1437425471,London Police Warns of Bitcoin Ransom Scam,"A UK cybersecurity watchdog has issued a warning about new bitcoin ransomware attacks disguised as messages from several government agencies.  According to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB), unknown parties have been reported spoofing emails from the UK Home Office and Ministry of Justice, as well as from domestic energy giant British Gas.  The emails are being used to distribute TorrentLocker, one of a number of malware variants that, when activated, lock up a user's files unless a ransom in bitcoin is paid. A report last year found that the vast majority of TorrentLocker victims opt not to pay.  The NFIB indicated that malicious attachments as well as links to websites are being used to distributed the ransomware. In some instances, affected users are being prompted to fill in a captcha code after being warned about bills or unspecified legal action.  The notice further advised potential victims to back up their data and to report any incidents to cybercrime authorities.

42398501,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbURv0,1437415842,Deloitte Backs Bitcoin Accounting Standards Effort in Australia,"Professional services company Deloitte has partnered with an Australian digital currency trade group to develop new accounting guidelines for businesses that handle bitcoin.  According to a report by Australian business news service iTnews, Deloitte will cooperate with the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA) as part of a working group focused on accounting and self-regulation standards.  Deloitte Australia partner Jonathan Perkinson told iTnews that ""digital currencies have a lot of momentum"" and that more work is needed to clarify key tax and regulatory issues.  ""With ADCCA, we’ll be working on the strategic, tax and regulatory changes that will need to happen, and we’ll be recommending and challenging specific changes in those arenas,"" he said.  The news comes after Deloitte told CoinDesk it had spent the last year and a half investigating bitcoin and the blockchain for potential business applications.  ADCCA counts 18 regional businesses as members, according to its website. Founded last year, the group aims to be the key representative for companies working in Australia's digital currency and financial tech ecosystems.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2015/07/20/deloitte-backs-bitcoin-accounting-standards-effort-in-australia,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/abe91d8b9acd2ebd1c5a5c2be2cf8e8b96585842-2560x1664.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398511,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbUS1t,1437408027,Coins.ph Launches Peer-to-Peer Bitcoin App for Southeast Asia,"Bitcoin services firm Coins.ph has launched Teller, a mobile app that matches up its customers in Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand via the blockchain as a way to facilitate financial services.  Teller users who want to access funds for mobile phone top-ups and remittances, for example, can use the app to find a third-party seller to accept local currency, allowing the buyer to gain access to digital money.  All transactions are denominated and held in local currency, with Coins.ph using the blockchain as the rails to facilitate the exchange of funds.  Coins.ph  CEO Ron Hose indicated that he sees Teller as the next step in the company's mission to move money services ""off the financial grid"" in the Philippines. The launch is the latest for the platform, which also offers merchant payment processing and the ability for customers to withdraw bitcoin funds into cash at select bank ATMs.  Hose told CoinDesk:  ""We’ve been getting really good traction with our existing bills, payment and money transfer services after shifting to using blockchain in the background. We think this is the natural progression as far as being able to reach customers.""  Abra connection  Hose further acknowledged that the app bears a similarity to the much-anticipated remittance app Abra.  Though it was launched just four months ago, former Netscape director Bill Barhydt's project has already proven to have an outsized influence in the evolution of thought regarding how bitcoin can be used to impact the $435bn remittance industry.  Abra's app, which eschews connections to the traditional banking system by turning app users into mobile money exchange kiosks, has been lauded by VCs for its disruptive potential, and at least in the short term, its ability to sidestep onerous remittance regulations.  However, Hose sees Teller as a different take on the Abra model, given that Coins.ph provides additional services to local users.  ""We are offering a full spectrum of services to the customers, not just remittances,"" Hose said.  Beating the branch  Hose sees services like the Teller app becoming increasingly important given that it continues to be costly for traditional banks to service the developing world.  The argument has gained increasing merit in the industry given that, while many banks and financial institutions seem more eager to leverage decentralized ledgers, bitcoin the currency perhaps remains a compelling use case for reaching customers outside this established system.  ""It’s impossible to serve [the unbanked] with branches,"" he continued. ""The costs are too high, even in cities. Think about someone who is earning $200 a month, and has an average balance of $100. The bank will make $3 a year on them, if lucky. The minute that customer walks into a regular branch, the bank is already losing money.""  To safeguard customers, Coins.ph suggests it will screen app users before allowing them to engage in activities via the app, though it did not provide additional details as to any specifc criteria they would need to meet.  As with Abra, Teller will employ an Uber-like rating system it believes will reduce the risk of customer dissatisfaction in using the app.  Thailand image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/07/20/coinsph-launches-peer-to-peer-bitcoin-app-for-southeast-asia,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f96013a8024e8fab0501dddb5fd09a6fec5d359-2560x1490.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398510,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbURzv,1437392195,Redpoint VC: Bitcoin is Fastest-Growing Area of Funding,"Bitcoin is the fastest growing area of startup investment since mid-2012, a venture capitalist at Redpoint has claimed.  In his recent analysis of Mattermark data, Tomasz Tunguz noted that investment in bitcoin companies – closely followed by photo sharing and physical storage startups – has grown by 151% in the last three years.  However, Tunguz pointed out that bitcoin startups represent a ""minuscule fraction"" of the total invested funds – receiving just 0.18% of the total funding in the last year.  VC investment in the banking industry has only grown by 65% since mid-2012, but the sector received a 1.85% share of the total number of dollars invested in the last twelve months.  Redpoint  , which has funded 434 companies to date, offers seed, early and growth stage investment to startups.

42398512,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbUS2s,1437384630,BitFury Investor: Leave the Blockchain to Me,"Gleb Davidyuk has one simple piece of advice for fellow investors who are looking to back blockchain projects: don't.  In an interview with CoinDesk, the founder of iTech Capital – one of three firms behind BitFury's latest $20m round – revealed his company is eager to get in early with the fast-moving technology, even if it means spreading a little mischief.  ""There are not that many things left in the Internet environment which you can call truly disruptive,"" he said, adding with a grin: ""Please don't invest in the blockchain, because if you don't I will have more opportunities to do so.""  BitFury's raise – its third in two years – was the first investment of its kind for iTech. When the news was announced last month, a number of headlines hailed the move as Russia's first foray into bitcoin.  However, Davidyuk said this thought hadn't really crossed his team's mind during the deal. ""To be honest, we never thought of that because we are not truly Russian in the full [sense]. We are completely international.""  While the four-year-old VC firm has roots in Russia, he added, it now has offices spread across Europe and Asia. Both its investors and the companies in its portfolio – which span the 'digital economy' – are global too.  Global force  ITech's global strategy, seeking to reduce single points of failure, holds similarities with the bitcoin network – which spreads trust among different parties and locations around the world.  Like the Internet or Skype, Davidyuk said, bitcoin's blockchain is a technology that delivers an ultimatum: get behind it, or get left behind.  Proof of this came earlier this week when Russian president Vladimir Putin made his first comments on digital currencies. While not exactly glowing, they nevertheless demonstrated the significant change in sentiment in the country since its initial hostile statements on the topic.  As with investors, governments also have a choice to be early adopters of bitcoin, Davidyuk said, explaining:  ""[Putin's remarks are] confirming my thesis that you cannot really be against something which becomes global, so if the sky is blue, then the sky is blue. Therefore, it's not enough to be aggressive against it.""  Currently, the best place for bitcoin companies to get funding is Silicon Valley. 49% of funding to date has taken place there and while 23 countries now have a VC-backed startup, the amount of funding in the US ($569.1m) is nearly triple that of the rest of the world.  According to Davidyuk, this may soon change. ""Today's world is not concentrated in Silicon Valley,"" he said, adding:  ""The Internet as a sector has the lowest barriers to entry. We started a few years ago in Russia now we are completely global ... even given the fact that the geopolitical situation is difficult for us to explore opportunities.""  Though their location and communication channels might be great, this could well work against them, he said.  Fast and significant  The company is already looking to back BitFury's next ""fast and significant"" round, which, according to Davidyuk, is already in the works.  Why the rush? Well, the more money you have the more opportunities you get, he said. The company needs as many resources it can get to keep its spot as the best-capitalised mining firm in bitcoin or, in Davidyuk's words, its ""unique position to conquer the world"".  He described how iTech is also hoping prove its value to the startup by bringing bigger investors, including an investment bank, to its next deal.  ""We are actually very much involved in creating an infrastructure and covering a lot of stakeholders within the financial industry, and I think we'll be able to bring much more capital needed and bring more brains, money and power into the business.""  Will this list include other Russian players? ""Not necessarily,"" he said, adding: ""I think we play in a global game now so there is no direct link to Russia at all, it's a purely international play.""  iTech is also fielding pitches from other startups and Davidyuk said the company is open to future opportunities in the sector.  So far its investments – which typically range from $1m to $10m – have spanned ad tech, online travel, big data and FinTech. However, when thinking about the impact bitcoin could have, Davidyuk said, it doesn't seem too far from these areas.  ""The more we known about the blockchain, the more interesting it becomes. Everything which we have to pay for the banks or different third party providers in the financial world now becomes available for free.""",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/07/20/bitfury-investor-leave-the-blockchain-to-me,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90536f134bd8b5189951dfaffc9407345270acd0-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
