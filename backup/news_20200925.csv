42384781,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlNOZ,1601071233,"Degens for Hire: Based.Money Is Launching Moonbase, a Place for DeFi Projects to Find Community","BASED has a new method for aligning decentralized finance (DeFi) projects with each other. At its core is a smart contract called Moonbase, CoinDesk has learned.      Based.Money is a project of the Ghouls, a loose consortium of crypto developers, artists, designers and meme makers. Friday night, the outfit will release its newest project since BASED, the rebasing game dropped this summer during the boom of Weird DeFi.      Based.Money is a game that riffs on Ampleforth's rebasing mechanic, where it makes a daily readjustment in the supply of BASED tokens, adjusting the amount in everyone's wallet. It's a game of optimizing for the right time to get in and get out.      But Moonbase is a bit more serious. As the project's pseudonymous proximal leader, Based Money God, told CoinDesk over Jitsi:    ""What we're all about is creating a fair launch movement. An ecosystem of projects that are self-sustaining and don't require traditional venture capital or institutional investment in order to succeed. We want to create a collaborative space of builders in which we all benefit.    Read more: How DeFi 'Degens' Are Gaming Ethereum's Money Legos      Fair launches are a way to get lots of people involved in a new DeFi project without relying on traditional seed capital. Yearn.Finance is often credited for popularizing the term after announcing a governance token and a way for liquidity providers (LPs) to earn them without setting tokens aside for anyone else, even the creator.      ""Most of these DeFi projects aren't inherently decentralized. They are inherently skewed or biased because VCs back them,"" Based Money God said. ""When these projects raise, the VC allocations have a disproportionate amount of tokens.""    A new alliance    Moonbase creates a way that new projects can offer tribute to the BASED community such that they have an incentive to back, promote and support the new project for at least a year. It could almost be called community mining.      ""You can see the power of our community because our memes are dope and our messaging is cool,"" Based Money God said. ""Moonbase, the intent, socially, is trying to help these projects and bootstrap community and aligning themselves to Based.""      It might also be thought of hiring the Based community, in a way. Some crypto projects hire PR firms; some will hire the memesters of the Moonbase.      Read more: Yearn, YAM and the Rise of Crypto's 'Weird DeFi' Moment      So how does it work?      DeFi projects that want to get degenerate will mint a new smart contract called a Rover. Each Rover will be distinct for each project. The core idea of a Rover is that any assets that go in it will go through a yearlong unlocking period (so if 365 DAI went in, the last DAI would unlock at the end of a year).      As the underlying assets get unlocked, they will get swapped for BASED and be sent to the Moonbase, rewarding everyone participating there proportionally.      Basically, Moonbase is another smart contract where anyone can put in BASED and get back mbBASED, which represents a proportional share of BASED in the contract (like Compound's cTokens).      That means mbBASED holders will want any assets in Rovers to grow in value. However, the alignment is meant to go further.      A project can put anything they want in a Rover with any logic they want. They could throw 1,000 ETH into a Rover and send the Moonbase a message that just said ""Please help,"" but that's not actually how the Ghouls foresee it working.      Instead, they expect projects will create special liquidity vaults for mbBASED that will have their own formulas for earning liquidity mining rewards, and earnings for that pool wouldn't go to the depositor but to the Rover.      Read more: Uniswap's Distribution Is Built on Something That Can't Be Forked: Actual Users      So, imagine a decentralized exchange called RDEX that launched this way. It could set up an mbBASED-DAI pool where half the mining rewards (RBT, say?) go to the depositor (for the DAI) and half the rewards go to REDEX Rover.      ""It's like a tribute to Based God,"" Based Money God said.      By setting it up this way, the project has an incentive to try to really grab the attention of Moonbase depositors, because no rewards go to the Rover if no one deposits. This is why they are called Rovers.      ""The Rover is bringing things back to the moonbase,"" Based Money God said.      The Moonbase has an incentive to drive value to RBT, because eventually that RBT will turn into more BASED for the Moonbase.      Finally, anyone can set up a Rover. It's permissionless. But obviously, there's a need to get the attention of the Moonbase.      So, there will be a page on Snapshot where projects can submit what they are doing and the community will vote on one question or another: ""Is it BASED?""      The vote has no impact on the smart contract. On a technical level, it does nothing, but it might be the most important step.      Said Based Money God:    ""If you want that social validation, if you want to really take advantage of the social advantages of our community, you need to present to our community. There needs to be a ceremony.""    Watch the Twitter account because Moonbase opens tonight. Actual DeFi projects will launch Rovers over the weekend and the smart contract that makes it easy for others to do the same will follow.      ""We are writing out a manifesto,"" Based Money God said. ""BASED is whatever the community decides is based.""",POSITIVE,ETH | DAI,ETH | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING | DAI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/25/degens-for-hire-basedmoney-is-launching-moonbase-a-place-for-defi-projects-to-find-community,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c6df0ad7c1f89cf1ae06c9cb636a74537814c99-1500x1001.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384791,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlNXN,1601070209,Nevada Woman Charged in Bitcoin Murder-for-Hire as a Mystery Hacker Again Turns Tipster,"A Nevada woman is facing federal charges for allegedly paying a darkweb hitman $5,000 worth of bitcoin to murder her ex-husband in a case that shares striking parallels with another recent murder-for-hire plot.    The hit, ordered in spring 2016, did not go through. But 36-year-old Kristy Lynn Felkins was indicted in California federal court Thursday for allegedly paying a phony hitman 12 BTC (at the time worth $5,000) to see that it did.  Homeland Security agents traced the murder-for-hire bitcoin to a LocalBitcoins account associated with Felkins, who, through a pseudonym, had allegedly discussed mixing her bitcoin with the scammer prior to allegedly paying him, authorities said.  Chat logs cited in a criminal complaint detail a month-long back-and-forth in which the scammer tries and fails to up-sell the Felkins-linked pseudonym on a more expensive method of killing before ultimately ghosting her, the murder uncommitted.  Federal agents said their tip came from an unnamed foreign hacker who ""scraped"" the murder-for-hire site for information, chat logs and bitcoin addresses and then handed it to the Feds ""in or about January 2019.""  The Felkins hacker-tipster generally matches the description and circumstances of another hacker-tipster federal agents cited in a separate but similar darkweb murder-for-hire investigation CoinDesk covered last month.  In that case, agents said their source was providing information in multiple ongoing investigations but declined to provide his name or the site he had scraped.  The hacker-tipster is additionally described in this case's filings as a foreigner convicted outside the U.S. of possessing child pornography. His information has proven ""to be reliable,"" agents wrote.  He is working with the U.S. government without any expectation of monetary gain or get-out-of-jail-free cards, according to the Felkins complaint.  A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for confirmation that the two hacker-tipster sources are the same.    The charges demonstrate how individuals who view bitcoin as a gateway to criminal dealings – thinking, perhaps, that the crypto provides unparalleled economic anonymity in a digital-first world – can readily wind up in the feds' crosshairs when bitcoin's immutable and highly traceable ledger gives their transactions away.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | WALLET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/09/25/nevada-woman-charged-in-bitcoin-murder-for-hire-as-a-mystery-hacker-again-turns-tipster,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29de9e48d42ccbd5cc2360a439ae57a29d96e37f-1550x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Meanwhile, DeFi investors continue to seek places to park crypto for steady yield.    Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $10,730 as of 20:30 UTC (4:30 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.50% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $10,550-$10,795  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price was able to cling to $10,700 territory, rebounding from a bit of a dip after the cryptocurrency rallied on Thursday. It was changing hands around $10,730 as of press time Friday      Read more: Up 5%: Bitcoin Sees Biggest Single-Day Price Gain for 2 Months      Guy Hirsch, managing director and U.S. head for multi-asset broker eToro, points to fundamentals for a bullish bitcoin case.      He cites bitcoin’s mining hashrate and difficulty hitting all-time highs, along with heightened economic uncertainty in the face of rising COVID-19. “$11,000 is the only barrier to a parabolic run towards $12,000 or higher,” Hirsch told CoinDesk.      Neil Van Huis, head of institutional trading at liquidity provider Blockfills, said he is just happy bitcoin has been able to stay over $10,000, which he contends feels is a key price point.      “I think we’ve seen that test of $10,000 hold which keeps me a level-headed bull,” he said.      The last time bitcoin dipped below $10,000 was Sept. 9.      “Below $10,000 makes me worried about a pullback to $9,000,” Van Huis added.      The weekend should be relatively calm for crypto, according to Jason Lau, chief operating officer for cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin.      He pointed to open interest in the futures market as the source of that assessment. ""BTC aggregate open interest is still flat despite bitcoin’s overnight price gain – nobody is opening new positions at this price level,” Lau noted.      Another indicator of expected calm is bitcoin swaps funding, which remains in negative or near zero territory – a signal derivatives traders are still hesitant to place bullish bets.      Lau said there would need to be positive funding rates in the derivatives market before another big price pop.      “Until funding goes positive again, it’s hard to see us going much higher – for me that's the best indicator of where we are at the moment,” said Lau. “Longs are being paid to open positions, so it confirms that there's still a lot of hesitation at current price levels.""    Investors hunting for yield plow into dForce    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Thursday, trading around $355 and climbing 2.7% in 24 hours as of 20:30 UTC (4:30 p.m. ET).

Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner of Tellurian Capital, which invests in the DeFi ecosystem, says some investors should be wary of trendy projects cropping up in the ecosystem.      “There’s a great pace of innovation, but in some cases, project releases are not even a minimum viable product,” he said. “So the chances for breaking are pretty high which implies a huge risk premium and high volatility for the tokens as we have seen over the last few weeks.”      It’s possible, then, that crypto traders like dForce for parking assets while waiting for more exciting opportunities.

Plaid <3 DeFi Visa-owned fintech company Plaid, which connects traditional bank accounts to thousands of digital platforms has quietly added support for Dharma’s DeFi wallet and Teller Finance, a DeFi startup bringing unsecured lending to the Ethereum blockchain. CoinDesk’s Ian Allison got the scoop that Plaid’s head of UK, Keith Grose, is a believer in decentralized and open applications, even if it’s a cynical attempt for fintech to manage its own disruption. “I think it’s still a long way before DeFi becomes part of the main route for finance, but it’s a really exciting corner and one that personally I’m passionate about,” Grose told Allison. “We’re only scratching the surface…”      Tax policies The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is reportedly repositioning a question about crypto transactions that will make it harder for taxpayers to avoid declaring their holdings. According to a Wall Street Journal report Friday, the IRS is updating the 1040 income tax form for 2020 to require that all returnees check a box if they have transacted any crypto assets over the year – placing the question at the top of the document, rather than buried further down, the WSJ says. A law expert told the WSJ that the question would make it easier for the IRS to win cases if the taxpayer checks the ""no"" box and is later found to have held crypto. Half a world away, four Knesset members are seeking to ease Israel’s 25% capital gains tax on cryptocurrencies through draft legislation.      Bipartisan appeal A new bipartisan-backed bill aims to clarify investment contract assets or digital tokens sold as part of a securities offering are separate and distinct commodities, not securities, CoinDesk’s Sandali Handagama reports. Introduced by Chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), the legislation would amend existing securities laws to exclude tokens from the definition of a security. Chief Policy Officer for the Chamber of Digital Commerce Amy Davine Kim, said tokens – issued by companies that register with the SEC – are the object of an investment contract and not necessarily a security. Rep. Michael Conaway (R-Texas), who joined Emmer in introducing the legislation, proposed a separate bill Thursday that could bring digital currency exchanges under a single federal framework.      China & crypto Ant Group has launched a cross-border trading blockchain platform, called ""Trusple.""

Ant has partnered with the likes of Standard Chartered, Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas to help ""optimize"" the process. Ant, a sister to Alibaba Group, is looking to raise a record $35 billion in a dual public listing. Meanwhile, Chinese state media have broadcasted a coordinated campaign declaring that ""cryptocurrency has undoubtedly become the top performing investment"" this year. CoinDesk’s Wolfie Zhou said while many are responding to the bullish signal others are concerned about the potential agenda behind the rare coordinated effort.      a16z approval Andreessen Horowitz’s (a16z) late-stage venture fund has received a green light from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for a transaction involving Coinbase. The VC giant’s $2 billion fund, Andreessen Horowitz LSV Fund I, L.P, received antitrust clearance from the FTC in a filing dated Sept. 22 involving “Coinbase Global, Inc,” Coinbase’s parent. CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson and Zack Steward report it is unclear whether the approval is for the fund’s previously disclosed purchase of shares in the cryptocurrency exchange or for a new purchase. Though, given Coinbase’s $8 billion valuation would represent nearly half of a16z’s $16.6 billion assets under management, it’s extremely unlikely the clearance is for an outright purchase.

Earlier this week stablecoin issuers received a reassuring message from some of the top U.S. financial regulators: parking your fiat reserves in banks is A-OK.      On Monday, the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), under the U.S. Department of the Treasury, issued official guidance declaring that national banks and federal savings associations can hold reserve funds for stablecoin issuers. It was a signal for these issuers to continue what they already have been doing for years.      Indeed, the dollar-backed stablecoin market nearly quadrupled in size over the past year – from around $5 billion in September 2019 to around $20 billion currently – with much of that wealth backed by reserves held in bank accounts. Much of this growth has been driven by international demand for dollars as well as the increasingly sophisticated financial tools being built on top of public blockchain technology. Since its inception, however, the stablecoin market has existed amid regulatory ambiguity.      The new ruling, the first federal guidance issued regarding stablecoins, adds legitimacy to the booming market sector and paves the way for more banks to enter the ecosystem, say industry commentators. Still, it’s unclear whether the mandate will have any short-term significance.      “If you don’t have guidance from the banking regulator about how banks can participate in those schemes – or arrangements, rather – that would limit growth. It paves the way for growth,” Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle said over Zoom. “But it doesn’t change the way Circle operates today.”      Allaire isn’t alone in his thinking. “The letter indicates a positive sentiment coming from a top government agency,” Kristen Smith, founder of the Blockchain Association, a D.C. crypto advocacy group, said. “Will it have any major practical changes for the way fiat-backed stablecoins operate? Probably not.”    Market intel    $20B milestone The total value of stablecoins has now surpassed $20 billion, reflecting the growing demand of investors looking to hedge their risks in both crypto and traditional markets amid the coronavirus pandemic. Data from Coin Metrics show that the total value of assets for all stablecoins breached the $20 billion mark Thursday, only a little more than four months after the number broke a $10-billion record in May. Stablecoins are digital tokens, the values of which are pegged to fiat currencies like U.S. dollars.      Mint wrappers Three Arrows Capital completed the largest single issuance of new wrapped bitcoin tokens by any merchant, minting 2,316 WBTC through BitGo Thursday afternoon. The Singapore-based firm’s mint represents nearly 3% of the current wrapped bitcoin supply, just over 81,000 at last check. One week ago, Alameda Research set the previous record for most tokens issued in a single mint with 1,999 WBTC issued. Since January, the total supply of wrapped bitcoin has grown by over 13,000% from less than 600 WBTC, according to data from Dune Analytics, CoinDesk’s Zack Voell reports.    Tech pod    Private browsing Privacy tech company Aleo has launched a data privacy-oriented blockchain and developer kit to make writing zero-knowledge proofs in web applications easy and scalable. CoinDesk’s Ben Powers reports the startup is releasing its first round of software tools to let developers write private applications for the web using a new programming language called Leo, as well as integrate these tools into pre-existing browsers’ functions. Aleo leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), a cryptographic technique that allows two parties on the internet, such as an app and a user, to verify information with each other without sharing the underlying data related to this information.    Internet 2030    Jonathan Beller is Professor of Media Studies at Pratt Institute and member of the Economic Space Agency (ECSA) think-tank. His forthcoming book The World Computer: Derivative Conditions of Racial Capitalism will be published by Duke UP in 2021. This essay is part of the Internet 2030 series exploring the future of the digital economy. The essay excerpted below is part of CoinDesk’s ongoing Internet 2030 series exploring the future of digital technologies and cultures.      Tokenization revolution Now, in 2030, there is a global movement to redesign the convergence of communications and monetary media as post-capitalist economic media.      The internet of the past has been clearly grasped as an extension of capitalism that turned everyone to workers in the social factory, who are paid in company scrip, while the real value was hoarded by shareholders. The “background monetization” of our words, images, locations, faces and metabolic processes was recognized as a key impediment to general emancipation and as a blockade against solving world historical problems including climate change.      Indeed, some claimed (rightly from our perspective), that the economic logic of the internet in 2020 also prevented the possibility of adequately addressing the egregious forms of profitable oppression that come under various headings including “racism” and “sexism,” endemic to what was essentially racial capitalism.      No longer, it had been decided by a growing number of Earthlings by 2030, will companies and governments strip us of our expressive power, our powers to create cultures, worlds and value(s). No longer will they devalue our lives in accord with their agendas.      We will no longer alienate our “content” as property for someone else’s platform, we will no longer provide labor for someone else’s capital, we will no longer be a pawn in centralized sovereign governance that couldn’t care less about us. We refuse the psychopathology and megalomania that comes from having to assert ourselves by actively denying the real conditions of existence, conditions that inexorably convert our expression into murder.      In short, as one manifesto put it, “We will no longer serve as batteries for someone else’s matrix.”      CoinDesk’s “Internet 2030” series examines the future of the medium and what role blockchain and crypto will play in it with content and conversations on the future of the decentralized web.

42384789,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlNYd,1601050945,Voyager CEO Says Revenue Growth Accelerates 8-Fold as DeFi Trading Surges,"The super-charged trajectory of the cryptocurrency industry is translating to faster growth at the publicly traded digital-asset brokerage Voyager Digital, where revenue this quarter is tracking at an eightfold increase over the prior 12 months’ average pace.      Voyager CEO Steve Ehrlich told CoinDesk in a Zoom interview that the company’s on pace for revenue of about $2 million during the fiscal first quarter that ends Sept. 30. That compares with $1.1 million during the fiscal year that ended in June.      The company’s shares, listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange, have rallied about 250% year, far surpassing the 49% year-to-date gains for the largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC), and 169% for No. 2 ether (ETH).      Ehrlich said in the interview that he’s perfectly happy having investors buy Voyager’s shares as a play on the cryptocurrency industry’s growth. Stockholders, he said, don’t have to delve into the nuances of individual tokens, given the industry’s notorious history of extreme price volatility.      “You're getting access to the digital crypto markets but you’re getting it through a publicly traded company that is trading on behalf of their customers,” Ehrlich said.      Ehrlich said some of Voyager’s growth in the quarter has come from investors seeking quick gains from the fast-moving arena of decentralized finance, or DeFi, where programmers are using blockchain technology to build automated networks for lending and trading. It’s a business that aspires to challenge traditional Wall Street firms with a cheaper and potentially more equitable model.      But he acknowledged that the DeFi tokens can be complicated and require “education” efforts. The tokens often represent little-tested projects in hardly-established markets. Prices for Kyber Network’s KNC token, traded on Voyager, have plunged 41% in the past month, though they’re still roughly five times where they started the year.      “We saw people kind of reallocate a little bit out of the DeFi and a couple other tokens” amid a sell-off in the sector this week, he said.      Ehrlich said Voyager has no plans to put any of the company’s corporate treasury into cryptocurrencies. Such a move was announced recently by publicly traded Microstrategy, which said it steered at least $425 million into bitcoin.      “Our investors want us to be that agency broker,” Ehrlich said. “They want us to be the one that executes the trade in microseconds for customers, not making bets on coins one way or another.”      He added that he has encouraged some corporate executives wary of following Microstrategy’s bitcoin play to consider converting their cash into USD Coin’s dollar-linked USDC stablecoins, which can be deposited at Voyager for a 9.5% interest rate.",POSITIVE,BTC | KNC,BTC | BUSINESS | KNC | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/25/voyager-ceo-says-revenue-growth-accelerates-8-fold-as-defi-trading-surges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eb20ba0ec8ab9f7fe0f295ad69e57b55df989783-1420x766.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384776,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlNIH,1601049735,"This Entrepreneur Was SIM-Swapped so Often, He Started a Company to Fight It","The first time he was SIM-swapped in 2018, Haseeb Awan took it on the chin and hoped it wouldn’t happen again. Then came the second incident. Then the third. Then the fourth. After the last swap, Awan stopped trusting his mobile provider to keep his account safe and took matters into his own hands: He started his own cell service company.      It was a major pivot from his former day job running the BitAccess Bitcoin ATM network, a company he co-founded and which, incidentally, made him a prime target for SIM-swapping.      His new venture, Efani, is dedicated to stopping a problem that is all-too-prevalent for cryptocurrency users – a problem which most mobile carriers, as evidenced by Awan’s own problems, have failed to adequately address.    What is SIM swapping?    SIM-swapping is a socially engineered hack wherein an attacker ports a victim’s phone number onto a SIM card they control. To hijack a mobile account, an attacker may impersonate a victim to convince a customer service representative to swap the number to the new SIM card. In more elaborate cases, a SIM swap may occur as an inside job or by way of bribing a customer service rep.      These socially engineered attacks have become an all-too-common problem in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency realm, particularly for its higher-profile personalities. Typically, SIM swappers will target cryptocurrency users with the hope of accessing their exchange accounts through text-message, two-factor authentication.      Perhaps the most famous example of this attack vector comes from Michael Terpin, who lost some $24 million from a SIM swap, prompting a $220 lawsuit against AT&T. Plenty of other cryptocurrency users have fallen prey to such attacks and subsequently had their exchange accounts drained of funds. The 2020 Twitter hacker was even part of a syndicate that orchestrated SIM swaps.      Read more: Judge Dismisses $200M Damages Claim in AT&T Crypto Hack Lawsuit    Efani: A cybersecurity firm that provides telecom services    Awan is on the long roster of crypto SIM-swap victims, which is why he founded Efani in 2019.      The company operates a bit like a mobile virtual network operator. It uses the network infrastructure of Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile to service its customers. But it only relies on this infrastructure to provide cell coverage. Everything else for the $99/month plan, from data management to customer service, is managed in house according to Efani’s own practices.      “Our focus is cyber security. Other companies are telecom providers which have other companies provide security for them. We are a cybersecurity firm that provides telecom services.”      According to Awan, most mobile providers only require a phone and account number to make changes to an existing plan. They also give users the option to set a PIN, but even this layer of protection can be bypassed if the hacker is savvy enough. More difficult to control still are bribes and inside jobs.    11 layers of defense    Efani’s solution to this problem? Making it so damn difficult to make changes to an account that an attack is virtually impossible.      “You cannot make a change for your account by calling customer service,” Awan told CoinDesk. “Even if you call in, they are not authorized to make any changes. For something like changing a SIM card, you may have to go through 11 layers of authentication.”      Those 11 layers of authentication are the maximum number of verification methods available to Efani users, while every account has a minimum of seven authentication steps when a user wants to replace their SIM card. These verifications involve providing the last four digits of the credit card on file, phone number, SIM card number, and other information.      “We have made it so rigorous that it eliminates any chance of SIM swapping. Most people give up after the second or third authentication step,” Awan said.      Read more: Social Engineering: A Plague on Crypto and Twitter, Unlikely to Stop      Perhaps the most important feature – and the last step for authorizing a change to an account – involves notarizing a letter of intent. Each user must visit a notary public to authorize a change to their service, and this notary is verified by Efani’s legal team.      Even after this final step, a seven-day “cool-off” period goes into effect before the new SIM card can be activated. And it can’t be any old SIM card bought at your local convenience store, either; Efani sends each account holder two encrypted SIM cards when they sign up with the service, and only the backup is authorized to carry the user’s number if the old card is lost.    Old tricks, new dogs    On top of these measures, Efani conducts background checks of all employees, requires multi-employee authorization to make account changes and stores customer information in server silos to keep data segregated. Additionally, customer names and phone numbers are kept separate.      Efani’s plans are also insured up to $5 million by Lloyd’s of London for any theft or data breach that may occur through Efani’s services.      Awan, who bootstrapped the company with his own finances, said that it’s profitable and on track to hit seven figures in revenue this year. About a third of its clients are cryptocurrency users, he said, adding that the rest are typically high-profile individuals, including professional athletes for the L.A. Lakers and San Francisco Giants, other celebrities and a fair number of lawyers.      When asked what can be done to “fix” the current state of SIM swapping (without starting a competing business), Awan was pessimistic about the capacity for change in legacy providers. Most customer service employees, who are contractors to begin with, “are not sophisticated enough to understand the threat level.”      Moreover, changing something that affects so few customers anyway is probably not on their radar, especially considering it would require a complete overhaul of their processes.      “I don’t think this problem will be solved by any carrier. Changing the current system would require updating the system and processes for every mobile account in America and this is not easy to do,” Awan said.      “The second problem is that the carriers want to believe this is not an issue. It affects probably 1% of the population. It’d be like saying, “Ok, every car sold in the U.S. comes with bulletproof glass.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/25/this-entrepreneur-was-sim-swapped-so-often-he-started-a-company-to-fight-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70221faeb13c48728c4ff578ea29cb3e0377fb73-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced on Friday, the solution to counter scam-ads uses video performance data from Theta’s network to assign a “reputation score” for each streamer based on their viewership. Generated using Google’s big data solution, BigQuery, the score is then broadcast onto the Ethereum network using Chainlink’s oracles where advertisers can examine it while deciding to whom to give ads.    In a press statement emailed to CoinDesk, Theta said using this solution could help advertisers better identify which streams receive more unique human visitors and help filter out fake viewership data generated through the usage of click-farms and bots.   Theta’s video sharing network is built on a model which rewards network participants for transmitting content to other users by using their spare bandwidth and computing resources. Earlier in May, Google announced it had signed-on as a network validator for Theta.   According to the emailed statement, the data transmitted by Chainlink onto the Ethereum blockchain can also be used to automate contractual agreements between advertisers and content providers using smart contracts.

The SEC slapped SoluTech and its co-founder, 24-year-old Nathan Pitruzzello with fines and a cease-and-desist order for conducting its unregistered 2018-2019 ICO of the SCRL token in an administrative filing published Friday.    The order described how SCRL would ""eventually be usable"" with SoluTech's ""blockchain data management solution"" mainnet called Scroll Network (SoluTech folded in October 2019.).  But SCRL was an unregistered security, the regulator ruled, as SCRL's 100 investors had a ""reasonable expectation"" of profiting from the SoluTech's efforts – a critical prong of the Howey Test.  Additionally, Pitruzzello ""recklessly misrepresented"" his fintech's history of revenue generation and existing client base to boost investments in his ICO, the order said. The SEC determined SCRL's sale therefore constituted a fraud.  Under the terms of the settlement, Pitruzzello promised the SEC to never again host a digital asset security offering, though he will be allowed to buy and sell on his own behalf.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value was trading at $345 on Friday at 15:20 UTC. This represents a 20% decline on a month-to-date basis. Prices reached two-year highs above $480 on Sept. 1.  While the cryptocurrency has suffered a double-digit price pullback, the number of ether held by top non-exchange addresses has increased by 8% to 27.79 million from 25.54 million, as per data provided by the blockchain intelligence firm Santiment.  The total amount of ether held by non-exchange addresses has increased by 20% since mid-July.  ""Accumulation during the price drop shows investor confidence in the cryptocurrency's long-term prospects is strengthening,"" Nicholas Pelecanos, head of trading at NEM Ventures, an investment arm of the NEM blockchain ecosystem, told CoinDesk in a LinkedIn chat.  Pelecanos expects the trend to continue as the decentralized finance (DeFi) boom shows no signs of slowing down.  The total value locked in the DeFi applications rose above $9 billion earlier this month, an increase of more than 1,400% year-to-date, according to data source DeBank.  Ethereum's blockchain dominates the DeFi space, and big investors often self-custody ether on decentralized lending/borrowing platforms to generate additional returns rather than just hold.

42432752,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1ETh,1601048788,Money Reimagined: Memes Mean Money,"Before we get into this week’s column, an announcement, one I’m super excited about.      Today, we’re simultaneously launching a new podcast under the same name as this newsletter: CoinDesk’s Money Reimagined. Like the newsletter, it’s a conversation around the technological, political and social forces reshaping our financial system. For each show, I’ll be joined by the tremendous Sheila Warren, blockchain lead at the World Economic Forum, as we sit down with insightful guests from around the world.      Below you’ll find links to the first show, which you can use to subscribe with your preferred podcast player. In it, we dive more deeply into the “culture of money” theme addressed in this week’s newsletter, including a four-way interview with multimedia artist Nicky Enright and University of Virginia Media Studies Professor Lana Swartz.      For free, early access to new episodes of Money Reimagined subscribe to CoinDesk Reports with Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, CastBox or direct RSS for your favorite podcast player.    Those silly DeFi memes, they’re really important    Sushi, Hotdogs, Yams, Shrimp.      The whimsical, food-obsessed names of of the latest decentralized finance (DeFi) outfits are antithetical to the stodgy imagery of the mainstream financial system they seek to disrupt. Banks’ memes, by contrast, skew toward strength and durability. (Think of the lion statues and Roman columns guarding bank branches in old parts of London, New York or Paris.)      DeFi’s critics say the silly names show it’s merely a fad, a game – or worse – a scam. It’s all imaginary, they say. It’s not real.      The problem with that perspective is that all aspects of money, including the financial systems built on top of it, are imaginary.      And, in case you’re wondering, that’s a feature, not a bug.      Israeli historian Yuval Harari calls money “the most successful story ever told,” even more important to the evolution of society than religion, corporations and a host of other human-imagined institutions. Like those concepts, money’s power hinges on the collective adoption of a common belief system. It takes a set of mutually understood rules and gives them symbolic representation in a token we call a currency. In exchanging that token, we reach agreements that reflect those rules and so enable commerce, collaboration, value creation and, ultimately, civilization.      Storytelling and cultural creation have always been integral to how society fosters this belief system, how we’ve forged communities around currencies. It’s why representations of money and the conversations around it are rich with iconography, foundational myths and stirring language.      This process of collective imagination has become firmly tied to another powerful imaginary concept: the nation-state. This combination has been so effective that it has survived the introduction of new technologies and tokens over time. We’ve gone from shells to coins to banknotes to checks to credit cards to Venmo, and each time we’ve just accepted that a new transfer vehicle can convey the same rules and values we’ve always attached to our national currencies.      This is a useful lens to apply to the many new ideas for money bubbling up in the crypto world. Whether it’s bitcoin’s bid to become a digital gold-like currency or the fight between Uniswap and SushiSwap to dominate liquidity in DeFi’s lending markets, the semiotic process for creating memes and stories is vital to the establishment of a new system. We need to reimagine money.    Imagined communities    If you have a $100 bill in your wallet, take a good look at it.      On one side, there’s Ben Franklin’s balding head and his shoulders, behind which are a quill, an inkwell with the Liberty Bell superimposed onto it and an extract from the Declaration of Independence. There are also the seals of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve, the signatures of the Secretary of the Treasury and the Treasurer, a serial number and other identifying numerals.      On the other, we see Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where Franklin and other Founding Fathers signed the declaration, along with the words “In God We Trust.” On both sides, the number 100 appears numerous times in and around a highly ornate border.      Combined with cotton threads and watermarks, the baroque design helps make the note difficult to counterfeit. But more important, the imagery appeals directly to patriotism. It’s all associated with the nation-state to which the dollar, we are encouraged to believe, is indelibly linked.      Now think about the actual value of the note, by which I mean the physical piece of paper. You could use it as a bookmark, maybe, make a paper plane out of it, or write a very small amount of information in very small print on it. But none of those uses add up to $100 in utility.      A banknote’s value comes almost entirely from our shared imagination, a commonality of beliefs fed by centuries of cultural production that forges a type of community. It’s only because the payer and the payee share those beliefs that this piece of paper can function as an instrument for clearing that community’s debts.      Each tribe of cryptocurrency advocates is endeavoring to create the same sense of community and belief around its preferred token. How they attain that is a cultural challenge.    What’s real?    In November 2014, I created a video for The Wall Street Journal with Nicky Enright, a multimedia artist. We filmed him walking the streets of the Diamond District in New York’s Midtown as he wore an A-frame sandwich board and held a wad of “Globos,” his personal currency, in hand. The beautifully ornate notes were on sale for a $1, he told passersby, in a special two-for-one deal.      The interactions with people were fascinating. One of the most common questions was, “Is it real?” Enright’s answer was always something like, “Of course it’s real. You can see and hold it, right?” As a guest on this week’s inaugural Money Reimagined podcast, Enright reflected on those exchanges, noting that “people will question the Globo in a way that they rarely, if ever, question their own currency” and yet the very same questions about what is “real” could be applied to the purely symbolic value of the dollar.      The pertinent question for cryptocurrency advocates is: How do the purveyors and believers in a particular currency similarly get enough people to believe in it, to view it as “real?” And that’s again where the cultural conversation comes in.      It’s why Bitcoin’s culture is filled with ideas, phrases and iconography that help build community. Think of the word “HODL,” or the concept that Bitcoin is “The Honey Badger of Money,” or the almost religious devotion to the mysterious founding father, Satoshi. (By the way, it’s irrelevant that these ideas, like DeFi’s, seem frivolous to traditionalists. They are appropriately in line with the meme culture of the digital age, and consistent with the liberal conventions that internet culture unleashed, as names like Yahoo and Google became corporate mainstays.)    Meme governance    University of Virginia media studies professor Lana Swartz, author of the newly published ""New Money: How Payment Became Social Media,"" has some thoughts on all this.      As the second guest on this week’s podcast, she reflected on the very early research that she and two colleagues did into Bitcoin’s culture in 2013. At that time, she said, “there was a real fixation on the idea that Bitcoin would be free from human institutions, free from human foibles and free from the need for human governance. … But then all these early Bitcoin people ever really did was to talk and create community, and create ways to govern themselves, and create ways to think about this project.”      It’s a great insight. Money is inseparable from community, and community is about values, the expression of which involves governance. (Not government per se, but governance.)      This brings us full circle to DeFi, where tribes conduct meme warfare on Twitter and elsewhere to promote their tokens. Each of those tokens is tied to a protocol, which offers a different form of governance.      The difference with traditional money is that the enforcement of each token’s particular governance model comes via a decentralized network rather than the centralized institutions of a nation-state.      That shift is what makes it so promising. But it’s also why the cultural creation process is so challenging, as it must compete with the giant mindshare that traditional finance occupies. It’s why the meme-ing must continue.    The end of wall street as we know it?    Hats off to Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal for coming up with a killer graph. (Sadly, I’m using that descriptive literally.) The chart, which appeared Tuesday in Bloomberg’s daily “Five Things to Start your Day” newsletter, maps the reservations at New York restaurants recorded by OpenTable and subway turnstile receipts from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, against the price of shares in SL Green, a real estate investment trust focused on Manhattan office space. COVID-19 has done a number on all three.      I include this here, because when thinking about the future of Manhattan real estate, it’s hard not to think about the future of Wall Street. Banks, brokerages and other financial institutions are giant contributors to the city’s commercial rents, occupying large open-plan trading areas on multiple floors of some of New York City’s prime real estate. But in the COVID-19 era, banks have learned that, with the help of new low-latency connectivity packages, their traders can work pretty well from home, offering the prospect that the firms can save millions in rents if they pare back their footprint in the city.      An exodus from New York by bankers, traders and brokers would mark an end to an era. Hollywood’s movies about testosterone-fueled trading floors will become period pieces. The bigger question is what it means for the idea of Wall Street as a New York institution and, by extension, for the city’s outsized role in the regulation of the global financial system.      There are plenty of reasons for banks to maintain a legal residence in New York. Most important, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) has a unique role within the Fed’s monetary system, as it conducts the open-market operations by which the central bank implements monetary policy. To act as a counterparty with FRBNY in those trades and gain access to that vital flow of monetary liquidity, banks need, at the very least, a capital markets subsidiary domiciled in New York. Their presence for that purpose in turn gives local regulators such as the New York Department of Financial Services a critical role in world finance.      But it’s not hard to imagine that a physical downgrading of banks’ physical presence in New York could, over time, degrade the city’s dominance. Will the rest of the U.S. continue to grant NYC its gatekeeping role? And as central banks, potentially armed with digital currencies, move to expand the range of counter parties they deal with to include non-banks such as large companies and municipalities, New York’s centrality in the process could be further diminished. It’s yet another way in which the seismic events of 2020 could prove a turning point for the world of finance.    The global town hall    CRYPTO-DERIVATIVES BOOM. According to a comprehensive report by CoinDesk Research Hub contributor Blockchain Valley Ventures (BCC), “future contracts volume on cryptocurrencies has surged by close to 300% between H1 2019 and H2 2020,” mostly driven by institutional players using platforms such as Bakkt and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Other interesting takeaways:    Asia accounted for 95% of all futures trading in the second quarter of 2020.  DeFi appears to be increasing the demand crypto derivatives as its smart-contract-based model has the potential to mitigate counter party risks and other dangers of trading in derivatives.  BVV is predicting this boom will inspire mergers and acquisitions in the crypto exchange space as the derivatives market has the potential to grow to 10 times the size of the spot market.    Pro-bitcoin market professionals have long encouraged the development of derivatives markets, as they are supposed to bring two-sided liquidity to the overall market. That, in turn, should reduce volatility, protect investors from excessive losses, build efficiency and contribute to the overall development of crypto as an asset class. But it’s worth contemplating how that process plays out, because it’s not yet translating into immediate payouts to investors in crypto spot markets. Consider, for example, the fact that despite the boom in derivatives, bitcoin’s price can’t seem to get sustainably above $11,000, even as it also tends to find strong support at $10,000 or just below it.      In other words, the idea that market sophistication will translate into a higher bitcoin price isn’t yet playing out.      Despite talk of a bull market and signs of buy-in by mainstream players such as MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor and former Prudential Securities chief George Ball, bitcoin remains well below its 2019 high of $13,789. At this stage of development, the two-sided liquidity of derivatives markets seems to be doing a reasonable job of containing excesses in the spot market. But it will take time for that improved efficiency to breed confidence among institutional and other, more cautious investors, to take actual long-term bets on bitcoin itself.      DEFI’S WHITE-HAT SAVIORS. Some students of the 2008 financial crisis look at the highly complex world of DeFi protocols, tokens and lending markets and see parallels. An opaque, hard-to-understand market in which interrelated credit risks are poorly understood seems ripe for the kind of cascading failures that the similarly complex world of credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations delivered 12 years ago.      They’re right to be concerned, but I think the core risks come in a very different form. Algorithmic, decentralized collateral delivery should, in theory, reduce the kind of counterparty risks markets faced in 2008, when fears that debtors did not have the assets they’d pledged created a downward spiral of selling, fear and self-fulfilling collateral demands. What it doesn’t solve for is software risk. The big danger for DeFi is that bugs in multiple smart contracts will be exploited to steal funds in a synchronized manner, triggering a mass panic from which hackers can profit.      So, it was a bit alarming to read this gripping account by a prolific “white-hat” coder who goes by the handle @SamCzSun about a recent all-nighter he pulled to rescue $9.6 million worth of ether. The funds were sitting in a smart contract associated with Lien Finance, an Ethereum-based protocol for decentralized options and stablecoins, and were vulnerable to a bug that he’d discovered. Being the honest player that he is, he felt compelled to place the funds into a safe environment before someone could dishonestly claim them. The security researcher talks about the challenge he faced in reaching out to someone from the Lien Finance team, since its leadership is all anonymous. Who could he trust? And when he did find someone to help, they faced the challenge of ensuring that their rescue operation wouldn’t tip off others and create a front-running opportunity for them.      The whole thing demonstrates the downside of decentralized finance. The absence of a middleman and the use of decentralized governance might well create special opportunities for financial creativity and access to finance. But, when things go wrong, the under-regulated structure of DeFi makes it extremely difficult for people to appeal to the one thing they often need in a crisis: someone to trust. It also reminded me of the vital role played by white hackers like @SamCzSun, who could have easily grabbed the $9.6 million for himself. Not only do they keep people safe from bad guys, but, in finding flaws, they help developers fix and strengthen the system.      DATA, CLIMATE AND FINANCE. In last week’s column, we discussed how important it is that blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies be calibrated to the challenge of mitigating climate change. But it’s not just this new form of finance that needs alignment with a healthier planet, it’s also old finance, whose investment priorities have for too long skewed in favor of fossil fuel-reliant industries, even though many economists now argue that those investments represent “stranded assets.” As this report from Refinitiv and OMFIF points out, to get financial services to invest more sustainably requires “clear and consistent Environmental, Social and Governance data.” The idea behind ESG is that if reliable data can be provided on environmental performance, more effective mechanisms for rewarding carbon-reducing investments can arise. But right now, both data and the regulations surrounding environmentally sound investments are inconsistent across the globe.      Interestingly, the report makes a clear case for central banks to play a role in setting consistent standards. But what if, as we’ve discussed in a few Money Reimagined newsletters, the whole function of central banks comes into question as technology, economic imperatives and geopolitical tensions move us to a more fragmented, multi-currency world? It’s my view that the world needs data sources that can be trusted across borders, regardless of where they are collected and regardless of the local regulator’s reputation and enforcement capability. It’s where there has to eventually be a place for decentralized systems that can both affirm the reliability of environment-measuring devices and immutably record their data in distributed ledgers that all can access.      Things get really interesting when there’s an intersection between decentralized environmental data and decentralized finance. (See Ian Allison’s piece on Ocean Protocol below.) That’s when carbon markets can be spun up by anyone anywhere so that any innovator with a climate change-fighting project can unlock the capital they need from anywhere else in the world.

42432741,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1E9h,1601047446,Pantera Crypto Funds Report 100% Returns Amid DeFi Craze,"A boom in decentralized finance (DeFi) has turbo-charged returns for Pantera Capital’s bitcoin and mixed cryptocurrency hedge funds this year.      From Jan. 1 to Aug. 31, Pantera’s bitcoin (BTC) fund gained 61%, its digital asset fund 168%, its initial coin offering (ICO) fund 323% and its long-term ICO fund 270%, thanks in large part to Yearn Finance’s YFI, Terra’s LUNA, Polkadot’s DOT, Flexa’s AMP and Ampleforth’s AMPL DeFi-related tokens, according to an investor letter sent out last week. Year-to-date, the funds have outperformed the S&P 500 stock index, as well as index and hedge funds.      The returns also tipped the ICO funds’ life-to-date returns over 0% again and skyrocketed the bitcoin fund’s life-to-date return further from 10,162% to 16,361%. The tilt shows how bitcoin tends to be correlated with alternative cryptocurrencies, called altcoins, and how some investors are bouncing back from the 2018 and 2019 cryptocurrency market downturn with investments in DeFi.      DeFi is a catch-all term for a variety of advanced financial applications for cryptocurrencies, from lending to derivatives to insurance, that have flourished in 2020. Most of the action takes place on Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain, which unlike Bitcoin was designed from the outset to run complex computations enabled by self-executing financial contracts.      “We’ve been positioning the funds towards decentralized finance,” Joey Krug, co-chief investment officer with Dan Morehead, wrote in Pantera’s September 2020 investor letter. “We started acquiring these types of assets some years back, and it’s exciting to see the DeFi space gaining momentum.”    ICO déjà vu    Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges have now been rushing to list DeFi-related coins, and total value locked into assets on decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges have shot up overnight from next-to-nothing to over $13 billion in September, according to data site DeFi Pulse.      Read more: Binance, Huobi, OKEx Have FOMO for DeFi      The explosion in DeFi is reminiscent of three years ago when newfangled digital assets issued through ICOs lined investor pockets as they saturated cryptocurrency markets and gripped speculative mania. Some of the DeFi coins popping up today, like Chainlink’s LINK token, were originally promised during those ICOs tailored to bootstrapping projects and startups. Other DeFi coins, like cryptocurrency collateral system MakerDAO’s MKR token (also traded by Pantera funds), were sold in private investor rounds.      “Projects are going to market with live products that actually work (with cash flows or potential for cash flows) and with generally much higher quality teams than in 2017,” Pantera Capital went on to explain in the letter. “There’s finally a resurgence in the ICO market.”      Pantera Capital did not respond officially to requests for comment.    Stronger hedge fund returns    The recovery is remarkable considering the four Pantera Capital funds suffered tremendously in 2018 and 2019 when cryptocurrency markets imploded, with the exception of the bitcoin fund in 2019. In 2018 then in 2019, the bitcoin fund lost 75.6% then made back 87.7%; the digital asset fund lost 87.2% then 1.9%; the regular ICO fund lost 83.1% then 23.5%; and the long-term ICO fund lost 9.6% in both years.      According to cryptocurrency exchange analytics website CoinGecko, peak market capitalizations had deflated between 35% and 100% before 2020 for most tokens, with some facing regulatory enforcement actions.      Read more: Ex-Pantera Partner’s New Crypto Fund Is ‘Not for the Faint of Heart’      Trading started in November 2017 in the Pantera digital asset fund, July 2017 in the regular ICO fund, and December 2017 in the long-term ICO fund. By the end of 2017, as cryptocurrency prices surged, the regular Pantera ICO fund was returning 347.6% and the long-term Pantera ICO fund was returning 6%. That year alone, the Pantera bitcoin fund, which began passively buying and holding BTC in July 2013, and later the splinter currency bitcoin cash (BCH), returned 1,565%, yielding the fund’s highest life-to-date return yet of 25,000%.      Now, the life-to-date returns are 144.4% in the regular ICO fund and 216.3% in the long-term ICO fund. The Pantera digital asset fund’s life-to-date return still lags, down 27.1% historically, but marks an improvement from losing almost all its money, having sunk by 72.8% in total value by the end of December. The Pantera ICO funds were also returning negatively by then, having fallen 42.2% in life-to-date value in the regular ICO fund and 14.5% in the long-term ICO fund.    Deep DeFi pockets    The clawback may be due not only to Pantera Capital holding DeFi tokens that happen to be launching in a boom time, but also to the leverage it has in holding large amounts of them, magnifying their returns.      Pantera Capital is one of the largest investors, if not the largest, in Polkadot’s first token sale that raised $144.63 million, earlier investor materials from April 2018 have indicated. The Polkadot blockchain raised $43.3 million in a second token sale in July, and the Polkadot token itself, purchased by investors for less than $2 per new DOT ($200 per old DOT), has been trading below $7 per new DOT ($700 per old DOT) since the blockchain went live in August.      Pantera Capital is confirmed in the April 2018 materials to also have been the largest investor in the Origin decentralized data-sharing protocol’s token sale, until new investors blurred the leading position, along with 17 other token sales for decentralized technologies, including for Kyber, Icon, OmiseGo, 0x and Enigma, in which it had the highest discount. These 18 token sales have raised at least $10 million each, adding up to over $500 million.

Soon, the ICO funds will also trade NEAR decentralized application protocol and Filecoin decentralized file-sharing tokens.      Financial filings say Pantera’s crypto-asset funds manage over $195 million together and let investors cash out on their $100,000-plus bitcoin investments daily and alternative coin investments monthly.

42432746,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1EJh,1601043938,Bitcoin's Bearish September Has Kneecapped Crypto ETP Activity: Report,"Bitcoin's bearish price performance this month has prompted investors to pull out of some crypto derivatives products, with trading volumes taking a nosedive as a result.    A CryptoCompare report published Thursday shows volumes for cryptocurrency-based exchange-traded-products (ETPs) have fallen to a fraction of what they were in August.  Average daily volumes have fallen 75% from $186.5 million in mid-August to just $48 million by the middle of September, the firm wrote.  The slump was experienced across the board with product providers in both Europe and North America, including Deutsche Boerse XETRA, feeling the pinch.  August had been a record month for crypto derivatives generally, as CoinDesk reported at the time.  CryptoCompare's report doesn't include volumes from products that run on unregulated derivative providers, such as BitMEX or Binance.  Market leader Grayscale saw volumes for its Bitcoin Trust fall to just $40 million a day (pictured above).  Its Ethereum and Ethereum Classic products have lost nearly 65% of their value since June, something CryptoCompare puts down to waning interest among investors.  Grayscale is part of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.  Crypto derivatives track the price performance of selected digital assets, usually bitcoin, through a product that's tradeable on regulated stock exchanges.  As such, they are popular with investors who want to gain exposure to the digital asset market through a traditional instrument.  Constantine Tsavliris, CryptoCompare's head of research, told CoinDesk investors may have been put off as bearish market sentiment grew.  In the first week of September, bitcoin fell from $12,000 to $10,000, but has since recovered to trade around $10,613 at press time, according to CoinDesk bitcoin data.  But negative feelings still pervade the market. The Fear and Greed Index, a consolidated sentiment tool for digital assets, is currently at 46, suggesting traders are still mildly bearish.  ""ETP investors generally invest long-term, and therefore the recent drop in price combined with a generally bearish market has likely encouraged more cautious trading activity,"" Tsavliris said.

42432738,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1E1h,1601042411,MicroBT Sets Up First Offshore Bitcoin Miner Factory to Expand US Market Share,"Chinese bitcoin miner manufacturer MicroBT is looking to grab a bigger slice of the U.S. market by setting up its first overseas production center.      The company said on Friday that it has partnered with New York-based Foundry Digital LLC and a Southeast Asian company in order to improve supply chain efficiencies for North American buyers of its flagship bitcoin mining equipment.      The Southeast Asian listed company – which MicroBT declined to name – is contracted to produce and deliver MicroBT's WhatsMiner equipment to U.S. investors, who would otherwise pay an additional 25% tax if they receive shipments directly from China due to U.S. tariffs.      The strategy is similar to that adopted by Beijing-based Bitmain, which contracts a production factory in Malaysia responsible for overseas manufacturing and shipments.      As part of the deal, Foundry, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG) that provides miner financing and procurement for institutions in North America, will be the first to receive new batches of MicroBT's WhatsMiner M30S equipment produced in the Southeast Asian facility.      DCG, which wholly owns CoinDesk, previously said it plans to invest more than $100 million into its Foundry business through 2021 to provide loans to bitcoin mining clients as well as buying equipment for them in bulk.      “With our collaboration and MicroBT’s upgraded production capabilities, we look forward to continuing to facilitate the timely procurement and delivery of the latest generation bitcoin mining hardware for our clients, who are institutional cryptocurrency miners in North America,” said Mike Colyer, CEO of Foundry.      The move also underscores MicroBT's effort to keep challenging Beijing-based Bitmain's dominance in the bitcoin miner market, both domestically and overseas.      MicroBT managed to boost its market share by selling some 600,000 WhatsMiner units worth more than $500 million in 2019. This coincided with Bitmain's ongoing internal turmoil, which has caused notable production and shipment delays.      “The Foundry team’s in-depth understanding of the mining business and regional expertise have already helped us in making the initial tests of this new supply chain a success,” said MicroBT's COO Jiangbing Chen. “We will continue working closely with Foundry to provide the highest quality of machines and after-sale services to our customers in North America.""

42432751,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1ERh,1601039305,First Mover: Tron's Play for WBTC Shows Competition to Relieve Ethereum Congestion,"Compared with the traditional financial system, the cryptocurrency industry is evolving fast. Technologists are experimenting with the vast-reaching potential of blockchain. And regulation is typically immature, inconsistent and unevenly applied across international borders, allowing entrepreneurs to move fast and break things, as it were.      But there's also no shortage of competition. The latest example comes from CoinDesk's Ian Allison, who reported Thursday that Tron, the three-year-old blockchain headed by Justin Sun (the crypto executive who paid $4.5 million to have a meal with Warren Buffett), has entered into a strategic alliance with custody specialist BitGo to accommodate wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) tokens.      Wrapped bitcoin is a tokenized version of the largest cryptocurrency, reformatted so it can move easily on a non-Bitcoin blockchain. It's become popular among users of the Ethereum blockchain partly because traders can deposit the tokens in various decentralized finance or ""DeFi"" applications to receive juicy interest rates. Bitcoin doesn't pay interest or dividends, a fact that sometimes draws comparisons to a ""pet rock."" So DeFi is one of the main places that holders of bitcoin can go to make money off their holdings, aside from the usual speculative price gains.      As documented recently by CoinDesk's Will Foxley and Zack Voell, tokenized versions of bitcoin, including WBTC, now total more than $1.1 billion. Just Thursday, the cryptocurrency fund Three Arrows minted some 2,316 WBTC tokens, the largest-ever single issuance, for use on the Ethereum blockchain, Voell reported. Later in the day, Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of the crypto fund Alameda, tweeted an Ethererum blockchain data scan suggesting that a new transaction had occurred to break that record.      The past few months' explosion in DeFi, with the debut of automated trading platforms like Uniswap and copycat SushiSwap, has jammed the Ethereum network with congestion, driving up transaction fee rates and prompting rival blockchains to offer competing venues for developing new applications.      Now Tron apparently wants a piece of the thriving DeFi business. “Our new strategic alliance with Tron creates even greater opportunities for users to expand to other chains and tokenize their BTC,"" BitGo CEO Mike Belshe said in a statement. That means ""transacting at a lower cost and faster speed.”      There is so much more development and activity taking place on Ethereum that DeFi traders are unlikely to decamp en masse to Tron. But it's good for the industry that they have the option.    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin's 5% gain on Thursday confirmed its biggest single-day percentage gain since July 27.      While the recovery from weekly lows near $10,200 has been impressive, the immediate bias remains neutral. That's because the cryptocurrency has yet to violate the three-week trading range of $10,000 to $11,000.      A big move could happen soon, since the one-month implied volatility has declined to 44%, the lowest level in nearly two years, according to data source Skew. In the past, an implied volatility of 50% or below has consistently paved the way for violent price action.      The gauge is now closing on the record low of 35% seen just ahead of the big crash from $6,000 to $4,500 seen in the second half of November 2018.      - Omkar Godbole    Token Watch    Ether (ETH): Traders might be using options market to hedge price risks of ether locked in DeFi liquidity pools.      Bitcoin (BTC): Options open interest hits record $2.1B with notional value of $1B set to expire Friday, potentially triggering volatility.      Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC): Three Arrows Capital mints 2,316 of the Ethereum-ready tokens, single largest issuance.      Avalanche (AVAX): Tokens in smart-contract platform (and Ethereum competitor) shoot up to $4 each, providing fast paper profit for investors who bought in just two months ago at 85 cents each in a $42M fundraise, Messari says.      Uniswap (UNI): Users claim 78% of existing UNI supply in first week, though Glassnode Insights op-ed argues that transition toward token-based governance via the UNI token falls far short of true decentralization.

On Thursday, bitcoin jumped almost 5% to levels above $10,750, confirming its biggest single-day gain since July 27, according to data source Coin Metrics.  With the move, the cryptocurrency found acceptance above the 100-day moving average at $10,448, which was breached to the downside earlier this week.  So far, however, the sharp recovery from weekly lows near $10,200 has failed to draw stronger buying pressure.  At press time, bitcoin is trading near $10,680, representing a 1% decline from the high of $10,789 observed during Thursday's U.S. trading hours.  The market has been a little lacking direction in recent weeks, with prices largely stuck in the $10,000 to $11,000 range since Sept. 4.  John Ng Pangilinan, managing partner at Singapore-based Signum Capital, sees a bullish revival occurring above $11,000.  ""A stronger rally would materialize if prices rise above $11,000,"" Pangilinan told CoinDesk. ""I would buy on a breakout above the psychological hurdle.""  The odds, however, may be stacked in favor of the bears, as dollar liquidity in international markets is beginning to tighten, as tweeted by macro analyst David Belle.  As such, the dollar may extend recent gains against other currencies, putting downward pressure on the cryptocurrency.  ""A break below the early September low of $9,800 would open the doors to $8,000,"" Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk.  A big move may happen soon, as bitcoin's one-month implied volatility has declined to 44% – the lowest level in nearly two years, according to data source Skew.  In the past, an implied volatility of 50% or less has paved the way for violent price action.  Currently, implied volatility closing on the all-time low of 35% seen ahead of the mid-November 2018 crash.

Second, things on Earth are improving for more than just a few as we shake off our 20th century monetary systems and our 18th century systems of governance.      There has been a radical transformation in these infrastructures of sociality for two main reasons: First, survival. The old political, monetary and communication structures simply cannot process the informational complexity necessary to sustain planetary life with 8 billion people. There are social movements demanding new forms of cooperation that take their needs and aspirations into account.      Second, there has been a growing recognition that monetary media and communications media have converged as economic media. Communication, computation and finance have already converged.    Jonathan Beller is Professor of Media Studies at Pratt Institute and member of the Economic Space Agency (ECSA) think tank. His forthcoming book, ""The World Computer: Derivative Conditions of Racial Capitalism,"" will be published by Duke University Press in 2021. This essay is part of the Internet 2030 series exploring the future of the digital economy.    The internet, though purporting to solve historical forms of inequality by flattening communications, failed to realize its collective dream. It failed in large part because although it broadened and democratized speech, its economic logic was still beholden to hierarchical capitalist models of value extraction. The internet became, without our really knowing it, an economic medium, and a medium of brutal extraction – a deterritorialized factory.      Indeed, by 2020 world communication had been turned into the most potent engine for centralized value accumulation ever created. The very infrastructure that grew precisely because it promised equality became a distributed machine for the production and intensification of inequality. By 2020, this pyramidal logic of accumulation resulted in a world where three or four individuals held half the world's wealth, and more that two billion people (population Earth, 1929) lived on $2 a day in a ""planet of slums.""      The digital revolution was a failed revolution. The economic hobbling of communication led to a collapse of governance as everyday meaning-makers were progressively disenfranchised, disempowered and dispossessed. And the internet's extractive model of value capture – long part of colonial, industrial, monopoly, imperial and financial protocols – had been imported into our communications infrastructure.      See also: 'We Blew It.' Douglas Rushkoff's Take on the Future of the Web      As computational media colonized our expressive power, our hopes and dreams along with our very struggles to survive made money for our oppressors. The farther down the food chain you were, the more true this was.    Redesigning the convergence    Now, in 2030, there is a global movement to redesign the convergence of communications and monetary media as post-capitalist economic media.      The internet of the past has been clearly grasped as an extension of capitalism that turned everyone to workers in the social factory, who are paid in company scrip, while the real value was hoarded by shareholders. The ""background monetization"" of our words, images, locations, faces and metabolic processes was recognized as a key impediment to general emancipation and as a blockade against solving world historical problems including climate change.      Indeed, some claimed (rightly from our perspective), that the economic logic of the internet in 2020 also prevented the possibility of adequately addressing the egregious forms of profitable oppression that come under various headings including ""racism"" and ""sexism,"" endemic to what was essentially racial capitalism.      No longer, it had been decided by a growing number of Earthlings by 2030, will companies and governments strip us of our expressive power, our powers to create cultures, worlds and value(s). No longer will they devalue our lives in accord with their agendas.      We will no longer alienate our ""content"" as property for someone else's platform, we will no longer provide labor for someone else's capital, we will no longer be a pawn in centralized sovereign governance that couldn't care less about us. We refuse the psychopathology and megalomania that comes from having to assert ourselves by actively denying the real conditions of existence, conditions that inexorably convert our expression into murder. In short, as one manifesto put it, ""We will no longer serve as batteries for someone else's matrix.""    Our communication is increasingly our economy, and our economy is our communication.    For many people in 2030, the battle lines are not quite as crystalline as all that. Some clearly see that the redesign of the internet as post-capitalist economic media is the key historical movement that will lead us out of the ongoing crisis that came to a head in 2020. And some are also clear that such a redesign of internet as post-capitalist economic media means as well a redesign of money itself.      These two projects, the redesign of communications and the redesign of money are actually one. We know that you only get democracy with economic democracy, and that both imply radical decentralization. We know quite well that states and banks only serve the poor... on a plate to the rich. We know that our communicative and creative activities have intrinsic value and we want to control what happens to that value (who benefits from it, what values it fosters) with our communication.      In fact, in 2030, most of us live in two worlds: Still, the old capitalist world with all of its waste of the social product on military and police that help keep people on message with regard to the “intrinsic” value of the various fiat currencies. But in addition, we partly live in and are building an emerging, post-capitalist world of shared equity, horizontal governance, trustworthy messaging and co-authored performance.      In this emerging world, we offer our capacities in and as our messages, we collaborate on the intellectual and physical creation of new projects and products, be they software, dance moves, farmed goods, anti-racist organizing. Our messages generate our currency, and our networks platform our equity. We do not convene to make decisions as with some 19th century parliament, we offer decisions as messages that people can join.      In 2030 we do not need banks to provide us with liquidity, we receive liquidity over the same medium we use to communicate; we receive it from our trust-worthy network of peers, who will share stake in our activities as we share stake in theirs.      Our communication is increasingly our economy, and our economy is our communication.      Those whose skills and values were not properly recognized by a world bound to dollars, euros and racial hierarchies, have found their networks and with that recognition and validation, and have done so in a way that translates directly not just into the too-soft currency of ""likes,"" but into economic power.      Here, everything we do that is valuable to anyone else in our network can provide us with liquidity, units of credit on a secure, distributed computing fabric that is collectively built and owned. We provision one another's liquidity and share equity in cooperative projects. We create our own value and do so in accord with our values.      See also: Joon Ian Wong - A New Era of Media Begins With Tokenization      The ""tokens"" we issue one another are spendable in our networks, and can, if desired be cashed out to interface with the capitalist economy that still persists, but is, we wager, receding. I say that we wager on that recession of capitalism (indeed we do bet on it – we ""short"" capital and put our resources in post-capitalist economic media), because the internet in 2030, the economic medium that is available for us to use, is itself an offer.      The collectively owned internet of 2030 provides a convivial space of sociality and economy that is not only non-extractive, it is both cooperative and trustworthy because of its peer-to-peer network architecture and issuance protocols. These protocols allow us to create forms of postmodern kinship with trusted peers who are known to us by reputation and interaction histories that can be both measured and felt.      We receive equity in the infrastructure of post-capitalist economic media in exchange for our participation. Accordingly, we move more and more of our economic activity into this medium, one both semiotic and monetary, because it feels better and is more rewarding. It offers the capacity to scale decision making and to finance ideas (futures) that appreciate in value as they are appreciated and that in drawing interest can be self-actualizing.    Crypto as an emergent medium    Although secure messaging and protocolized issuance began to reengineer aspects of the social contract by creating new consensus mechanisms and immutable ledgers, the real breakthrough emerged when all messaging on secure, distributed computing did not have to be reduced to ""price"" or a single denomination, that is when all information in the network did not have to be collapsed into a quantitative amount of a single value such as dollars or bitcoin.      Though primitive, Bitcoin was like photography in 1845 or cinema in 1900, a new medium answering historical needs and promising an incredible if barely imaginable future.      With the rise of crypto, finance became an expressive medium and value could be multiply denominated in a variety of interoperable secure networks themselves organized by users for their own purposes. In the mid-2020s, in response to social movements seeking access to liquidity and new forms of cooperation, platforms emerged such that those who created value recognized by others could be those who received value.      See also: Paul Brody - How Small Business Can Achieve 'Economies of Scale' by 2030      ""Value"" was no longer a one-dimensional (dollar denominated) monologue. It became possible to value, in economic terms, ""externalities"" such as care, the environment, and indigenous forms of life. The wagers that people made in the realm of culture (as they did on say Instagram or TikTok, but also as novelists or technologists or social architects), could, by the late 2020s themselves aggregate participation in complex ways to accomplish their own ends.      Sharing ideas and images became ways of working together, of scripting projects, amalgamating energies and participating in the development of collectively held dreams. Thus today, in 2030, most of us try to build at least some of our relationships and economy on post-capitalist economic media in order to issue futures that we want to make real and also to avoid the extractive logics of a capitalist world that though in recession will not disappear without a fight.      We must add that 2030 also means the further preparation for this fight so that the neo-fascism endemic to the racial capitalism of the early 2020s, bolstered by their banks and media companies, do not foreclose on the diverse futures we seek. We perceive that if we can create an economy that allows broad-spectrum values to persist while offering a collective authorship of options, that is, of futures, we will move towards the horizontalization and democratization of communication and finance, and thus, we might survive.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Jonathan Beller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/25/how-we-short-capitalism-and-finance-the-revolution,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d02aa97b3022f7c96a8b5dcd17bc22c8ceb7c58-1728x1168.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432734,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1Dth,1601034930,OneCoin Investors Allege BNY Mellon Aided $4B Fraud,"Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) has been accused of playing a ""central role"" in the $4 billion Ponzi scheme OneCoin, just days after the publication of the so-called FinCEN Files.      Accusing it of ""turning a blind eye"" and ""laundering"" approximately $300 million for the scheme, investors Donald Berdeaux and Christine Grablis have added one of America's oldest banks to an existing class-action lawsuit seeking damages against OneCoin and its key figures, including founder Ruja Ignatova, who disappeared in late 2017.      The plaintiffs, who together invested approximately $1 million into OneCoin, say that while BNY Mellon processed payments for OneCoin in May 2016, and even referred to it as a possible ""Ponzi/pyramid scheme"" in an internal investigation that December, it didn't file a suspicious activity report (SAR) with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) until February 2017.      ""Accordingly, BNY Mellon knowingly participated in, or was complicit in, laundering OneCoin’s criminal proceeds,"" the filing reads.      Plaintiffs accuse BNY Mellon on one count of aiding and abetting fraud, as well as one count of commercial bad faith.      In a statement, a BNY Mellon spokesperson said the bank took ""its role in protecting the integrity of the global financial system seriously"" but, by law, would not comment on any SAR it may have filed with the U.S authorities.      The bank declined to comment on the allegations.      See also: US Moves to Seize $400M From Convicted OneCoin Money Launderer      The amended suit comes days after news source BuzzFeed released thousands of normally secret SARs reports flagging suspect transactions with the authorities.      One particular transaction in 2016 saw $30 million wired from an account belonging to a British Virgin Islands-based company, to BNY Mellon, who then credited it to an account in Hong Kong. While the transaction was allegedly a loan for the purchase of an oilfield, emails seized by the authorities show the loan was never repaid and that $10 million was actually withdrawn by one of the OneCoin founders.      U.S. authorities have already testified, in a separate case, that they believe this loan was an example of proceeds from the OneCoin sale being laundered.      David Silver, the founder of Silver Miller, the law firm acting as lead class counsel, told CoinDesk the FinCEN Files showed BNY Mellon could have and should have taken action much sooner than it did. ""The allegations in the lawsuit expose information that Bank of New York knew about the highly-suspicious nature of those OneCoin transactions but failed to act accordingly,"" he said.      Ignatova's brother, Konstantin, was dropped from the class-action filed by Berdeaux and Grablis last month after the two sides reached a settlement.

42432744,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1EBh,1601033593,OCC's First Issued Guidance for Stablecoins Brings More Questions,"Earlier this week stablecoin issuers received a reassuring message from some of the top U.S. financial regulators: parking your fiat reserves in banks is A-OK.      On Monday, the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), under the U.S. Department of the Treasury, issued official guidance declaring that national banks and federal savings associations can hold reserve funds for stablecoin issuers. It was a signal for these issuers to continue what they already have been doing for years.      Indeed, the dollar-backed stablecoin market nearly quadrupled in size over the past year – from around $5 billion in September 2019 to around $19 billion currently – with much of that wealth backed by reserves held in bank accounts. Much of this growth has been driven by international demand for dollars as well as the increasingly sophisticated financial tools being built on top of public blockchain technology. Since its inception, however, the stablecoin market has existed amid regulatory ambiguity.      The new ruling, the first federal guidance issued regarding stablecoins, adds legitimacy to the booming market sector and paves the way for more banks to enter the ecosystem, say industry commentators. Still, it’s unclear whether the mandate will have any short-term significance.      “If you don't have guidance from the banking regulator about how banks can participate in those schemes – or arrangements, rather – that would limit growth. It paves the way for growth,” Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle said over Zoom. “But it doesn’t change the way Circle operates today.”      See also: SEC, OCC Issue First Regulatory Clarifications for Stablecoins      Allaire isn’t alone in his thinking. “The letter indicates a positive sentiment coming from a top government agency,” Kristen Smith, founder of the Blockchain Association, a D.C. crypto advocacy group, said. “Will it have any major practical changes for the way fiat-backed stablecoins operate? Probably not.”      Still unanswered is whether the mandate will be enough to draw in national banks. As with the OCC’s letter this summer declaring that federally regulated banks can custody crypto, simply granting permission will not necessarily make it so.      CoinDesk reached out for comment from several top U.S. banking institutions. By press time, we had yet to hear back.      “It felt like a big bang. Like, woah, Bank of America now allows you to deposit bitcoin,” Allaire said, referring hyperbolically to the crypto-custody letter.      “These are slow-burn types of things. Banks don’t move at the speed of crypto,"" Allaire said. Though he does expect there to be a gradual number of banks that publicly disclose they're entering the space, ""reflecting a comfort around this financial infrastructure.”    Will it have any major practical changes for the way fiat-backed stablecoins operate? Probably not.    In a statement announcing the latest guidance, Acting Comptroller of the Currency and Coinbase alumnus Brian Brooks noted that with or without explicit permission, banks have already engaged in “stablecoin related activities involving billions of dollars each day.”      And with the “greater regulatory certainty” his agency has provided will come billions of dollars more in stablecoin issuances and transaction volumes, the reasoning goes.      “We see a world where there are tens of billions of dollars, trillions ultimately, of value in circulation using digital dollar stablecoins,” Allaire said. “As the amount of USDC in circulation grows, we’ll need more banking capacity.”      Currently, all USDC reserves are parked in U.S. Bancorp Asset Management (USBAM), a registered investment adviser and subsidiary of U.S. Bank National Association. Allaire doesn’t see cause to immediately shake up that arrangement or add new banking partners.      See also: Frances Coppola – The Stablecoin Surge Is Built on Smoke and Mirrors      “I don't think we've wrapped our heads around it yet and are ready to speak about what this means for the industry,” Becky McClain, director of communications for Paxos, another leading stablecoin issuer, said in an email.      Other stablecoin issuers, including Gemini, did not make themselves available for comment.      While the letter does provide some clarity around the nature of fiat-reserves for stablecoins, several industry leaders remain unsure about finer details.      “We are still trying to figure out what exactly is going here. I will let you know when our thoughts are in order,” Neeraj Agrawal, director of communications Coin Center, a Washington D.C.-based digital asset public policy organisation, said over email.      “I don't think folks have realized how potentially confusing and wrongheaded this hosted wallet detail in the recent OCC interpretation might be,” Coin Center Director of Research Peter Van Valkenburgh tweeted Tuesday.      In the guidance, the OCC writes that it is allowing banks to manage funds kept in a “hosted” wallet, an address that would essentially represent the relevant stablecoin’s reserves. The watchdog adds, “We are not presently addressing the authority to support stablecoin transactions involving un-hosted wallets.”      “Un-hosted wallets” seem to refer to addresses individuals or businesses would control. This distinction has caused some confusion, with Coin Center’s Jerry Brito raising the question whether this points to a possible prohibition on banking firms that support un-hosted wallets.      “You have to remember the OCC has limited jurisdiction,” Blockchain Association’s Smith said. “They regulate banks.” Though Smith said the line is ambiguous, she pushes back on the idea that it could have unhelpful implications for the larger stablecoin market.      “The OCC does not regulate peer-to-peer transactions, they regulate transactions involving minting and burning stablecoins,” she said – an activity that would involve a hosted wallet. “It’s not to say you can't have un-hosted wallets. It’s saying they don't have authority over un-hosted wallets.”    Clearly, the technology is there, but governments will ultimately take a position on what's an acceptable level of anonymity for digital cash.    Further questions lie around what an increased banking presence would mean for customer privacy.      According to the guidance, stablecoin reserves held at banks will be subject to compliance standards under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Patriot Act and other anti-money laundering regulations.      In a world where stablecoins are part of “mainstream, everyday use,” there will have to be “a balance between meeting needs of national security and keeping personal and business transactions private,” Smith said. The legislation hasn’t pointed out the direction this may take.      “The debate hasn't fully played out,” she said. Allaire agreed.      “It’s a policy question. Clearly, the technology is there, but governments will ultimately take a position on what's an acceptable level of anonymity for digital cash,” he said. Allaire takes a general purpose view of digital dollars: saying they could be used for anything a dollar is used for including as collateral in municipal bonds, in trade finance invoices or to buy coffee at the corner bodega.      “They’re superpowered dollars,” Allaire said. With increased programmability comes increased utility value. “I think the use cases go well-beyond anything we’ve thought of yet.”      See also: Marc Hochstein – Money Reimagined: Let’s Be Privacy Scolds      It’s a frame of reference that seems to comport with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) stance on fiat-backed stablecoins as a type of “store-of-value” rather than an investment.      Also announced Monday, the SEC said whether a particular stablecoin falls under their jurisdiction is “a facts and circumstances determination.” The agency also said it is willing to publish a “no-action” letter, which would assure the recipient that the regulator would not bring an enforcement action against the company.      “The SEC is saying fiat-backed, fully-reserved stablecoins are not securities,” Allaire said, adding that it is taking a “come talk to us and we’ll verify” approach. While this opens the door for companies like Circle to engage with the SEC, it doesn’t answer its questions directly.      “You can't read too much into it because it says so little,” he said, adding, “This raises more questions and concerns.” A wide range of stablecoins may in fact be securities, including those that are algorithmically derived and those that are not provably fully-backed.      Still, Allaire said: “You should expect to see a request for no action.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/09/25/occs-first-issued-guidance-for-stablecoins-brings-more-questions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0777368ae18a00434a6e56a17d6957d8563876ec-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432739,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1E5h,1601031792,China State Media Make Rare Reports Calling Crypto 2020's Best Performing Asset,"Several Chinese state-owned media have made coordinated reports describing cryptocurrencies as the year's top performing investment.    China Central Television (CCTV), the country's top broadcaster, published a three-minute news clip on Friday that highlighted crypto assets have soared by 70% this year so far.  The report added that ""cryptocurrency has undoubtedly become the top performing investment"" among various global assets.  CCTV's clip followed the state-owned news agency Xinhua, which published an online article Thursday entitled ""Cryptocurrency is this year's 'No. 1 asset.'""  The same article first appeared on the Thursday print version of Cankaoxiaoxi and was a summarized translation of an article from Bloomberg on Tuesday.  Cankaoxiaoxi is one of the longest running state media that selectively translates news reports from foreign sources, including those that are normally blocked by China's Great Firewall.  The CCTV clip immediately drew wide attention from the Chinese crypto community.  Many started sharing the clip on WeChat news feeds as a bullish signal since the unusual neutral-to-positive tone is seemingly at odds with China's stance that crypto speculation could undermine financial stability.  Such a rare and coordinated effort also sparked some to wonder what the real intention and nuance might be, since state-owned media in China typically carry political agendas.  Citing Bloomberg's index, CCTV said the yield of crypto asset has this year surpassed that of gold, which has risen only 20%.  The broadcaster said various countries' economic stimulus plans following the coronavirus pandemic and the recent mania for decentralized finance contributed to the surge of values in cryptocurrencies.  However, it also cautioned that the risks for retail investors still remain high given crypto assets' volatility.

42432747,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1EHh,1601030266,IRS May Make It Harder to Avoid Declaring Crypto on Tax Returns,"The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is about to deploy a simple trick to make it far harder for taxpayers to avoid declaring their cryptocurrency assets.    According to a Wall Street Journal report Friday, the Internal Revenue Service plans to reposition a question on the 1040 income tax form for 2020 that will require all returnees to check a box if they have transacted any crypto assets over the year.  An IRS draft of the 1040 shows the question placed near the top of the form will likely read: ""At any time during 2020, did you sell, receive, send, exchange or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?""  The question was included on the form for 2019, but was placed in a part of the document that not all returnees had to fill out, the WSJ says.  An expert on tax law told the WSJ the question would make it easier for the IRS to win cases if the taxpayer checks the ""no"" box and is later found to have held crypto.  Reporting crypto taxes in the U.S. is notoriously tricky and even the IRS has conceded things need to improve.  An official told CoinDesk in July that some of the guidance published to date could be clarified and “is not ideal.”  The IRS is working to keep up with the crypto industry, the official added.  The more prominent placement of the crypto question for 2020 may be effective, the WSJ writes.  The IRS previously added a similar question regarding taxpayers' offshore bank accounts resulted in the IRS receiving over $12 billion in taxes.

Ant said Friday its new trade platform, called ""Trusple,"" will make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to sell their wares to clients overseas.  Built on AntChain, Trusple automates key aspects of the payments process, such as order placement and tax liabilities.  This makes cross-border trades feasible for entities that would otherwise struggle had they used legacy systems, according to the firm.  Ant has partnered with the likes of Standard Chartered, Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas to help ""optimize"" the process.  The news comes as Ant continues to stoke up investor enthusiasm for its upcoming dual initial public offering (IPO) next month in Hong Kong and China's tech-focused STAR Market.  The company, a sister to Alibaba Group, is looking to raise a record $35 billion, surpassing the $29.4 billion Saudi Aramco raised last December.  Ant – last valued at $200 billion – is best known as the operator of Alipay, one of the two primary payment apps used China.  But the firm has an increasing presence in the cryptocurrency space: Chinese shipping giant Cosco has trialed AntChain to speed up the documentation process and Ant is believed to be one of the primary issuing partners for the upcoming digital yuan.

42432748,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1ELh,1601024410,Fintech Giant Plaid Has a Hidden Passion for DeFi,"Fintech enabler Plaid, which connects traditional bank accounts to thousands of digital platforms, including crypto exchange Coinbase, is quietly working with at least two decentralized finance (DeFi) startups.      Plaid’s head of U.K., Keith Grose, a former Google wallet builder, has a vision for how crypto (and DeFi) will evolve in tandem with the fintech revolution his company is said to be driving.      The company confirmed integrations with Dharma, the Uniswap-friendly DeFi wallet with early backing from Coinbase and others; and Teller Finance, the DeFi startup looking to bring unsecured lending to the Ethereum blockchain.      Open banking and DeFi may occupy quite different levels of digitization’s evolutionary ladder, but Grose sees a “common democratizing thesis” when it comes to accessing and using financial assets.      “I think it’s still a long way before DeFi becomes part of the main route for finance, but it’s a really exciting corner and one that personally I'm passionate about,” Grose told CoinDesk.      Still, nobody would deny DeFi is a stretch for regular fintech. Systems that are completely open to anyone, and where participants’ identities are essentially hidden behind a wallet address, present problems in today’s digital world. But people in Silicon Valley or Wall Street aren’t stupid, they attempt to manage their own disruption, and to some extent even buy into it. Take for example the way enterprise has tried to embrace blockchain, or perhaps the lengths Visa went to in acquiring Plaid earlier this year.      Read more: This DeFi Group Wants to Bring Maturity to the Yield Farming Craze      Armed with a widely used API and a huge $5.3 billion exit earlier this year thanks to Visa, Plaid has become instrumental in opening up consumer finance by allowing transaction data to be shared with third-party fintech platforms.      But persuading banks to open up to fintech is just the beginning, says Grose, who sees crypto as a next logical step.    ‘Scratching the surface’    “We’re only scratching the surface of what open banking can do because it only covers payment accounts,” Grose said. “I think a key thing is to be able to allow people to access and use their crypto assets in tandem with more traditional budgeting applications, payment applications. There’s no reason why, longer-term, your Coinbase account or your Compound wallet could not be included in that so you can track it and use it across many other traditional applications.”      In Grose’s personal opinion, “protocols like Compound that provide an APY on crypto assets have been a long time coming and are a really exciting and super interesting step because that’s when you start to get the point of having the financial ecosystem and the whole space for lenders.”      Another area that excites Grose is decentralized derivatives exchanges like the Andreessen Horowitz-backed dYdX.      “What you’re starting to see, for better or for worse, are some aspects of traditional, high-tech trading firms coming to the retail investor on the DeFi side,” Grose said. “There’s danger in that. But I think ultimately, there are interesting democratization aspects to it as well. Can the average person access financial tools in the future that have traditionally been quite hard to access as a retail investor?”    Streamlining DeFi    The practicalities of what Plaid can do, even providing a holistic view of all your assets with real-time data flowing in and out of a crypto trade you just made, for example, remains poles apart from DeFi, which combines the idea of decentralized exchange (DEXs) with crypto lending, adding a steroid shot of token drops to drive liquidity.      But in the future, a fintech plumbing company like Plaid could play a role in making access to realms like DeFi less daunting, said Howard Krieger, CEO of digital asset lending platform Residual.      “For someone to use DeFi, they have to go through a series of trust exercises before they can participate,” said Krieger. “A company like Plaid can eliminate a whole bunch of risk because they hold information and have the ability to plug different parties together; if Plaid has already verified who I am, that KYC/AML requirement goes away. So I can see where a plumbing company like Plaid could streamline a lot of back-office processes.”      Read more: Uniswap Users Have Claimed $560M-Worth of UNI Tokens in a Week      Indeed, the reason Plaid has had an explosive impact, said Grose, is that in order to build applications like Venmo, Robinhood and Coinbase, you need to be able to easily connect bank accounts, authenticate and transfer funds – and building a slick user experience around this is essential.      “When you think about what will be needed for DeFi to take off, a lot is around the user experience and making this accessible to people who are not really deep in crypto,” Grose said. “I think you’re going to see roles for players like us, helping the ecosystem develop longer-term because one of the things holding back DeFi is that it is still a lot of work to actually get up and running. You have to go quite deep into a knowledge base to really get started.”    Cambrian swamp    It’s hard to see how DeFi’s pseudonymous clusters of lenders and borrowers might cross-pollinate traditional fintechs like Funding Circle or SoFi, which rely on knowing as much as possible about counterparties on the platform.      “That’s definitely a difficulty,” Grose said. “If everything is hidden behind the wallet address, that’s completely against the regulation you have to have, in terms of doing lending on any sort of institutional or traditional scale. At some point, there will have to be bridges built there.”      But as a recent opinion piece on CoinDesk points out, nobody knows what will crawl onto land and evolve from crypto’s Cambrian swamp.      Read more: Banks Are Toast but Crypto Has Lost Its Soul      For Paul Brody, blockchain lead at EY and co-founder of Ethereum-based Baseline Protocol, the priority is getting DeFi going with privacy so enterprises can use it.      “I hope that’s where DeFi is headed,” said Brody. “Right now, as a consumer product, all this yield farming, SushiSwapping is interesting but not useful. The purpose of financial markets is to allocate capital for productive use. I’m not sure that’s happening here.”      Update (Sept. 25, 14:42 UTC): Changed headline and added language to clarify that Visa's acquisition of Plaid has yet to be finalized.",NEUTRAL,UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | UNI,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/25/fintech-giant-plaid-has-a-hidden-passion-for-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/439b1f169a66c25084133b410f57c4cbc4c731b4-1500x1004.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a report from Bloomberg Thursday, Brainard is seen as someone who would appeal to both Wall Street and progressives.  Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is also being considered, is seen as too progressive for Wall Street, nine individuals ""familiar with the candidates and Biden's thinking"" told Bloomberg.  Biden is also said to be keen to pick a woman for the role – a historic move, as the Treasury secretary has always been a white male.  The presidential hopeful seeks a secretary who would help drive the economic recovery after the knock from the coronavirus pandemic and avoid dividing Democrats, per the report.  One Bloomberg source said Brainard would prefer the role of Federal Reserve chair, but would accept the Treasury secretary role if asked.  While she may appease conservatives on Wall Street, Brainard is progressive when it comes to technology, having been involved with the Fed's efforts to research a digital dollar.  She has made several announcements on the ongoing research into the possible central bank digital currency (CBDC) based on distributed ledger technology.  She said in August the Fed has been studying for several years what effect a digital currency might have on the payments ecosystem, monetary policy, financial stability and the banking sector.  ""Given the dollar's important role, it is essential that the Federal Reserve remain on the frontier of research and policy development regarding CBDCs,"" she said at the time.  An economist told Bloomberg that if Biden were to choose Brainard, it would signal to the markets he ""intends to govern as a moderate, not give in to the progressive wing.""  It's not a done deal, however, with ex-Fed Reserve official Roger Ferguson and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic also on the list – both are black men.  Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former deputy secretary at the Treasury, is also keen on the role, the sources said.

42432750,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1EPh,1600997167,"Stablecoins Hit $20B Milestone, a Nearly 300% Year-to-Date Surge","The total value of stablecoins has now surpassed $20 billion, reflecting the growing demand of investors looking to hedge their risks in both crypto and traditional markets amid the coronavirus pandemic.    Data from Coin Metrics shows the total value of assets for all stablecoins breached the $20 billion mark Thursday, only a little more than four months after the number broke a $10 billion record in May. Stablecoins are digital tokens, the values of which are pegged to fiat currencies like U.S. dollars.  The main driver of the most recent rise is the latest downward pricing trend in non-stablecoin digital currencies such as bitcoin, according to John Todaro, director of institutional research at cryptocurrency analysis firm TradeBlock.  “Because some exchanges do not offer fiat pairs, stablecoins are the only available option for traders to move risk off into fiat-like assets during periods of volatility,” Todaro wrote in an email response to CoinDesk.  More traders and individuals view stablecoins as an intermediary step before putting money in riskier cryptocurrencies. After purchasing the stablecoins with U.S. dollars or other government-issued currencies, they can move the stablecoins to exchanges and trade for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ether or others.  Data from crypto data site Glassnode shows the balance on exchanges for tether, the most popular stablecoin by market capitalization, hit its all-time high in April.  The increased supply of stablecoin also caused higher liquidity in both crypto trading and transactions last week, Glassnode’s weekly report wrote on Sept. 21.  The surge of stablecoin demand may also be because of heightened interest in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Stablecoins are used by DeFi users to receive high yields from a variety of DeFi platforms, such as Uniswap, Curve and Aave.  With more political uncertainty, stablecoins are also being used by individuals and corporations to “bypass capital controls and other enforcements in order to move USD-like assets around,” said Todaro.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/25/stablecoins-hit-20b-milestone-a-nearly-300-year-to-date-surge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d6a54215348624ee5fee50b51f44400862047dd-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
