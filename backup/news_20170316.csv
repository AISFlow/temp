The tax agency’s fight to obtain records on users between the years 2013 and 2015 has entered a new chapter, coming months after the IRS first sought court approval for its ""John Doe"" subpoena in November. Since then, both Coinbase and one of its customers, Jeffrey Berns, have filed to intervene in the case in a bid to stop what both parties have blasted as a regulatory overreach.  To date, Coinbase has not provided that data to the government, sparking today's petition to ""enforce the summons"", according to public records.  Coinbase said that it was reviewing the new filing and indicated that it could move to launch further court challenges in light of the subpoena.  The startup told CoinDesk:    ""Our legal team is in the process of reviewing the IRS’s motion. We will continue to work with the IRS to assess the government’s willingness to fundamentally reconsider the focus and scope of the summons. If it does not, we anticipate filing opposition papers in court in coming months. We will continue to keep our customers updated as to status.""            First starting in November 2016, the IRS sought court permission to serve a summons to Coinbase to identify potential tax evaders. The IRS began regulating bitcoin as a taxable form of property in 2014, though the agency has faced criticism from within the government regarding its approach to digital currencies.  The original subpoena request was initially approved by a federal judge, and a counter effort, led by Berns, soon followed. A hearing on recent filings is set for 23rd March.

42399675,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyP7M,1489690539,"Bloq Launches Blockchain Lab, Joins Enterprise Ethereum","Blockchain startup Bloq has moved to back a pair of new initiatives centered on open-source development.  The firm said today that it has launched a new lab geared toward supporting open-source projects, while also revealing that it has joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.  The dual announcements are part of a larger push by the company, founded by bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik and investor Matthew Roszak in 2016, to advance adoption of blockchain applications.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Garzik said he hopes to leverage his team’s history working with Red Hat and the Linux Foundation to bring some clarity to enterprises looking to work with open-source developers – and vice versa.  Speaking with CoinDesk, Garzik said:  ""Whether it’s bitcoin, ethereum, Enterprise Ethereum, to me it’s all the same pattern. We’ve got to get off this amateur hour in terms of standards making.""  The open-source laboratory announced today is called BloqLabs, described by Garzik as akin to Bell Labs in the 1900s. BloqLabs will promote open-source initiatives similar to the way AT&T helped promote telecommunications at the turn of the century.  Among the projects included thus far: Drivechains, Qtum, Veriblock, bitcoinj and the Android Bitcoin Wallet. The lab will pair these open-source projects with other industry members in the blockchain space, according to Garzik.  As part of the push, Bloq has become the first new member to join the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance since it was launched last month.  According to Garzik, his goal in joining the group is to help bridge the gap between the open-source community who helped build the foundation which enterprises are now exploring, and those larger companies themselves.  He told CoinDesk:  ""You meet in the middle, a sort of Switzerland between the crazy enterprise guys and the crazy open-source guys...let's meet in the middle and make a compromise to create something workable.""

42399670,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyP2R,1489688746,'Blockchain Revolution' Authors Launch Enterprise Research Effort,"A group of global governments, tech firms and blockchain startups have announced the launch of a new initiative dubbed the Blockchain Research Institute.  The syndicated research group said it is committed to the academic analysis of the impacts of blockchain on a wide range of industries, including financial services, retail and manufacturing, along with the impact of the tech on a number of executive level professions.  In addition to the focus on how blockchain will impact actual jobs, the institute aims to distinguish itself from other think tanks and internal working groups by attracting the ""smartest people in the world"" with cold, hard cash.  In conversation with CoinDesk, the co-author of ""Blockchain Revolution"" and CEO of the Tapscott Group, Don Tapscott, explained his vision for a protracted research effort conducted over more than a year and funded by a basic membership fee of $200,000.  Tapscott said the institute – which is designed to give investors immediate access to tailored research conducted by a wide range of industry leaders – will eventually give away most of what it learns, explaining:  ""We want to help our members get a jump and compete, and also, after six months, a lot of this material will come into the public domain under the creative commons license. We want to create a rising tide that will lift all boats.""  'No duplication'  Founded as a non-profit organization and based in Toronto, Canada, the group of founding members include Accenture, IBM, SAP, Digital Asset, NASDAQ, Pepsico, the Province of Ontario and Nuco Inc.  The group is expected to spend its first year studying the impact of blockchain on eight industries, or ""vertical opportunities"", including energy, media, technology, healthcare and government.  Associate members, including Hyperledger, Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and the Chamber of Digital Commerce, are then aiming to help minimize the amount of redundant work. ""We don’t want to duplicate anything that’s already being done,"" Tapscott said.  Including access to monthly webinars and a private website to view published material, the membership – which Tapscott expects will reach 30 by the time the program launches next month – will receive a custom executive report based on the institute's findings and aimed specifically at the members' demands.  For example, in addition to the industry analyses, seven ""horizontal opportunities"" consisting of reimagined roles of various executive level positions will be offered. These will include blockchain-specific job descriptions for chief logistics officers in supply chains, chief financial officers and chief information officers.  Tapscott said:  ""There’s been virtually no work that's been done on this.""  Dedicated resources  Beyond the founding members, Tapscott points to the people actually conducting the research as a distinguishing characteristic of the group.  In a prospectus made available to CoinDesk, the researchers are divided into three categories, focusing on finance, government and the private sector.  A list of ""proposed partial faculty"" members include: Jesse McWaters of the World Economic Forum; Primavera De Philippi of the National Center for Scientific Research, Paris; Andreas Antonopoulos, the author of ""Mastering Bitcoin""; former FDIC regulator Jason Brett; chairman of VeriFi Hong Kong, Pindar Wong; and Katie Haun, the US federal prosecutor for digital currencies.  Based in part on a research methodology developed by Tapscott's Global Solutions Networks, the Blockchain Research Institute is designed to bring diverse thought leaders together for an extended period of time to meet the specific research demands of an industry-leading membership.  Non-profit reductions  Not everyone who can't afford the $200,000 price tag will have to wait the six months after the research is complete to see the results, however.  For governments, not-for-profit organizations and companies in certain verticals, lower fees are being offered.  The program is schedule to begin 3rd April and to complete 20th December, with a final Program Summit to be held for members in the spring of 2018.  Tapscott concluded:  ""At the end, they get a private briefing at their location. It's half consulting and half syndicated research.""

42399683,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyPFE,1489681820,German Central Bank Chief: Blockchain Could Make Markets Faster,"Blockchain could help fuel a broader digitization drive in finance, according to the head of Germany's central bank.  Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann spoke yesterday during an appearance at a G20 summit in Berlin. There, he highlighted the tech's potential to make financial markets and services faster, convenient and cheaper, while also noting the shifts brought about by tech advances in AI advisory services and crowdfunding.  He told attendees:  ""The question of whether digitalization will lead to a revolution in financial services and infrastructure, as some commentators argue, remains unanswered for the time being, in my view. However, one certainly can't deny that new technologies like blockchain, robo-advisors or crowd funding could have the potential to make financial markets and services faster, more efficient, more convenient, and more inexpensive for everyone.""  The comments come shortly after another appearance by Weidmann in which he spoke about blockchain. In late January, Weidmann referred to the tech as a ""multi-purpose tool"", highlighting recent research it has conducted on the subject.  Specifically, the German central bank has developed a prototype securities trading platform with exchange operator Deutsche Borse AG. Dating back to November, the project has been called promising by Bundesbank officials though they've noted it is ""still presenting many challenges"" in terms of implementation.  During his speech, Weidmann notably suggested that there is a need for new fintech-focused regulation.  ""This calls for the regulation of fintechs, at least to a certain extent. A lot of corporations using technology-enabled financial innovations operate either on a global scale or carry out a large number of cross-border transactions,"" he said.

42399676,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyP9K,1489677313,Patent Trolls Beware: 40 Firms Join Fight Against Blockchain IP Abuse,"A coalition of blockchain companies is attempting to build a defensive wall against any attempts by so-called patent trolls to steal intellectual property within the industry.  The new group, called the Blockchain Intellectual Property Council, is being announced today by the Chamber of Digital Commerce at the Blockchain Summit in Washington D.C.  Comprised of 40 founding members, the council has been set up to help blockchain startups and major corporations better navigate the delicate space that exists between giving away open-source technology and filing patents for different ways that the technology is used.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Chamber president Perianne Boring positioned the council as beneficial to a healthy blockchain ecosystem, regardless of one’s stance on intellectual property.  Boring said:  ""No matter where you are in the patent landscape, if you’re a purist who doesn’t believe in patents, or if you’re a company that is filing patents, this is a major factor in the innovation, and future innovation of the industry.""  The council is chaired by Marc Kaufman, partner at Rimon Law; Patrick Murck, special counsel at Cooley & Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard; and James Murdock, chief business officer and general counsel at Blockstream.  Founding members include Blockstream, Bloq, Civic, Cognizant, Deloitte, Digital Currency Group, Gem, Medici Ventures, Microsoft and TMX Group.  This is the Chamber's seventh initiative, and follows soon after the Smart Contracts Alliance, launched last December.  Tackling trolls  The Blockchain Intellectual Property Council was founded to accommodate an increase in questions among the Chamber's 100 members about how to create a defensive patent strategy in an ecosystem of products built largely on open-source technology.  On the organization's executive committee alone, there are at least four companies in varying stages of offering open-source code bases: Chain, Digital Asset, IBM and Microsoft. From those firms, CoinDesk knows of several patents that have already been filed.  How exactly the council might deal with competing blockchain patent applications is yet to be determined, but, at a kickoff meeting scheduled for 30th March, members are scheduled to begin hashing out the group's first set of deliverables.  A likely early priority based on feedback from the members, will be to develop a strategy for dealing with patent trolls.  Boring said:  ""Some of the big issues we’ve seen are issues of patent trolls and when the community can come together and work together in terms of addressing that, it will be very effective.""  Patent growth  In recent years, the US patent landscape has exploded across various industries.  1963 saw 90,000 patents filed at the Patent & Trademark Office – a number that had climbed to 629,000 in 2015, the most recent year for which results have been published.  To give an idea of what’s at stake, a recent report found that 84% of the value generated by S&P 500 firms comes from ""intangible assets"", a term largely defined as intellectual property.  The protection of intellectual property rights is a looming issue in the blockchain community, which is largely comprised of software products creators and platform providers, and has also seen a recent rise in hardware creation.  While occasionally controversial, Boring says patents are a crucial part of incentivizing innovators to invent – the end result of which is a more diverse ecosystem of products and more useful services  She concluded:  ""[Intellectual property] effects the entire ecosystem, and that’s what makes it important from a foundational perspective.""

42399684,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyPHC,1489675550,Ether Price Tear Continues With New All-Time High,"The price of ether, the token that powers the smart contract-based blockchain platform ethereum, continued its tear today, rising to fresh all-time highs.  At press time, the digital currency's price surged to as much as $42.89, extending recent gains after rising to record levels yesterday.  Today's continued rally has coincided with a sharp uptick in trading volume, as this morning, 96% of ether traders on asset-trading platform eToro were purchasing the digital currency, according to senior market analyst Mati Greenspan.  Ether prices have risen over the last several sessions, following the broader digital currency market higher after the SEC opted to reject the bitcoin ETF proposed by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.  Ether prices have risen more than 100% since then, climbing from a low of $17.68 on 10th March to nearly $43 today.  Analysts have pointed to several factors when explaining ether's sharp gains as of late, including tailwinds resulting from bitcoin's ongoing scaling dilemma and the robust returns offered by alternative protocol assets.

42399702,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyP8L,1489667939,Investment Firm Blockchain Capital is Launching a $10 Million ICO,"Industry VC fund Blockchain Capital plans to raise a new fund by creating a blockchain-based token and selling it to the general public.  Blockchain Capital will offer its so-called ""BCAP"" token through an ethereum-based smart contract, and tokens sold will represent shares in a new fund called Blockchain Capital III Digital Liquid Venture Fund, LP, the firm said today. In addition to the ICO, Blockchain Capital will raise funds via the traditional route through another fund, Blockchain Capital III, LP.  The fundraise is Blockchain Capital's third, coming over a year after it raised $13m for a fund focused on bitcoin and blockchain startups.  The sale is the first of its kind for a VC fund (not counting the smart-contract funding vehicle The DAO), continuing a trend of token sales that advocates say represents a new means for tapping the market for capital and that critics argue is a model prone to fraud and mismanagement.  Yet in conversation with CoinDesk, managing partner Brock Pierce positioned his firm's approach as different than others that have pursued token sales.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We're a security just like someone doing a big crowdfunding campaign, but we’re tokenizing that security. The difference is everyone else is trying to circumvent these regulations. We're saying, 'Is there a way to work within them?', and the answer is 'yes'.""  The token will be registered under Singaporean law and will be combined with Regulation S and Regulation D filings that offer crowdfunding privileges pursuant to the 2012 JOBS Act. The fund will raise $40m through traditional means and $10m through the ICO.  Complete details of the filing are expected to be released April in the official offering memorandum.  Different route  In explaining his rationale, Pierce was critical of attempts by many ICOs to avoid portraying themselves as a security to avoid regulation, saying that this practice would ultimately be harmful to the ecosystem.  ""What most people have been doing is going through and creating these convoluted structures for the purposes of circumventing regulation,"" he said. ""A bunch of these ICOs have regulatory overhang, meaning the principals behind these companies could get indicted for not having done this stuff compliantly. And that's a risk factor that I don't think anyone's assessed when looking at the various projects.""  Pierce reckoned that Blockchain Capital's issuance of a regulated token will be a game-changer because it mitigates legality questions, betters allows for potential investors to assess risk and thus opens the doors for entrepreneurs to more easily access capital.  ""We've architected our ICO acknowledging that we're a security. I believe that this will be the roadmap for everyone going forward,"" he said.  But the disruptive impacts will expand far beyond just the world of ICOs, Pierce believes.  ""We’re doing this as a way of pioneering what we think is the future model for not just venture capital, but private equity, real estate and everything else,"" he said.  Fluid approach  Another goal of the token fund is to bring greater liquidity to the venture capital asset class – an area in which solid returns are often produced, but investors’ funds can be tied up in ventures for as many as five to 10 years.  The token would allow owners to sell their ownership rights to the fund at any point in time, thus opening the door for experimentation with other traditionally illiquid asset classes such as real estate and private equity.  ""We believe everything will become tokenized and liquid. We’re doing this to actually show people how it’s done,"" Pierce said, adding that the issuance of securities on the blockchain has the potential to become the first truly killer application for ethereum.  When asked about the potential monetary returns to Blockchain Capital for being the first to pioneer the practice, Pierce emphasized that the endeavor is more about advancing the ecosystem as a whole.  ""It’s got more potential to be detrimental to our business than positive. But we’re doing it to practice what we preach,"" he said. ""We think this is going to forever change the game. When it comes to disruption – everyone is going to be disrupted – the question is whether you’re going to wait to be disrupted or are you going to disrupt yourself.""

42399681,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyPEF,1489667121,Bitcoin's Scaling Debate is Devolving Into an All-Out Twitter War,"The bitcoin world has been in something of a furore over an attack that, on Tuesday, took down most of the nodes running Bitcoin Unlimited – a controversial alternative version of the cryptocurrency's code.  Though the exact details of the attack aren't clear, here's what we know: After a couple of bitcoin users posted the link to details of a bug exploit that could allow anyone to remotely crash Bitcoin Unlimited nodes, an unknown attacker used the method to take down over two-thirds of the devices.  A 'hot fix' was released later that day, and by Wednesday, most nodes had popped back up.  The news comes a just couple of days after Bitmain's AntPool announced that it would switch its mining pool to the alternative bitcoin software, bringing miner support one step closer to the 75% hashing power threshold needed to activate Bitcoin Unlimited's rules.  Unsurprisingly, the event made a strong impression on the community, and both supporters and critics alike have been vocal in expressing their reactions to the event.  CoinDesk rounded up some of the more popular responses on Twitter (admittedly a platform that might over- rather than under-state divisions within the space) to see how developers and other bitcoin commentators reacted to the node outage.  For a general overview of the ongoing debate, read our easy explainer.  Critical feedback  Following the bug exploit, Bitcoin Unlimited’s developer team, which introduced at least one other bug earlier this year, was an obvious target for criticism, but other factors and suggestions were raised too.  1. Developers at fault  Coinbase director of engineering Charlie Lee’s concern, raised in a tweetstorm, is what would happen if Bitcoin Unlimited were the primary software.    1/ Today’s Bitcoin Unlimited node crashing bug proves that users cannot trust Bitcoin’s $20B network in the hands of BU developers.        — Charlie Lee (@SatoshiLite) March 14, 2017        2/ First, having assert(0) triggered by untrusted inputs is amateurish. Arguably OK if it was a mobile ap. Not OK for nodes backing Bitcoin!        — Charlie Lee (@SatoshiLite) March 14, 2017        3/ Second, if BU devs practiced adversarial thinking, they wouldn’t have publicly disclosed this 0-day exploit themselves!        — Charlie Lee (@SatoshiLite) March 14, 2017      2. Lack of collaboration  Others also argued that the code was not well-tested.  BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp argued that only one developer reviewed the code change that led to the crash.  Another bitcoin developer argued that even a novice coder could have been the culprit.  3. Poor review process  ""Mastering Bitcoin"" author Andreas Antonopoulos argued that, rather than blame the developers, the review process needs to be tightened.    BU bug: This isn't about individual competence. It's about a process with diverse and laborious review, which catches bugs before production        — Andreas (@aantonop) March 15, 2017        Bugs like this pop up in Core code too. The important difference: they *never* make it to production releases. The QA process catches them        — Andreas (@aantonop) March 15, 2017      4. I don't always...  Many accounts that are not associated with well-known, or known, people, also participate in the debate.  One such unknown Twitter user added to the ""code was untested"" sentiment with a meme.    @rogerkver pic.twitter.com/DGllJbnABD        — spiroseliot (@spiroseliot) March 15, 2017      5. Mining pool confusion  Chain product architect Oleg Andreev pointed to a comment from Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell suggesting that mining pools that say they are running Bitcoin Unlimited might not be.    Greg Maxwell points out that killing 50% of BU nodes did not lead to the same drop in BU-signalling hashrate. (1/3) pic.twitter.com/f9ZsMDaXQb        — Oleg Andreev (@oleganza) March 14, 2017      6. Cover-up?  Lopp, among others, pointed to one developer trying to cover up the crash.    Disappointed to see doctored image (left) in @GAndrewStone's post about a BU vulnerability. Doesn't even sum to 100% https://t.co/Byirt7eiCL pic.twitter.com/EArZwFSyOb        — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) March 14, 2017      Supporters respond  Bitcoin Unlimited’s supporters generally took the stance that the software is a newer version and that mistakes are inevitable.  7. Core issues  Bitcoin investor Roger Ver linked to a piece written by one of Bitcoin Unlimited’s developers about some of the bugs they've allegedly discovered in the Bitcoin Core codebase.    ""Normally, in Bitcoin Unlimited when we find a Core bug we just fix it and move on"" https://t.co/cqQaIm5FZJ        — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) March 14, 2017      8. Satoshi's bugs  Along those lines, Blockchain security and privacy engineer Kristov Atlas pointed out that bitcoin saw a number of bugs in its early days.    A few of the security vulns in the Satoshi-based over the years https://t.co/QwMbyebPqR        — Kristov Atlas (@kristovatlas) March 15, 2017        It’s unremarkable that Bitcoin Unlimited is going through some growing pains with bugs. 1/        — Kristov Atlas (@kristovatlas) March 15, 2017      Further, the exploit could encourage new programmers to join the Bitcoin Unlimited ranks and help out, he suggested.    I’ve already casually come across several people volunteering in last 24 hours to start reviewing the BU codebase for 1st time — good start.        — Kristov Atlas (@kristovatlas) March 15, 2017      9. What about the attacker?  To others, it seems like the attacker was getting off too easily. Whoever he or she is, deserves more blame, suggested Bitcoin Unlimited developer Tom Harding.  10. Strength in numbers  Many argued that the potential fragility of individual bitcoin implementations is a sign that there is strength in having more than one version of bitcoin.    @SatoshiLite It only proves we need multiple implementations. Having most of the network running a single implementation is reckless.        — dagur (@dagur) March 14, 2017      11. The ethereum approach  On a similar note, Ethereum Foundation blockchain consultant Hudson Jameson, a representative from ethereum, a blockchain known for its multiple implementations, even jumped in.    After the BU incident, should Bitcoin implement clients based on a spec rather than based on a reference client? https://t.co/FjgaIZkCtR        — Hudson Jameson (@hudsonjameson) March 15, 2017      12. Take a balanced view  Last, but not least, Abra's John Light urged for less divisive discussion on social media.    Once upon a time, Core caused a fork that lasted for several hours and cost $$$$$ before resolution. Stay humble in face of BU fuckups.        — John Light (@lightcoin) March 15, 2017        This was under different leadership, and a lot more is on the line now, but still, stones and glass houses and all.

Despite the expansion of China’s receipts market, the announcement comes at a time when small- to mid-sized firms are unable to fulfill demand.  According to the firms involved, the new alliance will benefit the sector by increasing the reliability and speed of transactions – another example of how blockchain technology could transform the traditional financial services.  At an event announcing the partnership, Cao Feng, a former senior IBM China official and the research firm's chairman, spoke broadly about the potential for blockchain, stating:  ""The application of blockchain technology in our society is far from reaching its potential.

As a result, domestic industry experts are looking for ways to contain these issues, a movement that the partnership is aimed to support.  The new group includes eight local banks – Ganzhou, Guiyang, Suzhou, Shizuishan, Jiutai Agricultural, Yaodu Agricultural and Langfang – along with government representatives from the cities of Shenzhen and Harbin, according to local media outlet Lei Phone.  The development further coincides with an increase in blockchain interest in China. Many large local firms are also developing blockchain-related products, including Alibaba's Ant Financial, JD Finance and HNA Group.

42399686,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyPIB,1489661126,"Illinois Joins R3, Unveils Expansive Blockchain Support Plan","While much of the US is working to piece together a patchwork of blockchain regulations, Illinois unveiled a sweeping plan yesterday that would see the state implement blockchain solutions across multiple government agencies.  Revealed at the DC Blockchain Summit, hosted by the Chamber of Digital Commerce, the multi-agency, public-private partnership aims to connect much of the state's infrastructure using a shared, distributed ledger.  Beyond just a play to streamline bureaucracy, the Illinois Blockchain Initiative's plan is designed to turn the native home of derivatives and the center of the US mercantile exchange into a fountainhead from which other states might also work to adopt blockchain.  In conversation with CoinDesk, the Illinois Blockchain Initiative’s blockchain business liaison, Jennifer O'Rourke, explained how her state government’s goals were both lofty, and simple.  O'Rourke said:  ""All roads go through Chicago, all railroad, airways, boat ways, everything. You can’t get anywhere without passing through Chicago, and that does have a meaningful consequence for supply chain and applications of blockchain.""  With future goals that include moving school degrees, health provider registries and energy credits to a blockchain, O'Rourke also announced that the State of Illinois had selected an industry partner.  O'Rourke revealed the first state agency will now join the R3 banking consortium, a distributed ledger effort powered by participation from more than 80 global banks.  Redoubled efforts  Further, the state revealed it has formed two of its own internal blockchain entities.  O’Rourke formally announced the creation of the Illinois Blockchain Legislative Task Force, previously reported by CoinDesk. The Task Force headed by state legislator, Michael Zalewski will be a 12-person group dedicated to researching the impact of blockchain on society.  Additionally, O'Rourke revealed the creation of an Illinois advisory committee that will focus on developing a strategy for implementing blockchain solutions. ""We recognize the importance of building out that economic development and ecosystem support,"" O’Rourke said.  But O’Rourke admitted bringing together so many government groups dedicated to blockchain wasn't an easy task. (The group of six government agencies behind the Illinois Blockchain Initiative includes the Illinois Department of Commerce, the state IT department, and two regulatory bodies.)  Far from being naturally aligned, O’Rourke said the trick to bringing everyone together was good, old-fashioned ""elbow grease"".  ""When we saw that there was a bite on the line,"" she said, ""we were ready to follow through with that immediately and bring them in. It was almost like detective work.""  While New York has Wall Street, and California has Silicon Valley, Chicago is known as the ""birthplace of derivatives"", and for being home to the two largest personal insurance companies in the US.  But those aren’t the only industries the initiative has in its sights. O’Rourke says she and her team are working closely with companies from both the supply chain and biotechnology industry.  ""They’re all actively thinking about it, they’re doing proofs of concept, they're doing pilots internally,"" said O’Rourke.  ""And when you think about who those major players are in those industries, a lot of them are located in Chicago.""  Blockchain education  In addition to the work that is focused on helping the government and businesses better understand how a distributed ledger can save time and increase transparency, O’Rourke revealed three educational ventures.  The first is the Chicago Blockchain Center — originally founded two years ago as the Chicago Bitcoin Center by Matthew Roszak of blockchain startup Bloq — which will now serve as a state educational facility.  Also, the State of Illinois will host a quarterly seminar series in partnership with cryptocurrency advocacy firm, Coin Center, to address concerns about banking digital currency, which has traditionally been a huge stumbling block for cryptocurrency-related startups.  ""We recognize that this is a very opaque space with a lot of questions around it,"" said O’Rourke. ""And we want to be part of the conversation to start getting to the bottom, or at least having a better dialogue about what this means.""  The Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) last year unveiled cryptocurrency guidance designed to make it one of the more friendly states to bitcoin and other cryptocurrency users.  In addition to the educational work with Coin Center, the Illinois Blockchain Initiative announced it has joined the Blockchain Education Network, and in partnership with the group, it plans to open up the state's Microsoft Azure blockchain sandbox for an upcoming blockchain hackathon.  Re-imagining government  That wasn't all though, O’Rourke also revealed details about five integrated government pilots, one of which is nearing completion.  Built in partnership with the Cook County Recorder of Deeds, the previously revealed proof of concept to facilitate the sale of property on a blockchain would signify the first blockchain real-estate deal in the US, she said.  Appropriately enough, it is exactly this kind of inter-government cooperation that blockchain might one day facilitate on a large scale, according to the Illinois department of finance's deputy director of strategy, Cab Morris, who also spoke with CoinDesk following the event.  Morris said that such government agencies around the US should look at what they do and ask what is at the ""core"" of their ""business model"", and how can a shared, immutable ledger improve that product?  ""To make government a little leaner, more efficient, automated,"" said Morris, ""but also more personalized and tailored to each specific citizen, I have come to think is the eventual opportunity that we can capture here.""  O’Rourke put it a different way:  ""I imagine a world in seven to 10 years where I never have to go to the DMV. That is exciting. That is really, really exciting and we are not there yet. We're not close to that yet. But the work that we’re doing is laying the foundation for that.""

42399674,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyP6N,1489654921,Alaskan Lawmakers Seek to License Bitcoin Businesses,"Lawmakers in Alaska are seeking regulatory changes that would require certain digital currency services that work in to state to obtain money transmission licenses.  House Bill 180  , introduced yesterday by state representative Kito Fansler, will potentially bring companies that exchange, store or transmit digital currencies like bitcoin on behalf of a customer under the state’s money transmission laws. If approved, relevant companies would need to apply for licensure with the state’s Banking and Securities Commission.  The proposed legislation includes an expanded definition of ""virtual currency"", including both decentralized and centralized varieties, and covering ""open-source, math-based, peer-to-peer- virtual currency"" in particular.  Notably, the bill is a follow-up to a previous effort to change state law to account for digital currencies. HB271, which contained much of the same language, failed in committee, months after being introduced in late January 2016.  The latest bill highlights the twin directions that lawmakers in different states have taken on the question of regulating digital currencies.  One the one side, led by states such as New York, licensure frameworks have emerged that include the technology under existing or updated statutes. In places like New Hampshire, by comparison, state officials have sought to create exemptions for digital currency traders.
