42428286,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL75Ph,1513809336,GMO Internet's Crypto Mining Facility Is Up and Running,"GMO Internet, a publicly listed IT firm in Japan, has officially launched its cryptocurrency mining operation.  The mining unit was previously unveiled in September, with a goal of going live with it in the first quarter of 2018. GMO has pursued a number of cryptocurrency-related business lines in the past year, including an exchange platform it opened in the spring and a bitcoin-focused payroll service unveiled earlier this month.  According to today's announcement, the new facility is based in northern Europe. And while the firm declined to name its exact location, GMO indicated that the mine will draw electricity from geothermal and hydropower sources. As reported earlier, the mining facility will be equipped with a computing power at 500 petahashes per second (PH/s).  ""The cryptocurrency mining business will use existing technology to mine from facilities (mining centers) in Northern Europe. GMO Internet will increase the size of the operation in phases, expanding the business,"" GMO said in its statement.  The announcement also confirms previously suggested plans to develop a cloud mining service, through which it would sell excess hashing power and the associated rewards (when a new block is added to a blockchain by a miner, that miner receives new coins in return) to consumers.  GMO also appears to be taking a bullish approach to its mining business in the long-term.  For example, the publicly traded firm plans to begin upgrading its chips in the first half of next year. Supporting that effort is research into new mining chips being developed with as-yet-to-be-revealed partners.  Pending the outcome of that process, GMO indicated that it would move to begin selling mining hardware.  ""After the company has gained a certain level of operational experience, it will work on initiatives including [the] provision of a cloud mining service and selling next-generation mining boards equipped with mining chips,"" the firm said in the statement.

42428282,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL75Dh,1513801759,Coinbase's Bitcoin Cash Market Is Back Online,"GDAX, the digital asset exchange run by Coinbase, has resumed trading of bitcoin cash hours after its initial – and tumultuous – effort to launch a market for the breakaway cryptocurrency.  Trading was halted abruptly last night after bitcoin cash, which broke away from the main bitcoin blockchain last month, was listed on GDAX. In the few minutes that trading was accessible, the price shot as high as $9,500, a level that represented a large premium over other exchanges.  Starting at 9 a.m. PST today, GDAX began allowing access to its bitcoin cash market once again, holding it in a post-only mode (in which users could submit asks and bids without having them executed) for the two hours that followed.  At 11 a.m. PST, trading resumed, with those initial buy orders above $4,000 quickly filled. According to GDAX data, 11,591 BCH – an amount worth roughly $39 million – was exchanged in the first 15 minutes of trading alone.  Smooth trading aside, the situation sparked controversy following allegations that insider trading may have occurred ahead of the BCH market launch on Coinbase.  In a statement earlier today, CEO Brian Armstrong wrote that the company would investigate whether any employees had traded on the pre-public news.  ""Given the price increase in the hours leading up the announcement, we will be conducting an investigation into this matter,"" he said.  The move to halt trading also came days after Coinbase (which operates GDAX) paused buys and sells for ether and litecoin amid a period of heavy activity on the site.  As of press time, BCH is trading at roughly $3,270 on GDAX, compared to $3,353 on Bitfinex and $4,251 on South Korea-based Bithumb.  And while GDAX appears to be out of the woods (for now) on the bitcoin cash side, a new update to the parent company's status page indicates that customers of the flagship service could experience delays on their bank wires.  ""Wire deposits and withdrawals may be delayed by up to 5 business days. Rejected [and] reversed wires will now be processed within 48 business hours,"" Coinbase wrote on the page.

""I think cryptocurrency is a reflection of the disaster of the monetary dollar system,"" he told CNBC in an interview today. Specifically, Paul cited an excessive amount of credit created through the process of quantitative easing – by which central banks buy government debt and other financial assets in an effort to expand lending and boost the market – as at least partially responsible for the rise in cryptocurrencies.  He went on to say:  ""I think if you had not had the QEs, and the massive amount of inflation, and places looking for the easing dollars to go, you might still have the cryptocurrencies. But I don't think you would have this exponential bubble that is going on.""  The former U.S. Representative's comments are perhaps unsurprising, given that Paul – who has also waged unsuccessful bids for the presidency – has come out largely in favor of cryptocurrencies in the past.  In October, Paul said that while he doesn't consider bitcoin to be a form of real money, he nonetheless believes the U.S. government should limit how it regulates activities involving the tech.  ""If people want to use it, the government should stay out of it,"" Paul told TheStreet at the time.  And earlier this month, the former congressman started an online poll on Twitter asking whether people – if given the option of taking a gift worth $10,000 they had to hold on to for a period of time – would take bitcoin, gold or dollars. Over half of the respondents showed support for bitcoin.

42428277,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL757h,1513787418,Cryptocurrency Hedge Fund Hit With Class Action Lawsuit,"Monkey Capital, a Delaware-based company seeking to create a decentralized hedge fund, has been hit with a class action lawsuit alleging a fraudulent issuance of securities.  The claim, filed in the U.S. District Court in Florida, represents five plaintiffs who invested cryptocurrency now valued at $3.8 million into the project ahead of a proposed token sale last July that was to help build the Monkey Capital Market – an envisaged decentralized hedge fund and private crypto exchange.  The investors purchased cryptocurrency options called ""coevals"" that were to be later used to purchase tokens called Monkey Coins at a valuation premium in a forthcoming token sale.  However, after the sale was delayed, Monkey Capital's fundraising website disappeared altogether in early August, when the sale was scheduled to resume. It has yet to reappear.  The suit alleges that Daniel Harrison, founder of Monkey Capital and an heir to Harrison & Sons – a U.K.-based printing house – then captured the proceeds via a network of pass-through companies and exchanged them for crypto or fiat currency.  ""In other words, there never was, and may never be, a Monkey Capital Market,"" the filing states, while arguing that the pre-sale amounted to an unregistered securities offering that was marketed through the use of deceptive and misleading statements and advertising.  It asserts:  “Monkey Capital promoted that through its 'all-star management team' ... it would be operating a decentralized hedge fund to invest in items such as SpaceX supply contracts and hostile public company takeovers and blockchain systems while simultaneously speculating on large blocks of cryptocurrency.""  In addition, Monkey Capital's original white paper – which appears to have been rescinded along with its fundraising website – detailed how its scheme could create ""perpetuated wealth creation"" for token holders and returns as high as 40 percent per year.  The class action, filed by David Silver, partner at SilverMiller in south Florida, contends that the investors had clearly bought into a common enterprise with an expectation to profit from the efforts of others – checking many of the boxes of the Howey test, a common metric for determining if an offering constitutes an investment contract.  ""Daniel Harrison and Monkey Capital are a damning indictment of what is wrong with the ICO market and the unregulated sales of securities,"" Silver told CoinDesk.  In emailed comments to CoinDesk, Harrison characterized the lawsuit as one driven by ""a deep, irrational personal vendetta,"" stating that ""the content of the filing therefore amounts to baseless heresay[sic].""  ""What the individuals who submitted this ridiculous filing have done today will in time turn out to be a course of action that they really regret taking,"" he added.

42428288,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL75Th,1513783234,ICE Exchange Unit Seeks to List Bitcoin Futures ETFs,"NYSE Arca has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a proposed rule change that would allow for the listing of two exchange-traded funds tied to bitcoin futures.  Public records  dated Dec. 19 show that the company wants to list two ETFs – the ProShares Bitcoin ETF and the ProShares Short ETF – that were originally proposed in September. According to the document, NYSE Arca, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), submitted the proposed rule change on Dec. 4.  As indicated in the filing, the ETFs would track two recently launched futures contracts, released in the past week and a half by Cboe and, later, CME Group.  ""According to the Registration Statement, the investment objective of the Fund is to seek results (before fees and expenses) that, both for a single day and over time, correspond to the performance of lead month bitcoin futures contracts listed and traded on either [Cboe] or [CME],"" the company wrote.  The filing is a notable one, given the recent momentum behind financial products connected to the cryptocurrency market. While the past few months have seen several filings with the SEC related to cryptocurrency-tied ETFs, NYSE Arca's submission suggests that at least some of those proposed products are entering the agency's formal approval stage.  NYSE Arca previously sought to list an ETF from startup SolidX, but the SEC denied the proposed rule change in March of this year.  That move closely followed the rejection of another ETF proposed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, though in that case, the SEC has since begun a review of that decision following a request from the Bats BZX exchange.

42428296,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL75fh,1513780926,Waiting Game: Bitcoin Cash at Record High Ahead of Coinbase Relaunch,"Bitcoin cash is resurgent today, despite some controversy over the cryptocurrency's listing on the Coinbase exchange.  As per data source CoinMarketCap, the world's third-largest cryptocurrency by market value is up 64 percent over the last 24 hours, and set a lifetime high of $3,816 soon before press time. That follows a previous high of $3,813 set around 02:00 UTC.  Notably, the price of the cryptocurrency rose sharply soon before Coinbase announced support for bitcoin cash (BCH) transactions on its platform yesterday. However, trading in BCH was quickly suspended and existing orders were canceled due to claimed ""significant volatility.""  Meanwhile, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has responded to allegations of insider trading over the timing of the price rise by stating that the company will be conducting an investigation into the matter and will take appropriate legal action if employees or contractors are found guilty.  Following the announcement, BCH made a retreat from the record highs, however it is always hard to make any definite link with news flow and the move looks more like a healthy technical pullback.  With BCH/USD trading set to resume today on Coinbase's GDAX trading platform, BCH may soon be looking at fresh record prices.  Bitcoin cash  View  The base looks to have shifted higher to $2,400. The ascending 5-day and 10-day MAs are likely to ensure that dips are short-lived. As a result, prices could extend the rally to $4,055 (127.2 percent Fibonacci extension).  Only two consecutive day-end closes below $2,400 would abort the bullish view.  The outlook for BCH/BTC also remains bullish.  BCH/BTC chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  A bullish rising channel breakout and a sharp rise to BTC of 0.2298 yesterday – the highest level since Nov. 13.  The RSI shows room for another leg higher in BCH/BTC.  The 5-day and 10-day MAs are curled up in favor of the bulls.  View  Clearly, the pair looks set to topple the Nov. 13 high of BTC 0.2561.  However, the sharp retreat from BTC 0.2298 to BTC 0.1866 indicates short-term bull market exhaustion. Hence, a sideways action around BTC 0.18 cannot be ruled out.  Only a close (as per UTC) below BTC 0.09 (Dec. 16 low) would abort the bullish view.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.

Writing in a Reddit post this morning, developer Charlie Lee explained he no longer wants to fend off allegations his remarks about litecoin's price are being done for his personal enrichment, and that he saw the sale as the best way to ensure transparency over his actions.  Lee wrote:  ""Some people even think I short LTC! So in a sense, it is conflict of interest for me to hold LTC and tweet about it because I have so much influence.""  While he claimed to ""always refrained"" from buying and selling litecoin close to ""major tweets,"" his actions could be perceived as aimed to boost his own personal wealth ""above the success of litecoin and crypto-currency in general,"" Lee explained.  As a result, Lee said has sold off or donated his litecoin holdings in recent days, barring a few physical litecoins being kept as ""collectibles."" Lee added that the amount of litecoin he sold was ""a small percentage"" of the cryptocurrency's global trading volume.  Now, the seventh largest coin by market valuation, litecoin was formed via a fork of bitcoin back in 2011, and often previously referred to as the ""silver to bitcoin's gold."" An employee of Google at the time, Lee envisioned litecoin as a cryptocurrency that would offer merchants faster transaction times.  Of late, litecoin has seen a recent resurgence in price as Lee proposed an ambitious technical roadmap, including adopting the scaling solution Segregated Witness originally planned for bitcoin. At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading at around $334, having achieved a new all-time high of $375.29 just yesterday.

The news follows widespread social media accusations that suggest employees may have moved to tip off others in advance of the news. As profiled by CoinDesk, bitcoin cash set a new record of $2,500 earlier in the day's trading, rising 21 percent by the early morning hours before hitting an all-time high above $3,700.  In a blog post, CEO Brian Armstrong addressed allegations head on, making public an exchange policy indicating that employees are barred from trading ahead of listings that may influence cryptocurrency markets.  Armstrong wrote:  ""Given the price increase in the hours leading up the announcement, we will be conducting an investigation into this matter. If we find evidence of any employee or contractor violating our policies — directly or indirectly — I will not hesitate to terminate the employee immediately and take appropriate legal action.""  It's notably not the first time that price movements have appeared to anticipate moves by the exchange to list new cryptocurrencies.  Ahead of its Aug. 23, 2016 listing of litecoin, for example, prices of the cryptocurrency began rising at least a day in advance, according to data from Coinmarketcap. Coinbase lists only four assets on its GDAX exchange, offering order books for bitcoin, ether, litecoin and bitcoin cash.  Still the move to list bitcoin cash was unique, as it effectively gave all customers of Coinbase's GDAX exchange an amount of bitcoin cash equal to the amount of bitcoin they held on the exchange at the time the new cryptocurrency network was created. Just minutes after making funds available, however, the future was abruptly pulled.  Coinbase has indicated it will seek to relaunch bitcoin cash trading later today.

42428295,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL75dh,1513772742,How Low Can Bitcoin Go? Charts Hint $11k in Play,"Bitcoin is increasingly looking topped-out as excitement fades over the recent launch of the first futures products to focus on the cryptocurrency.  As per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, the cryptocurrency was last seen trading at $17,000, down from the record high of $19,783 set on Dec. 17. Overall, bitcoin has depreciated by 4 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data source CoinMarketCap, but it's perhaps the movement behind that figure that's most notable.  Bitcoin's 24-hour trading volume has jumped above $19 billion – its highest since Dec. 8. The high volume sell-off indicates strong hands are at play and price weakness could extend over the coming weekend.  Apparently driving the price drop is the rotation of money out of bitcoin (BTC) and into alternatives such as bitcoin cash (BCH) – as shown by the massive gains in the BCH/BTC pair in the run-up to Coinbase's decision to list the cryptocurrency on its exchange platform.  The question now is, how low can bitcoin go?  The price chart analysis indicates the sell-off could run out of steam around $11,000 levels.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart (price as per Coinbase) shows:  Yesterday's weak close confirmed a hanging man bearish reversal pattern and bearish price RSI divergence.  The sharp drop to $14,000 today strengthens the argument that a short-term top is in place at $19,891.99.  Historical data  shows that previous bouts of correction bottomed-out near 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. Accordingly, the current pullback could run out of steam around $11,000.  Bitcoin chart (prices as per Bitstamp)  The use of a harmonic price pattern also identifies the area near $11,000 as a potential reversal zone, with the potential bullish reversal point being $11,280.  A cypher pattern is a part of the harmonic trading methodology that utilizes the recognition of specific price patterns and the alignment of exact Fibonacci ratios to determine a highly probable reversal point.  Cypher is characterized by:  AB= 0.382 to 0.618 retracement of the XA swing leg;  BC= extend to minimum 1.272 and maximum 1.414 of the XA swing leg  CD= retrace to 0.786 of the XC swing leg  D = reversal point  View  BTC seems to have topped out near $20,000 for the short-term.  The area around $11,000 could act as a strong support zone or a reversal point as suggested by the cypher pattern.  Bullish scenario - A close (as per UTC) today above the 5-day MA of $18,680 would add credence to the sharp recovery from the intraday low of $14,000 (prices as per Coinbase) and could yield a move above $20,000.

In a survey published yesterday by the U.K.-based Center for Macroeconomics, 100 prominent European university economists were asked for their thoughts regarding the recent market growth of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.  According to the results from the 50 respondents – in response to the question ""Do you agree that cryptocurrencies are currently a threat to the stability of the financial system, or can be expected to become a threat in the next couple of years?"" – nearly 50 percent of the respondents said they ""disagree,"" while another 25 percent ""strongly disagree.""  Some economist argued that, even with a near-$300 billion market capitalization, bitcoin is still trivial compared to the overall financial market.  For example, Michael McMahon, professor in economics from the University of Oxford, was quoted as saying:  ""Cryptocurrencies are still too small and lacking in widespread ownership, especially among large investment groups, to be a serious risk to the overall financial system.""  Similarly, Ethan Ilzetzki, assistant professor from the Economics Department Centre for Macroeconomics at London School of Economics, called bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ""a toy for a very narrow segment of investors."" Further, they are ""detached"" from the financial system and the ""real economy,"" he said.  While not recognizing bitcoin as a threat, a majority of the respondents still expressed concerns around the role of bitcoin and its challenge to traditional central bank-issued currencies. In fact, 61 percent of the interviewees either ""agree"" or ""strongly agree"" that regulatory oversight of cryptocurrencies needs to be increased.  For instance, Sylvester Eijffinger, professor of financial economics at Tilburg University, argued that cryptocurrencies are ""undermining the monopoly of money creation by the central banks and [leading to] the ineffectiveness of conventional and unconventional monetary policy.""  However, the European Central Bank takes a somewhat different view on bitcoin. Addressing the European Parliament late in November, the president of the ECB, Mario Draghi, stated that digital currencies are ""not yet something that could constitute a risk for central banks.""

42428294,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL75bh,1513760408,The 2017 Tapscott Blockchain Prediction Scorecard,"Don Tapscott is the co-founder of The Blockchain Research Institute. He has authored over 15 books, including ""Blockchain Revolution,"" published in May 2016 by Portfolio.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      Notwithstanding our admonition in ""Blockchain Revolution"" that ""the future is not something to be predicted but something to be achieved,"" a year ago my son Alex Tapscott and I made some predictions for 2017.  A key theme was the issue of governance. As we wrote in our submission for CoinDesk's 2016 in Review, ""In 2017, we need to get our act together. Decentralization is critical to this technology and to the future of civilization. But decentralization does not mean disorganization. So, we resolve to focus on governance in the new year.""  We also said that, ""Investment (in proprietary blockchains) will continue in 2017, but the pendulum will swing back somewhat to the public blockchain space. If the bitcoin community can get its act together and solve some basic governance issues (like scaling), investors will again see it as an attractive play – and with good reason. Bitcoin is still the biggest, most secure, most liquid blockchain to date.""  ""Bitcoin bad, blockchain good"" was heard a lot less in 2017 than in 2016. And for good reason. Business-leaders awoke to the reality that the most ground-breaking innovation in this industry is happening in the permissionless open-source blockchain world, including in bitcoin, but also ethereum, Cosmos, Tezos, Eos and other new platforms. As for bitcoin, there were improvements in governance, and a temporary resolution of the scaling debate acted as one of a few big catalysts enabling bitcoin to resume its upward trajectory.  Prediction: ""Bitcoin will hit $2,000 (that's right: one bitcoin will be worth $2,000). Ethereum will not collapse, post-DAO, but will become a dominant platform for new apps and new business models.""  What happened: We were ridiculed for forecasting that bitcoin would triple in value. ""You guys are nuts,"" was a popular tweet.  However, only in the wild world of cryptocurrencies can you set a one-year price target implying a 200 percent return, and miss the mark by a factor of nearly 10! As for ethereum, the fork happened and ethereum kept on chugging away, became the de-facto platform for the ICO boom that launched a thousand dapps, from distributed file storage and prediction markets to collectible kittens.  Prediction: ""A major central bank will live test a digital fiat currency and it will work, very well, leading to broader adoption.""  What happened: While some central banks did explore and test the concept of a digital fiat currency, none was able to take the next step and implement it in production and at scale. Indeed, most central bank chatter in 2017 was about bitcoin-mania, with many (India, France, Russia, China, New Zealand, etc.) calling it a speculative asset and some even a bubble.  We think this analysis misses the mark. To be sure, bitcoin is hot, but its bigger importance is what it represents: An emerging alternative to central-bank-issued currencies, governed not by a centralized authority but by a combination of math, consensus and clever code. Central bank governors would be wise to better understand what bitcoin represents and what seismic economic and social shifts are driving it, rather than just its price (the same too could be said for all the HODLers out there).  Perhaps the most remarkable response was from Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, who said in a speech in February that that cryptocurrencies could, among other things, improve financial stability, inclusion and provide better value than traditional fiat currencies, particularly in less developed countries and warned central bankers to ignore them at their peril  Prediction: ""Large banks will begin shifting large amounts of over-the-counter (OTC) transactions to real-time settlement on private distributed ledgers. Look for JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Santander to lead the charge.""  What happened: Even though the chief executive officer of JPMorgan, Jamie Dimon, asserted that bitcoin is a ""fraud,"" JPMorgan is one of the most active and innovative banks in this area. It partnered with zcash, a distributed and anonymous cryptocurrency network, to pioneer anonymous transactions in other financial assets like stocks and bonds. It uses the awkwardly named but potentially transformational technology called zk-snarks. JPMorgan was also a co-founder of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, with more than 100 other big firms.  As the sun set on 2017, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) announced that securities trading would migrate to a blockchain infrastructure being developed by Digital Asset (run by Blythe Masters). Expect more to follow. As for Jamie Dimon, he doth protest too much.  Prediction: ""Incumbent companies in every industry will begin developing a blockchain strategy, hiring key IT talent and launching pilots – for sure, insurers, healthcare providers, music labels, defense contractors and others.""  What happened: Yes! This happened. Our Blockchain Research Institute is documenting this development in 70 projects in 10 industry sectors.  Prediction: ""A new round of startups will enter this space in virtually every industry, particularly a new class of platform and middleware companies. From what we've seen, the innovation may well be stunning.""  What happened: Check!  Prediction: ""The crisis of legitimacy of democracy (as evidence by the recent U.S. election) will accelerate the development and sandboxing of new e-voting systems and new platforms for accountable democracy emphasizing the use of smart contracts.""  What happened: As with the internet's first era, governments are slow to embrace change. There is experimentation with blockchain for improving operations and some governments (such as Dubai, Estonia, Georgia) are doing large deployments. But when it comes to building new models of democracy based on transparency, accountability, public deliberation and active citizenship through blockchain e-voting, smart votes, and new collaborative tools, most politicians are oblivious.  It is no surprise that trust in governments continues to plummet. In the U.S., we see tax changes favoring wealthy individuals and large corporations. The rollback of healthcare, increasing mass gun violence, attacks on consumer and environmental laws, and looming cuts to social services, will undermine prosperity for the vast majority of citizens. Opposition candidates in the 2018 mid-terms must demonstrate that technology can counter fake news, thwart the voter suppression of 2016 and rebuild trust for the digital age.  Prediction: ""'Blockchain Revolution' will continue to be a global best-seller, in multiple languages, and make the New York Times non-fiction list.""  What happened: Well, we didn’t make the NYT non-fiction list (yet), but the book is still the best-selling book on blockchain ever, and already translated into over a dozen languages. The book has led to the launch of the Blockchain Research Institute. It is conducting the definitive investigation into the strategic issues in blockchain. The multi-million program includes 70 projects across 10 industry verticals, including government as well as projects on how blockchain changes the way we manage our companies.

The San Francisco-based company has released an open-source compiler that translates between Ivy, Chain's own high-level smart contract language, and Bitcoin Script, the low-level programming language of the world's first and largest blockchain.  According to Chain's latest blog post, Ivy aims to help developers ""write custom, SegWit-compatible bitcoin addresses that enforce arbitrary combinations of conditions supported by the bitcoin protocol, including signature checks, hash commitments, and timelocks.""  As reported previously, Ivy was introduced in a public demo in December 2016.  Language limitations  While ethereum's advanced smart contract functionality is a key feature that differentiates it from bitcoin, the latter does allow developers to write smart contracts using Bitcoin Script.  Yet, the limitations of the underlying virtual machine have made the language difficult to write in.  ""Bitcoin Script development is considered somewhat esoteric,"" Chain's blog post reads.  However, it is worth noting that the Ivy language currently is more for educational and research purposes as it is still an untested prototype software.

42428291,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL75Xh,1513746013,Bring on the FUD: 2017 Was The Year Bitcoin Became Anti-Fragile,"Jimmy Song is a bitcoin developer, an instructor for Dev++ and the owner-operator of his own in-depth technical bitcoin seminar called Programming Blockchain.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      As bitcoin approaches $20,000, continuing to create new millionaires along the way, it's easy to deceive ourselves and think that we could all see this coming. It's hard to remember now, but the mood entering 2017 was a far cry from the optimism that we see in the bitcoin community after something like a 20x price rise.  SegWit had not yet activated. The New York Agreement, UASF, bitcoin cash, let alone bitcoin gold, were not in existence. The community was very much struggling to figure out a way forward on its technical roadmap and many people were arguing about what to do and complaining about the toxic atmosphere. OK, maybe some things haven't changed, but still, the community at the beginning of the year was very different than where we are now.  In this review of 2017, I'll be focusing on what we learned about bitcoin, how we got to the euphoria that we have now and what this all means going forward.  Phase 1 - Uncertainty  The year began with a lot of uncertainty. Only about 30 percent of miners were signaling for SegWit, while Bitcoin Unlimited, a rival software program attracted 35 percent support. Nothing looked imminent regarding scaling. Many developers, users and businesses were getting frustrated at the lack of progress, and there were dire warnings about how a fork like Bitcoin Unlimited would completely ruin bitcoin.  Yet despite all that, bitcoin entered the year on an upswing. Bitcoin passed $1,000 for the first time since 2013, and there was a real sense that the bear market had turned the corner.  This would not be the first time that uncertainty and price rises would coincide in 2017, and indeed the two being correlated is a major learning for the community this year.  The uncertainty kicked into high gear as ""extension blocks,"" UASF and NYA all made their way to the stage in the first half of the year. There was a cat-and-mouse game of different bitcoin factions making threats, some credible, some not, to get what they wanted. The first half of the year was a time of crazy new developments almost on a daily basis.  Would Bitcoin split? Could bitcoin possibly survive a hard fork? Are people going to be scared off from buying bitcoin?  Instead of a price decline, we saw during the Jan-June time frame that the price actually rose 3x despite the threats of forks and ""agreements"" made for the benefit of those who signed it.  We saw during this period that bitcoin was not like other assets. Uncertainty around a company typically depresses its price. Uncertainty around bitcoin seemed to increase it. What was happening? Why was uncertainty correlated to a higher price?  Phase 2 - Fear  The New York Agreement at the end of May and the subsequent 3 months leading up to August 1st were a time of a lot of fear in the bitcoin community. Many, including myself, were concerned that bitcoin would die from brand confusion, split communities and decreased network effect. Many saw the inevitable divorce between the ""big blockers"" and ""small blockers"" as a mortal blow waiting to be delivered.  There was some relief when the NYA managed to lock in Segwit on the network through BIP91. The community was soon blindsided by Bitcoin Cash, though, which announced its intentions to fork very soon after. August 1st would become the day that bitcoin would change forever.  Going into August 1st, many thought that a hard fork would be a terrible thing for bitcoin in general. There would be two different bitcoins, two different communities, a split network effect and many other things. Many were expecting price to adjust to those realities and crater to much lower levels. Instead, what we saw was the start of a bull run, the likes of which we haven't seen since 2013.  The price the day before the hard fork was around $2,700. The next week, bitcoin rose to $3,700 and bitcoin cash surprisingly had value that wasn't zero. What was going on? How did both forks end up greater than the sum before the fork? Such math seems self-evident now, but this was not the predicted outcome and most thought that forks would reduce the overall value, not gain.  Again, we saw during this period that bitcoin was not like other assets. Bitcoin gained from social/technical/economic disorder. In other words, bitcoin is anti-fragile.  Phase 3 - Confidence  Despite the relative peacefulness of the hard fork on August 1, there was another fork ahead that was sure to be more contentious – the Segwit2x hard fork scheduled for three months after Segwit activation. The community had learned a bit about hard forks by then and there was less consternation about the harm a split there would cause.  But, Segwit2x turned out to be a disaster and the backers of the agreement ended up abandoning the effort a week before its scheduled fork. The code that was to create the split didn't work, and it was obvious that the effort simply lacked the requisite development power to make it a success.  Why?  We discovered this year that developers give the bitcoin network technological anti-fragility. Every time there is a disordering event like the bitcoin cash hard fork, developers in the entire Bitcoin ecosystem are forced to deal with it. More software is written, more attack cases are handled, the software gets better. As a result, the entire bitcoin ecosystem, not just the part the developer is working on, gets better.  Bitcoin is technologically anti-fragile because the developers have the ability to react and strengthen the network anytime vulnerabilities are found.  We also discovered this year that HODLers give the bitcoin network economic anti-fragility. HODLers will hold through the fear and uncertainty. There is no panic selling with this group. They've been through a three-year bear market. It's not easy to shake their confidence in what bitcoin can do. The mainstream media can warn us about bubbles, the technologists can warn us about how it can't scale, even core developers can warn us about how we're doomed.  Holders. Don't. Care. They believe in bitcoin. They aren't shaken by a few warnings and rely on bitcoin as sound money.  Lastly, we discovered this year that the bitcoin community gives the bitcoin network social anti-fragility. The community will not bow to the interests of businesses. The community will punish people and businesses that it thinks are acting not in its interest. Many people and companies have been punished and have suffered as a result of the community's enforcement of what it thinks is good for bitcoin.  The adversarial network has developed a moral standard for what good behavior is and bad behavior is punished and prevented.  Conclusion  Bitcoin continues to grow and increase in price for a reason. 2017 was the year that people started to see real evidence that bitcoin is not something that can be stopped. Many other reviewers seem to be disappointed at how bitcoin didn't do X, Y or Z. I see the fact that it not just survived, but thrived as evidence that their pet feature or development isn't that important.  So what does this mean for 2018? We can expect more fear and uncertainty going forward. Certainly, the people HODLing now are probably pretty different in composition than earlier this year. Perhaps the community has fragilized a bit through all these noobs that haven't been through a bear market or a 70 percent correction.  What's certain is that bitcoin is unpredictable and bitcoin will grow in unexpected ways. I can only hope that as much fear and uncertainty await us in 2018.

42428293,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL75Zh,1513737657,Coinbase Halts Bitcoin Cash Trading Abruptly After Launch,"Shortly after the sudden news it would add support for the cryptocurrency bitcoin cash, U.S. exchange startup Coinbase has already moved to disable trading of its newest asset.  Announced today via a blog post to users, the decision to add the cryptocurrency, the third-largest by market capitalization, comes months after developers backing the effort cloned the bitcoin blockchain, effectively creating a competing network that claimed to enable a greater volume of transactions.  Using a mechanism called a hard fork, however, the project created unique complications for exchanges, as by copying bitcoin's ledger at the time of the split, Coinbase users who held bitcoin were effectively owners of bitcoin cash as well.  As such, a sudden influx of users armed with capital appears to have put a strain on the exchange, the most well-capitalized in the U.S. market.  At press time, buying and selling of bitcoin cash were disabled on the platform, with the last quoted price listed at nearly $9,000, more than $6,000 above the market price of $2,900, according to data provider CoinMarketCap.  According to the exchange's official status blog, trading was disabled after about four minutes after it began. Trading went live at 17:20 PST and was pulled back to post-only mode at 17:24, records show.  ""All BCH books will enter cancel-only mode, and all existing orders will be cleared. While in cancel-only mode, no new orders will be accepted. We will post an update shortly,"" the exchange wrote at 18:30 PST, and later tweeted.  The service outage does not appear to have affected either the exchange's other assets or its Coinbase brokerage service, which allows users to buy and sell bitcoin, ether and litecoin.  Representatives for Coinbase did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.

42428287,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL75Nh,1513735255,$300 Million Lockup: Storj Clarifies Token Economics in Surprise Reveal,"One of the oldest and most notable token projects is taking steps to offer its community clarity on how it manages the funds it holds in its own network.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the blockchain-based file storage network Storj is announcing it will lock-up 245 million tokens it has in reserve (valued at more than $300 million at press time) for another six months. Yet apart from offering clarity to investors, the move effectively makes Storj, which announced in May it would be creating 500 million tokens on ethereum – 70 million which it sold in a public – an outlier in the unwieldy and opaque world of crypto-economics.  The announcement highlights what's a less commonly acknowledged issue – that many investors simply don't have clarity on the dates when the firms associated with a token's development may be able to access their liquidity.  For example, onstage at Token Summit II in December, Ryan Selkis, entrepreneur-in-residence at ConsenSys, detailed several unclear token distribution schedules from well-known blockchain projects. In his mind, token issuers need to be far more open with those schedules, since the rate at which tokens are launched could have significant impacts on other buyers.  Storj's reserve tokens were scheduled to be released on Dec. 20, but according to executives at the company, holding those reserves until a clearer picture of the project's timeline can be formulated will lead to increased stability.  While clarity is hard to come by, market participants understand what a problem this secrecy in distribution could be.  ""You've got these quasi-fiduciaries selling quasi-securities over a quasi-vesting period,"" Selkis said.  Storj chief financial officer, Matthew May, echoed that sentiment, telling CoinDesk:  ""Since these coin offerings are so new, there's a real need to be transparent. There's some market makers out there trying to manipulate these coins.""  Why delay?  For some, this move could seem strange, since releasing the tokens would give Storj access to a significant sum of money that it could use to hire more employees and pursue more partnerships.  But according to Philip Hutchins, chief technology officer at Storj, the company has all the funds it will need for the next six months. And that will signal to its community that the company is stable and here for the long term, he said.  ""Software changes, right? Over time we are learning how the cadence of the token changes,"" Hutchins said. ""We're taking a little bit longer to get a better idea of what that flow looks like.""  Before the end of the new lock-up period, Storj will announce a more detailed token distribution plan for its reserve, which will likely include an additional lock-up of a large portion of the pool.  And that plan is specifically geared towards making the macroeconomics of the token easier to follow (something that has become increasingly difficult with the dramatic growth in cryptocurrency prices over the past few months).  ""We are responding to that confusion with as much transparency as possible,"" Hutchins said.  The company plans on making several hires over the next few months to help it think through token economics in more detail.  While some believe the best course of action is just to release all the tokens as soon as possible all at once, the thinking among the executives is to instead release them in increments. Whether those increments should be monthly or semi-annually remains to be determined, but all options remain on the table.  Hutchins added:  ""Generally, the consensus is they don't want to have large chunks of tokens looming out there without any idea of what's going to be done with them.""  Price points  What could be part of the reason Storj is holding back the release of new tokens is to not affect the price of those currently on the market. The team acknowledges that a steadily increasing token price has been beneficial. The storj token has jumped from $0.46 to $1.41 in three months, according to data provider CoinMarketCap.  ""If you have one of the top cryptocurrencies ... that will bring attention to what we're doing in our project,"" May said. ""We can't lose sight that that's a contributing factor.""  And with that, more of the token, which is paid out to network participants that free up encrypted storage on their devices, is maybe not needed just yet.  Although the network has grown substantially in recent months. The network recently reached 20 petabytes in total storage, up from five petabytes two months before, according to a spokesperson for Storj.  Not a bad amount, since one petabyte is equal to 13.3 years of HD video, according to data storage provider, Mozy.  While Storj has locked-up its reserve tokens, more than 10 million tokens that were sold during the token sale will have vested tomorrow and will be released. Full details about where the total 500 million tokens are at now can be found in the company's token sale wrap-up blog post.  Circling back to Storj's interest in getting the economics of the system just right, May concluded:  ""Our ultimate goal and laser focus internally is to build a really beautiful, decent storage platform, and the interesting thing about the tokens is we are trying to make the best possible decisions about the token to create some stability to enable that platform.""
