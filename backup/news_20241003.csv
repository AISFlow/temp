The analyst, which has been so big on a looming altseason since the beginning of the year, has revealed a bearish outlook for Bitcoin and even Ethereum (king of altcoins) in the short term. Known for his sometimes controversial and often contrarian predictions, Capo returned just as the market experienced a notable correction in October, sharing his bearish outlook for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. His latest prediction is that Ethereum could plummet as low as $1,800 before seeing any substantial recovery. ETH’s Predicted Decline Ethereum has already dropped by 10% in the past seven days and is currently trading around around $2,330, but according to Capo, this decline could worsen. He predicted that ETH might fall further into the $1,800 to $2,000 range, which is a possible 23% dip from its current price, before eventually rebounding. However, he believes an altcoin season will still materialize. Related Reading: Still Holding Your Hamster Kombat Tokens? You Might Be In For A Nice Surprise Soon Quick update: There’s a possibility of one last shakeout, with $BTC testing the $48k-50k zone and $ETH $1.8k-2k, before the real altseason begins. If that happens, I’ll be adding more to my altcoin bags. https://t.co/sx6u8wPNrK — il Capo Of Crypto (@CryptoCapo_) October 2, 2024 Capo’s track record of analysis since the beginning of the year shows a consistent belief in the upcoming dominance of altcoins. Throughout 2024, he has repeatedly emphasized the potential for altcoins, particularly Ethereum, to outperform Bitcoin as profits generated from BTC flow into smaller assets. However, the altcoin season has yet to materialize, and Bitcoin has continued to dominate the crypto investment scene. Time To Go Long On Ethereum? It’s worth noting that Crypto Capo’s predictions often have a certain lore attached to them. There is a running joke among some investors that whenever Capo makes a prediction, the market tends to do the opposite. This goes as far back as his prediction of Bitcoin falling to $12,000 last year, but the crypto eventually broke past resistance levels. Now, with Capo predicting the possibility of continued decline for Ethereum and Bitcoin amid October’s bullish market sentiment (often dubbed “Uptober”), it raises the question from many investors if his bearish call is far-fetched. Related Reading: Dogecoin At $10 Thesis: What Each Breakout Cycle Says About The DOGE Price Only time will tell if the market plays out according to Capo’s analysis. However, given the current inflow of investments and the crypto market, which has mostly rallied in October, it wouldn’t be surprising if Ethereum rebounds rather than experiences the significant drop Capo is forecasting. Naturally, many savvy whales and traders have seen the current decline as an opportunity to “go long” and accumulate more Ethereum in expectation of the resumption of inflows. This sentiment is reflected through the US Spot Ethereum ETFs, which witnessed $14.45 million in inflows yesterday despite the price correction. Interestingly, it is important to note that Capo’s analysis is only talking about a possible case and remains bullish for Ethereum in the long term.

In its latest presentation on El Salvador, the IMF called for the country to also limit public sector exposure to bitcoin.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommended on Thursday that El Salvador narrow the scope of the bitcoin law and strengthen the regulatory framework and oversight of the bitcoin ecosystem.  During a press conference, IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack also said that the IMF recommended El Salvador limiting public sector exposure to bitcoin, Reuters reported.  This isn't the first time IMF has warned El Salvador. Most recently, in August, the IMF said something similar when it declared in a statement that “while many of the risks have not yet materialized, there is joint recognition that further efforts are needed to enhance transparency and mitigate potential fiscal and financial stability risks from the Bitcoin project.” At that time, the IMF also said that “additional discussions in this and other key areas remain necessary.”  In fact, the back-and-forth history between El Salvador and the IMF over bitcoin goes back years. In November 2021, the IMF said that bitcoin should not be used as legal tender in El Salvador and urged the Central American country to strengthen the regulation and supervision of that ecosystem, something it called for again in January 2022.  El Salvador established bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021, being the first country to do so globally. Currently, it holds 5892 BTC, equivalent to about $345 million at today's price.  Nayib Bukele, El Salvador's president, recently said his plan to make the country a hotbed for the largest and oldest cryptocurrency has been “net positive” but adoption has fallen short of his expectations.  In Thursday's presentation, the IMF positively highlighted Bukele's budget for 2025, which expects the country to be debt-free.

Analyst Says $71,000 Is The Magic Number Declining Active Addresses According to the latest stats from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s active addresses have contracted by about 1.17 million to 855,000, whereas Ethereum has reduced by about 382,000 to 312,000. This equates to a 27% drawdown for Bitcoin and an 18% decline for Ethereum year-to-date. The absence of new investors entering the market appears to be the primary cause of this decline. This is essential for maintaining favorable momentum, as existing participants dominate trading activity in the absence of new capital inflows. Since early 2024, active Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses have been declining “For the bulls to dominate the market, the influx of new investors is a crucial condition. 1. Bitcoin 1.17M -> 855K 2. Ethereum 382K -> 312K” – By @burak_kesmeci Full post 👇https://t.co/gZftQidnxa pic.twitter.com/q5cdpv7x6t — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 1, 2024 The anticipated excitement surrounding the approval of spot ETFs has not translated into increased activity on the blockchain. Still, the current user base carries a lot of investors who would have expected such developments. The continued quantitative tightening of the Federal Reserve continues to strip liquidity from the market, adding more pressure to the situation. Market Sentiment And Future Prospects There are, however indications that a potential rebound is near in the face of these challenges. For example, funding rate on Ethereum has remained positive for the past week, meaning there is growing interest among investors in long positions. This implies that whereas plunges in the price of Ethereum have been ongoing, a good majority of the market remains optimistic regarding its performance going forward. BTC and ETH addresses decline: BTC drops to 855K, ETH to 312K in 2024 Since the start of 2024, the number of active Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses has continued to drop. Bitcoin addresses fell from 1.17 million to 855,000, while Ethereum addresses declined from 382,000 to… — CoinNess Global (@CoinnessGL) October 1, 2024 It’s quite interesting that large Ethereum holders have been accumulating their assets, rather than selling them off. These large holders reduced their outflows from 311,950 to 139,390, suggesting they have confidence in the long-term prospects of the altcoin. Investors that do this kind of action usually expect the prices to recover soon. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s Exchange Flow Multiple has experienced a substantial decline. This metric contrasts with short-term inflows and outflows with those over a lengthier period, indicating that current trading activity is significantly lower than historical averages. A low Exchange Flow Multiple typically suggests that investors are holding their assets in anticipation of future price increases rather than actively trading them.

The U.S. dollar surged to its strongest level since mid-August amid strong economic data, geopolitical turmoil, weighing on risk assets.  Spike in a key interbank borrowing rate may signal U.S. dollar liquidity stress, a Steno Research analyst noted.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} once again was teetering above the $60,000 level on Thursday, while smaller cryptocurrencies tumbled amid geopolitical turmoil and the surging U.S. dollar.  BTC rebounded to $61,500 during the Asian trading hours from Wednesday's very brief dip below $60,000, but turned lower during the European and U.S. sessions. The largest cryptocurrency changed hands around $60,700 recently, up 1% over the past 24 hours.  Meanwhile, the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index fell 1.5% during the same period, indicating the weakness in the rest of the digital asset market relative to BTC. Ethereum’s ether {{ETH}} was down 1%, while Ripple's XRP {{XRP}}, Solana {{SOL}}, Avalanche {{AVAX}} and Render {{RNDR}} led losses among altcoin majors.  One notable outperformer was layer-1 blockchain Aptos' {{APT}} native token gaining 7% for the day. Wednesday news of Franklin Templeton expanding its tokenized money market fund to that blockchain may explain that outperformance, while some observers speculated that traders rotated some profits from close competitor network Sui's {{SUI}} 110% rally in a month.  Bitcoin's outperformance over the broader market meant that BTC's market share of the total crypto market capitalization – also known as Bitcoin Dominance – climbed above 58%, while the ETH-to-BTC ratio dropped near its mid-September trough of 0.038.  ""Bitcoin dominance continues to trend higher, and it is now just 0.2% away from a new three-year high,” said James Van Straten, a senior analyst at CoinDesk.  U.S. dollar surging  The overall dismal week for crypto happened with increasing concerns about military escalation in the Middle East, which sent crude oil prices near $74 a barrel, the highest in more than a month, while the U.S. dollar hit its strongest level against key currencies since mid-August.  Read more: Bitcoin Not a Safe Haven From Geopolitical Risks, But Still Buy the Dip: Standard Chartered  Thursday's stronger-than-expected ISM non-manufacturing data also supported dollar strength, which usually weighs on prices for risk assets like cryptocurrencies.

What may have exacerbated dollar strength and the general risk-off move on asset markets in early October is a spike in Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), a key borrowing interest rate between banks that could be a signal of liquidity stress, Steno Research's Samuel Shiffman noted in a report.  The report added that the situation is reminiscent – albeit on a smaller scale – of the repo crisis in September 2019, when the Federal Reserve was forced to intervene to end dysfunction in key lending markets.  ""We are nearing levels where liquidity pain becomes acute,"" Shiffman said, adding that the Fed ""could feel tempted to address it"" by adding liquidity to the financial system.  Another important catalyst for markets will be Friday's U.S. jobs report.

Maybe Not, but a CryptoPunk Just Exchanged Hands for a Record $56.3M","A hallmark of the last cryptocurrency bull market was the remarkably high sale prices for various non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  The world has largely moved on from NFTs, with enthusiasm for crypto products embellished with quirky images now directed toward memecoins – so, so many memecoins.  Yet, on Thursday, a sign of bull markets past returned: A CryptoPunk NFT just exchanged hands for a record price of $56.3 million. The prior all-time high of $23.7 million was set in February 2022, months before the crypto winter got truly dark.  Punk 1563, depicting a pixelated woman with dark hair and blue eyes, fetched 24,000 ether {{ETH}} in the transaction. As recently as September, it was offered for sale for less than 30 ETH – meaning the latest deal represented a huge markup versus recent pricing.  There was a time in 2021 when another CryptoPunk technically sold for $532 million, though blockchain data clearly show the same person was on both sides of the trade.  A flash loan was apparently used to make the Punk 1563 transaction possible, blockchain data shows. The seller listed their punk for 24,000 ETH, while another ""buyer"" contract took out a flash loan for the same amount from decentralized finance protocol Balancer, paid for the NFT, and received it in their account. The borrowed ether was transferred to the seller's wallet, who promptly returned the amount to Balancer.  That means no funds were paid out-of-pocket and cannot be considered a straight sale. It's not clear what the motivations for using such a process were.  Flash loans are unsecured, non-collateralized loans in which users borrow funds and return them in the same transaction. If the user can't repay the loan before the transaction is completed the transaction is cancelled and money is returned to the protocol.

34278233,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646104,1727985614,Crypto Analyst Maintains $7.50 XRP Target Despite SEC Appeal Against Ripple,"Yesterday, Wednesday, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) formally extended the XRP lawsuit against Ripple by filing a Notice of Appeal regarding Judge Torres’s ruling. Following this news, the price of XRP plunged by more than 10%. However, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto (@egragcrypto) maintains that the bullish setup remains unchanged, with a target of $7.50 still in place for this bull run. Why $7.5 Is Still Possible For XRP Price Egrag’s analysis, shared via X, emphasizes resilience in the XRP pricing structure despite the external pressures. He noted, “I get it, the SEC appeal might feel like the end of the world, but guess what? The chart has been signaling a retest was coming! My post from yesterday nailed it. I literally said: ‘I know you’re tired of hearing ‘retest, retest,’ but LISTEN UP: the range of $0.5428 – $0.5375 is STILL in play!'” Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Climbs To $1 Billion: What’s Driving Interest In The Token? With his chart analysis, Egrag reassures holders that the foundational trading strategies should not be swayed by the legal noise. The analyst outlines two crucial trend lines which he terms the “Atlas Line” and the “Genuine Wake-Up Line.” Both trend lines have dominated the XRP price for more than four years. The “Atlas Line” serves as a baseline for the bull run’s support level, suggesting that as long as the price does not drop below this marker, the bullish outlook is still valid. The “Genuine Wake-Up Line” needs to be broken to enter bullish territory. Related Reading: Bitwise’s Spot XRP ETF Registration Statement Unveiled, Price Falls 7% However, Egrag also acknowledges that the price can deviate below or above the trend lines. “From a TA perspective, the game plan is STILL rock solid. On a MACRO LEVEL, as long as XRP doesn’t lose $0.28, we’ve got nothing to worry about. And until XRP closes above $0.75, don’t expect a full-on BULLRUN. We can still move downward to $0.43 but nothing is changed on MACRO LEVEL,” Egrag writes. The analyst remains steadfast even in volatile times, stating, “So, what’s next? NOTHING has changed: XRP IS STILL NOT A SECURITY.” He continues to challenge the prevailing market reactions and encourages looking beyond immediate fluctuations, emphasizing the importance of technical indicators over market sentiments fueled by regulatory actions. His projected “Critical Target Level” at $7.50 signifies a strong conviction in the potential upward trajectory for the crypto asset, despite the current market setbacks. This target is audaciously higher than the current price levels. The price would have to rally more than 1,300%. Addressing the community and doubters, Egrag writes, “Everything in between? Just noise. And yeah, this noise may feel nasty to the newbies, but OGs know it’s just more time to stack up. Honestly, I’m HAPPY about this appeal: Why? Because it gives my other coins a chance to pump, and when they do, I’m putting 100% of those profits into XRP.” At press time, XRP traded at $0.5238.

42407484,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZI8I9,1727980519,Binance's Crypto Market Share Sinks to 4-Year Low,"Last month, Binance's combined market share in spot and derivatives volume dropped to its lowest level since September 2020, according to CCData.  Overall trading volumes in September fell to the lowest since June, with trading activity expected to pick up in the last quarter amid Fed rate cuts, CCData said.  Crypto exchange giant Binance's lead over rivals melted to its narrowest in four years as rivals grabbed market share, CCData said in a Thursday report.  Binance handled 36.6% of overall spot and derivatives trading volume on centralized crypto exchanges, the exchange's worst result since September 2020.  Its spot trading dropped by nearly 23% from August, driving its spot market share down to 27%, the lowest reading since January 2021, the report said. The platform's derivatives trading also declined 21%, representing a 40.7% market share among centralized exchanges, the lowest level since September 2020.  Binance representatives haven't returned a request for comment by publishing time.  One of the beneficiaries of Binance's decline was Crypto.com, which grew its spot and derivatives trading volume by more than 40% on a month-to-month basis, CCData pointed out. Year-to-date, the exchange booked the largest gain in spot trading, increasing its market share to 10.5%.  Overall, trading activity on crypto exchanges waned last month with derivatives and spot trading volumes both falling 17%, the report noted. September historically marks the end of a weak mid-year season in trading, giving way to a busier last quarter, CCData analysts said. ""With catalysts such as increased market liquidity following the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut and the upcoming U.S. election, trading activity on centralized exchanges is expected to rise in the coming months,"" the authors wrote.  Binance's waning dominance coincided with increasing regulatory pressure on the exchange.  Last month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a proposed amended complaint against Binance, scrutinizing the exchange's token listing practice. It was a follow-up on the regulator's June 2023 lawsuit, which alleged Binance operated as an unregistered broker, clearinghouse and trading venue, and offered unregistered securities. The exchange agreed to pay a $4.3 billion fine to various U.S. regulators to settle those charges.  The company's founder and former CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four months in prison for violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) by failing to set up adequate know-your-customer (KYC) systems at the trading venue.

34275975,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646106,1727980244,Crypto Analyst Says Solana-Based BONK Is In Prime Position For Legendary Rally,"Lately, top meme based cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) have been witnessing a spike in their prices. This bullish trend appears to have extended to Solana based meme coin Bonk (BONK), as its price movements has been showing signs of an impending bullish surge. With respect to this, a crypto analyst has suggested that Bonk is currently well-positioned for a significant upward movement. Analyst Predicts Legendary Target At $0.000033 Bluntz, a prominent crypto trader and analyst has revealed the next bullish target for Bonk. In an X (formerly Twitter) post on September 30, Bluntz revealed that Bonk is currently in a prime position for a”turbo green week.” Related Reading: Dogecoin At $10 Thesis: What Each Breakout Cycle Says About The DOGE Price He disclosed that the meme coin had experienced a quick and minor price dip during the week. However, the analyst sees this price decline as a positive sign, suggesting that it creates an opportunity for Bonk to enter a significantly bullish position, potentially triggering a legendary rally. Sharing a chart depicting Bonk’s price movements from the past month, Bluntz indicated in his price chart that the meme coin could experience an accelerated price increase to new highs. Presenting an illustration of his predictions of Bonk’s future price movements, the analyst disclosed that the meme coin would rise between the range of $0.000028 and $0.000027 before falling to the support level between $0.000026 and $0.000025. After this, Bonk is expected to skyrocket to $0.00003, before dropping back to $0.000028. For his final price surge in his projected turbo green week, Bluntz revealed that Bonk will reach a new price high of $0.000033. The analyst also revealed that for Bonk to experience a bullish price breakout, the meme coin will have to undergo three days of essential sideways trading. Presently the price of Bonk is trading at $0.00002, reflecting a slight increase of 3.86% in the past week. A jump to projected highs at $0.000033 would require the meme coin to rise by approximately 65% from its current price. BONK Set To Outperform PEPE While maintaining an optimistic outlook on Bonk’s price, Bluntz disclosed that the meme coin may be taking out the meme coin leadership from Pepe. This suggests that as Bonk is gaining more momentum, Pepe’s performance is slowing down after experiencing a significant price increase. Related Reading: Still Holding Your Hamster Kombat Tokens? You Might Be In For A Nice Surprise Soon The analyst has identified a “higher low” on the BONK/PEPE chart, which indicates that Bonk is positioning itself for a stronger price rally than Pepe. Typically, a higher low occurs when the price of a cryptocurrency pulls back but maintains its value above its previous low level, signaling a potential continuation of an uptrend. In the case of Bonk, Bluntz has revealed that it is currently among top meme coins like Dogwifhat (WIF), and Pepe which are presently showing signs of a strong bullish development. Despite this analysis, the cryptocurrency has declined by over 10% in the past 24 hours.

42407480,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZI7v0,1727975381,Why You Should (Still) Care About Silvergate,"Last week, I published a new article revisiting the last days of the doomed pro-crypto bank Silvergate, alleging that it had been effectively killed off by federal regulators within the Biden administration. You may be wondering why I am relitigating events that took place in the spring of 2023.  The truth is, I believe that those fateful events are widely misunderstood, and that hindsight has brought us more information to better understand what really took place. The conventional narrative is that Silvergate, Signature, and others were the architects of their own demise. They accepted crypto firms as clients and paid the price when the crypto space experienced tremors in 2022 and 2023; and mismanaged the maturity of their asset portfolio throughout a period of rising rates.  But I hold a different view. In my opinion, we have evidence enough to suggest that the two most important pro-crypto banks, Silvergate and Signature, were opportunistically executed amid the fog of war during the 2023 banking crisis, as part of a broader coordinated attempt to de-bank the crypto industry. The Biden administration went far further than simply discouraging banks from serving crypto; they actually shuttered the two most critical banks that were serving the sector. This brazen scheme has never been talked about in DC. Establishment post mortems of the banking crisis focus on interest rates, maturity mismatches in asset portfolios and depository flight.  We have enough evidence now to make sense of what really happened. One sign that something was amiss was Signature board member Barney Frank alleging that the bank was shut down “because of our prominent identification with crypto.” A banker familiar with the process told me: “Signature wasn’t even given a chance to raise capital and save themselves. It was definitely an execution.” For their part, the New York Department of Financial Services, the state’s main regulator, denies this.  There were also significant irregularities in the process of selling Signature. FDIC refused to allow Flagstar, Signature’s acquirer, to take ownership of $4 billion of deposits from crypto firms. The funds were forcibly sent back to depositors. The sale of Signature’s SigNet network, which allowed bank crypto clients to transact between each other 24/7, was also stymied. One banker involved in the process told me that Tassat (the developer of SigNet tech) was interested in buying back the asset.  Apollo Global Management had also lined up a consortium to place a bid. The person familiar with the situation told me: “The FDIC didn’t put it in writing, but they called during the bidding process and told us verbally ‘Don’t bid on the crypto products.’” The auction for SigNet finally went live on Friday, June 9 2023 – the week that the SEC sued Binance and Coinbase. There were no bids and the SigNet asset was furloughed completely.  As a reminder, the FDIC’s stated mandate is to maximize taxpayer value by arranging the sale of all bank assets, not just the ones that are politically benign. A subsequent memo from the Congressional Research Service noted that “This reluctance [of banks to serve crypto] was evinced by the FDIC’s announcement that it will return Signature’s deposits to crypto firms…,” acknowledging that the FDIC’s excising of Signature’s crypto business was a telling. The WSJ Editorial Board, for its part, felt that this was a smoking gun, writing “This [refusal by the FDIC to sell the crypto business] confirms Mr. Frank’s suspicions — and ours — that Signature’s seizure was motivated by regulators’ hostility toward crypto.”  And then there’s Silvergate. Silvergate was never sold, but rather voluntarily liquidated by management. None of its executives have since dared speak up. In early 2023, the SF Fed communicated to them, with the seeming tacit approval of other regulators, that they would have to reduce their crypto deposits to a de minimis share of their overall business. This was fatal to its practice – as over 90% of their deposits related to the crypto space as of Q2 2022. Following the bank run in Dec. 2022-Jan. 2023, Silvergate was still solvent. After all was said and done, they were able to make all depositors whole, even though they were cut off from last-resort liquidity at the FHLB thanks to a pressure campaign from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).  Perversely, Silvergate leadership have not been able to speak up regarding the sudden change in regulatory policy, as they have been busy settling cases with their regulatory overseers, alongside class actions. Revelations regarding the informal cap on deposits that made their business impossible are considered “confidential supervisory information” and hence ineligible to be publicly shared.  This kind of financial redlining is a violation of the due process clause in the Fifth Amendment  However, in recent bankruptcy filings, Silvergate Chief Accounting Officer Elaine Hetrick for the first time laid out Silvergate’s version of the story. She directly accuses regulators of forcing a shutdown of the bank, writing: “This public signaling and sudden regulatory shift made clear that, at least as of the first quarter of 2023, the Federal Bank Regulatory Agencies would not tolerate banks with significant concentrations of digital asset customers, ultimately preventing Silvergate Bank from continuing its digital asset focused business model.”  Both Silvergate and Signature faced rumors during the panic of 2023 that they were under criminal investigation relating to their dealings with the crypto space. Silvergate was infamously a service provider to FTX. These allegations formed a large part of the case against the banks made by high profile short sellers – as well as Warren. No criminal allegations ever materialized. Silvergate settled with regulators for surveillance outages on SEN, the bank’s exchange network. It settled with the SEC with respect to perceived inaccuracies in statements made by management regarding their compliance program.  Thus, the passage of time has brought things into focus. The allegations of criminality swirling around the banks ended up being vacuous. New filings from Silvergate lend credence to the idea that they were liquidated by political mandate. And, since the crisis, bank regulators have continued to harass banks known to serve crypto, like Customers and Cross River, who have both been hit with enforcement actions or consent orders.  Newer banks are being prohibited from filling the gap, too. Custodia continues to wage a protracted legal campaign to obtain a master account at the Fed, a necessary precondition to becoming a full-fledged bank. Meanwhile, Protego Trust Company, which had received a preliminary federal charter from the OCC, saw its charter revoked. Not only were existing pro-crypto banks killed off, and new aspirants discouraged from doing business with the sector, but newer entrants were simply prohibited from opening their doors. Within the conventional banking sector, bad rules like the SEC’s SAB121 (whose congressional overturn was vetoed by Biden) effectively prohibit banks from touching crypto. The Fed has also issued dire warnings about banks wanting to do business with stablecoins. The crackdown on crypto via financial regulation has been incredibly comprehensive and involved every important U.S. financial regulator.  U.S.-based crypto entrepreneurs and operators know first-hand that obtaining banking is uniquely challenging – harder than it should be. Even though we in the crypto space are the primary victims of this round of financial repression, this issue goes far beyond crypto. Ultimately, it’s about the government unconstitutionally choosing to marginalize a specific (legal) industry, not by passing a law or with notice-and-comment rulemaking, but via covert, informal threats made to bankers.  As the law firm Cooper & Kirk has argued, this kind of financial redlining is a violation of the due process clause in the Fifth Amendment, because affected firms are not given the opportunity to challenge these rules. Secret, informal rulemaking also may violate the administrative procedures act. Ultimately, this issue comes down to the fundamental question: should banking infrastructure – effectively an arm of the state – be weaponized for political ends, or should it remain neutral, free for any legal business to rely on?  Sadly, the contemporary left appears comfortable using bank regulation against political disfavored industries, both under Obama and again under Biden. While Trump was more reticent to employ the same tactics, it's not inconceivable that the shoe could be on the other foot soon. There is a partisan tinge to the fact-pattern but there doesn’t have to be one. As a highly regulated industry with barriers to entry, banking should not be deputized for arbitrary political ends. Crypto is the latest victim of this misbehavior, but this issue should deeply concern anyone.

34273672,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646078,1727974803,Solana Hits Critical $137 Support: Can Bulls Prevent A Breakdown?,"Solana has hit the key $137 support level, and the bulls are now facing intense pressure to prevent a downward breakout. With the market momentum hanging in the balance, all eyes are on whether the bulls can defend this critical zone and spark a potential rebound. A strong defense at this level could signal renewed bullish strength, while a breakdown could pave the way for further declines. As traders anticipate Solana’s next move, this article aims to explore its crucial test at the $137 support level, focusing on whether the bulls can withstand increasing pressure. It will evaluate the potential for either a breakout or a rebound, offering insights into SOL’s short-term price direction by delving into key technical indicators and market sentiment. Analyzing the RSI And Moving Averages: Bullish Or Bearish Outlook? Recently, after struggling to break above the $164 resistance level, Solana has adopted a negative trajectory on the 4-hour chart. The price is currently trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), suggesting a shift in market sentiment, as SOL now targets a potential bearish breakout at the $137 level. If the price continues to decline and breaches this support, it could trigger extended selling pressure and open the door to additional losses. Also, an analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals that the RSI has fallen to around 33%, indicating that the buying pressure is diminishing, reflecting a shift in market dynamics. An RSI below 40% often signifies that an asset may be entering oversold territory, which can lead to potential further declines. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Failure To Break $154 Could Lead To $85 Correction – Analyst On the daily chart, SOL is displaying notable negative movement, evident from a series of bearish candlesticks. This persistent downward trend underscores the prevailing selling pressure in the market, indicating that bears are firmly in control. Additionally, Solana is trading below the 100-day SMA, suggesting a lack of bullish momentum and reinforcing the likelihood of continued declines. Finally, on the 1-day chart, a closer look at the RSI formation shows that the RSI signal line has fallen to 43%, having recently breached the crucial 50% threshold. An RSI reading below 50 typically reflects a bearish sentiment, signaling that the asset is losing strength. Such a drop could imply further downside potential for SOL unless a reversal occurs. Key Support Level At $137: Can Solana Bulls Hold The Line? The $137 support level is crucial for Solana, representing a significant battleground between bulls and bears. If bulls succeed in defending this support, it could instill confidence in the market and pave the way for a potential recovery toward the $164 resistance level. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Could Crash 40% If It Stays Below $140 – Top Analyst Shares Insights Nonetheless, a breach below the $137 support level could trigger significant selling pressure, resulting in additional declines toward the $118 support level. When this level is breached, it may lead to more losses, with potential targets including lower support areas around the $99 mark. Such a scenario would intensify bearish sentiment and could lead to a more pronounced downtrend in Solana’s price.

34271349,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646059,1727969423,Dogecoin On-Chain Spike Triggers 180% Price Rally Prediction—What’s Next?,"Even with recent market corrections and geopolitical tensions, Dogecoin (DOGE) keeps seeing an uptick in both whales and retail investor activity. Data by Santiment reveals that whale transactions have hit new highs since June. Before the price peak of September 28, those major investors had controlled some 1,203 transactions worth more than $10 million. Such activity suggests that despite the macro market’s negativity, significant stakeholders within the Dogecoin ecosystem are optimistic. Related Reading: Breakout Looms: XRP To Hit $7.5 After ‘Wake-Up Line,’ According To Analyst A clear rise in active addresses on the Dogecoin network is another important indication supporting this positivism. Some 63,689 DOGE addresses have changed tokens during the past three days; this is the biggest figure seen since six months ago. 🐶 Dogecoin has retraced -18% from its top back on Saturday. But on-chain activity indicates that whales may not be done with all the bullish momentum of crypto’s top meme coin. Though they took profit just before the top, their activity remains very high on DOGE’s network. pic.twitter.com/FsmWJGkSE6 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 2, 2024 This level of activity is similar to what occurred in the early days of April. Ali Martinez, an expert, further confirmed the boom, saying active addresses have ballooned to 84,306-strong influx of retail interest into the meme coin. Such interest positively augurs well for the future of Dogecoin, especially when related to the latest number of wallet addresses being created. Growing Adoption Fuels Possible Rally This on-chain activity rise is not a small blip on the radar. Martinez has found a very promising indicator on the Dogecoin weekly chart; a price rally will most likely be caused. He drew attention to a bullish MACD crossover which will probably lead to a 180% increase in the price of DOGE. Both of the previous two occasions when this metric flipped back into bull territory, Dogecoin provided an astronomical increase of 85% in October 2023 and a whopping 175% gain in February 2024. If history is any guide, this could mean good things are on the horizon for Dogecoin. DOGE market cap currently at $14.8 billion. Chart: TradingView.com It’s worthy to note that the overall market sentiment for Dogecoin is bearish, based on the latest price predictions by CoinCodex. Based on their analysis, DOGE may drop by 13% and hit around $0.091695 by November 2, 2024. A reading of 37 from the Fear & Greed Index still places the traders’ sentiment on the worry side. Dogecoin has in the last 30 days been able to experience 16 green days, accounting for only 53% of the time, with an average price volatility standing at 8.15%. This volatility paints sensitivity by Dogecoin towards market fluctuations. Related Reading: Could XRP See A 360% Surge By Christmas? Experts Think So Navigating Uncertainty In The Market Given the mixed signals, traders and investors are advised to tread carefully. Although the increase in whale activity and retail interaction points to an underlying demand for Dogecoin, one cannot overlook the negative sentiment and possible price drop. The present volatility of the market could be risky for new investors wishing to engage right now. Whether Dogecoin can stabilize or if it will keep trending down in the next weeks will depend mostly on a concentration on important support levels.

42407479,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZI81c,1727967600,Crypto for Advisors: Crypto as a Growth Driver,"In today’s issue, Nathan McCauley, co-founder & CEO of Anchorage Digital, explores how crypto could be a growth driver for advisors.  In Ask an Expert, Marissa Kim from Abra Capital Management answers questions advisors may have about including crypto in their practice.  – Sarah Morton  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Crypto is a Growth Driver for Wealth Managers  For wealth managers, crypto presents a key opportunity for growth – especially with rising mainstream interest after the approval of spot bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier this year.  As organic growth in wealth management declines and the marketplace becomes more crowded and competitive, crypto can help wealth managers drive client retention and reach new clients with a differentiated offering.  Between the new spot ETFs and separately managed accounts (SMAs), wealth managers have a wide menu of options to offer crypto to their end clients.  ETFs and streamlined adoption  Spot ETFs present a streamlined path for wealth managers to offer crypto, especially for those who use ETF-based model portfolios. In recent months, some of the largest players – from major wealth management firms to Wall Street banks – have allowed advisors to offer crypto ETFs to eligible clients.  The ETF wrapper has unlocked serious latent interest in integrating crypto into traditional portfolios, driving tens of billions of dollars into the digital asset class through a regulated and accessible investment vehicle. Competition amongst ETF issuers in the U.S., in particular, sparked fee compression for these products, benefiting crypto ETF shareholders.  While spot crypto ETFs continue to be a significant unlock across mainstream and institutional finance, there are a few things wealth managers need to keep in mind. First, only SEC-regulated spot ETFs for bitcoin and ether are available on the market today. Like all spot ETFs, these products give shareholders direct exposure to – but not direct ownership of – the underlying asset.  As a result, wealth managers should also consider other complementary avenues for crypto ownership, such as SMAs.  Crypto SMAs as the next evolution  With rising adoption of SMAs across the board and increasing interest in crypto as an asset class, crypto SMAs represent a perfect marriage. By combining direct ownership with professional management, crypto SMAs offer significant benefits for both wealth managers and clients alike.  A qualified custodian serves as the base layer of a compliant crypto SMA. Today, wealth managers can access qualified custodians for crypto through turnkey asset management platforms, third-party technology platforms, and direct integrations. Safekeeping crypto with a qualified custodian gives end clients the regulatory certainty they need to participate in the asset class.  For end clients, crypto SMAs unlock the ability to access a broader range of digital assets – beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. The SMA structure also allows for greater flexibility in portfolio construction, which means end clients can deploy more personalized investment strategies. End clients may also benefit from improved tax efficiency.  For wealth managers, what does all of this mean? Greater client choice, which translates into enhanced client retention and differentiation from competitors in the market. By offering crypto SMAs, wealth managers can help future-proof their businesses – while providing the safety, security and regulatory certainty that clients have come to expect.  Embracing crypto through SMAs and complementary vehicles like spot ETFs can help position wealth managers to play a leading role in financial innovation, driving both long-term client satisfaction and business growth.  - Nathan McCauley, co-founder & CEO of Anchorage Digital  Ask an Expert  Q: How large of an opportunity does crypto represent? We want to understand how much firm resources we should devote toward gaining knowledge of crypto products.  It is estimated that about 50 million Americans (15%) already own crypto today, which means some of your clients likely already have exposure or are interested in getting exposure. Moreover, the adoption of cryptocurrencies is happening faster than the adoption of the internet, and we believe this participation rate may skyrocket over the next five years so that there will be significant demand from your clients.  As the wealth transfer from Boomers to Millennials occurs over the next five to 20 years, we believe millennials will have greater interest in owning cryptocurrencies and are likely to want to hold those assets directly, versus through ETFs or ETPs. There are still ways for advisors to be value-add to this type of client, but it does require investment of time to learn how clients will want to access these assets and the full breadth of product offerings beyond the ETFs.  Q: Where do digital assets fit into client portfolios from an allocation perspective?  Bitcoin is now being considered by some as a risk asset and as an asset that you would hold in a lower risk, defensive bucket, similar to precious metals or bonds. That being said, many advisors we speak to are only recommending to their clients exposure of 1-5% of total investable net worth to Bitcoin for now.  Assets like Ethereum and Solana are still being considered mostly in a high-risk bucket, more similar to owning single high-growth technology stocks, which can have significant upside as adoption continues but will also continue to be volatile, which may not be suitable for large position sizing or for some types of more conservative investors.  Q: What will happen with the regulatory environment in the U.S. - should we wait to make recommendations until the landscape is more settled?  In general, there is uncertainty in the U.S. around how digital assets should be treated under current law and whether the SEC and/or CFTC have jurisdiction over certain assets. There are many inconsistent approaches from various U.S. agencies and active cases going through the legal system now that are starting to show where the gaps are. There have also been several bipartisan crypto-related bills proposed over the last year.  While the industry certainly needs more regulatory clarity, BTC and ETH have some certainty following the approval of the spot ETFs, which confirmed that these assets are commodities - which is why these assets are likely to see increased institutional adoption.  - Marissa Kim, head of Asset Management, Abra Capital Management  Keep Reading  Driven by bitcoin, Inflows into crypto-related investment products continued for the third consecutive week.

Despite increased transactions per second due to L2 scaling, the value isn't filtering back to ETH, which signals a possible flaw in the chain's economic model. Capital flight from spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States likely hasn't helped the matter with more Ethereum coming out of ETHE than going into Grayscale's Mini Trust. With collapsing network fees and declining coin prices, ETH's circulating P/F valuation multiple has hit 4-year highs. Investors in the United States have never had an easier path to investing in the Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) blockchain. To be fair, it hasn't been all that difficult for the moderately crypto-interested to buy ETH through centralized exchange platforms like Coinbase ( COIN ) or Binance ( BNB-USD ). But for more traditional investors, spot Ethereum ETF approvals in late-July figured to be financial products that put a large, sustained bid on ETH. After more than two months in the wild, I don't think it's a stretch to say the opposite has happened. Despite the massive success of the spot Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETFs since January, Ethereum has not enjoyed the same exuberance from investors. Data by YCharts Not only has Ethereum fallen by over 30% since spot ETFs were launched in the United States, but the coin has badly under-performed Bitcoin and many other leading cryptocurrencies in the market. In this article, we'll attempt to make sense of the under-performance by looking at capital Flows, key metrics on Ethereum mainnet, the layer 2 ecosystem, and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF ( ETH ). Grayscale & Capital Flight For years, the easiest way to get exposure to Ethereum in a traditional brokerage account was through the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ). Prior to converting that fund to an ETF, it was a closed-end fund that often traded at a considerable discount to net asset value. In my view, there were two major factors that contributed to that discount. The first was Grayscale's large 2.5% annual fee. The second was the lack of staking off the fund's assets. Unlike, Bitcoin which runs on a proof-of-work consensus, Ethereum can generate yield through staking. ETH held in US-based ETFs is not staked, thus, an opportunity cost and a discount from the market. Following the approval of spot BTC ETFs in January, we saw a significant level of capital flight out of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) because of the uncompetitive fees. The same has been true for ETHE. However, this time the new lower-fee ETFs aren't making up the difference. It's less of a 'fee flight' for Ethereum and more of a straight up 'capital flight.' Spot ETH ETF Supply (The Block) Since spot funds were launched, the new funds have not made up the difference in the $2.9 billion Ethereum outflow from ETHE. As of October 2nd, the total net flow of capital from the spot ETH ETFs has been a $552 million outflow. Worse for Grayscale, the firm's Ethereum Mini Trust has not been much of a factor as there has only been $294.4 million of inflow into that fund following the substantial seed balance after being spun out from ETHE. There are three other spot ETH ETFs that have brought in more capital. Data by YCharts In the chart above, the Grayscale Mini Trust shows a negative AUM change from the seed balance simply because the price of the underlying has performed so poorly. As an investment option though, I don't actually think Grayscale's Ethereum Mini ETF is a poor choice for those who want tax advantaged exposure to Ethereum. The expense ratio is just 0.15% - an enormous improvement over that of ETHE and like many other funds, that fee has been waived entirely for an introductory period. I should note that it's a big world out there and just because US-based spot ETFs have been a disappointment, there are other ways to buy Ethereum in traditional financial products. Despite the more recent woes, we've seen positive year to date investment capital flow into Ethereum through September: Capital Flow By Asset (CoinShares) As of September 27th, the year to date flow into Ethereum has been $765 million. While positive, frankly, I think this has been massively underwhelming. Especially when compared to Bitcoin. Capital flow into BTC makes up more than 93% of the total crypto capital flow this year. Ethereum is not getting its 'fair share' from investors. I do have a theory as to why and it's not pretty. Mainnet Fees and L2 Scaling In the month of September, the Ethereum blockchain generated $103.7 million in fees. This was a 12% year over year increase from $92.7 million in ETH fees from September 2023 and a 65% increase over August. While fees in September were still well below the 2024 high of $607 million in March, September was the most promising month for ETH fee revenue since June. ETH Price vs Monthly Fees (Token Terminal) The argument has been, and I’ve echoed this , that fee migration from mainnet to L2s isn’t necessarily a bad thing so long as the broader ecosystem scales exponentially and returns that value back to mainnet over time. The thinking here is ETH bulls benefit from getting a smaller piece of an enormous pie rather than a large piece of a far smaller pie. Thus, scaling via L2 theoretically has some validity provided the math works. However, what we've seen in practice since the Dencun upgrade earlier this year is more evident of L2 value extraction from the growing ecosystem rather than value filtering back to ETH if price is the primary indicator. ETH Ecosystem TPS Growth (L2Beat) It’s important to note the scaling factor here and how it has changed over time. While it has come off a bit from the 440 TPS highs in August, this chart is essentially telling us that the transactions per second in the ETH ecosystem from secondary chains are currently about 23x the throughput of mainnet. The scaling multiplier has been improving quite quickly since Dencun and it hasn’t really benefited Ethereum holders. ETH/BTC Weekly (TrendSpider) Despite the growth in secondary chain usage, primary layer network fees have collapsed and the price of ETH has generally been sinking against both dollars and Bitcoin. Valuation When ETH spiked up to $3,800 in May, the circulating price to fee ratio had ballooned to over 300x fees. For Ethereum, this was well ahead of the four-year trend and even nearing historical highs going back to 2020. And yet, even with the 40% pullback in the price of ETH since that P/F spike, network fees had fallen so badly through August that the circulating P/F ratio briefly eclipsed 570x in early September: Ethereum P/F ratio (Token Terminal) For the full month of September, the average circulating price to fee multiple for ETH was 455x fees - the highest full-month average for the ratio since April 2020. The fact that we saw 4 year high P/F valuation multiples for ETH while the coin price is going down is a really telling signal, in my view, and not a good one. From where I sit, this is a clear indication that the economic model for Ethereum is flawed given current demand levels. Network Users MAUs vs Price (Token Terminal) If there is any positive takeaway that I can provide, it’s that monthly active users of Ethereum are still holding up quite well. A multitude of other L1 chains have experienced collapsing MAUs this year but Ethereum has generally held above 6 million monthly users every completed month this year with January being the lone exception. When considering the daily active address growth on the layer 2 chains, the trend looks quite impressive. Here's ETH ecosystem DAAs in a stacked chart format: Ethereum + L2 Chain DAAs (Artemis) The chart above is showing combined daily active addresses on Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum ( ARB-USD ), Blast (BLAST-USD), Optimism ( OP-USD ), Polygon zkEVM ( MATIC-USD ), Scroll, StarkNet (STRK-USD), zkSync Era (ZK-USD), and Zora Network — all ETH L2s. The DAA trend is up and I didn't even include other chains like Polygon POS that have done quite well in the DAA area. The same is true for transactions where the stacked trend is clearly positive: Ethereum + L2 Chain Txs (Artemis) And yet something doesn’t seem to be working. None of this is actually helping ETH. In fact, it’s arguably hurting the value proposition for ETH the asset because the organic bid for gas on mainnet is going away even as ecosystem usage expands. The L2s that are scaling the chain are collecting fees but not paying a large enough portion of that revenue back to the main network compared to the pre-Dencun environment. Closing Summary While the fee market for Ethereum mainnet no doubt improved in September after several months of declining numbers, the larger trend this year has not been a strong one. I’m by no means throwing in the towel altogether on Ethereum or saying that I think it’s not still one of the better bets in the blockchain space; I still do believe that. But there's a potential problem with the structure of the network at the moment and I don’t see a clear catalyst turning that around. Proper valuation has always been an elusive concept in the crypto markets and coins are worth whatever people are willing to pay for them. ETH has a really straightforward bull thesis as the gas token of the largest smart contract ecosystem in the industry. But some of the bullish elements of ETH have been lost; it's once again an inflationary token. Active bid for gas payment has dwindled with the success of L2 scaling. And the capital investment story simply hasn't held up to expectations. For all the reasons listed, ETH might be a half decent contrarian bet at this point as sentiment is poor. However, I'm calling ETH a 'hold' today until we see a more sustained return in mainnet fees from L2 growth.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724808-grayscale-ethereum-mini-trust-making-sense-of-under-performance-eth-ethusd?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34269749.jpeg

His statement has got the crypto community searching for answers as to what this pattern might mean for BTC. Veteran Crypto Trader Says Bitcoin Has Formed ‘Three Blind Mice Pattern’ Peter Brandt stated in an X post that Bitcoin had formed the infamous “Three Blind Mice and a Piece of Cheese” trading pattern. However, the veteran trader didn’t provide more insights as to what he meant by this pattern. His accompanying chart suggested that this might be bearish for BTC as the last candlesticks that formed on the chart hinted at a downtrend. Related Reading: Dogecoin At $10 Thesis: What Each Breakout Cycle Says About The DOGE Price The ‘Three Blind Mice’ pattern is said to appear after an uptrend in the market, indicating a bearish reversal. This means that the bears now have the upper hand in the market, and Bitcoin is likely to suffer more downward pressure. Indeed, this looks to be Bitcoin’s current price action considering the crypto’s retracement since it climbed above $65,000 last week. Bitcoin rose above $65,000 as it headed for its best monthly close in September since 2013. However, since October began, the flagship crypto has witnessed a significant price correction, suggesting that it might once again be in bearish territory. BTC has yet to lose its critical support at $60,000, which has provided some comfort to the Bulls. Bitcoin’s price correction has been primarily due to the rising tensions in the Middle East, with the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Iran. The flagship crypto retested the $60,000 support level following Iran’s missile strike on Israel. Meanwhile, Peter Brandt’s earlier X post suggests that the veteran trader is currently bearish on Bitcoin’s trajectory. He stated that the recent BTC rally didn’t disturb the “7-month sequence of lower highs and lower lows.” He added that only a close above $71,000, confirmed by a new all-time high (ATH), will indicate that the trend from the November 22 low remains in force. Bitcoin Could Drop To As Low As $52,000 Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has also predicted that Bitcoin could drop to as low as $52,000. He stated that this would happen if the governing pattern behind the recent price action were a descending parallel channel. Analyst Justin Bennett also provided a bearish outlook for BTC, stating that a case can be made for the flagship crypto dropping to $51,000. Related Reading: Still Holding Your Hamster Kombat Tokens? You Might Be In For A Nice Surprise Soon However, he added that he isn’t certain of the drop to $51,000 right now. What he is more certain of is Bitcoin dropping to $57,000, having reached his first target of $60,000. He also warned Bitcoin investors about any relief rally that the flagship crypto might enjoy while stating that the failure at $64,700 has opened up sell-side liquidity. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $61,000, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The fund will be capped at $100 million at debut, and raised to $500 million in Q1 next year.  Decentralized private credit platform Credbull is rolling out a new fixed yield credit facility LiquidStone, with a capacity of up to $500 million, exclusively on the real-world asset (RWA) focused blockchain Plume Network, the protocols announced on Thursday.  In the first phase, the product debuts with a fixed 30-day 10% annualized yield with daily redemption features on assets and yield, with assets capped at $100 million at the beginning. The protocol plans a broader rollout in the first quarter of 2025, raising the maximum capacity to $500 million and offering a 90-day fixed yield of 15% annualized.  On top of the yield, both retail and institutional investors may earn rewards for participating in the Plume ecosystem. The underlying assets are diversified across on-chain ""high quality liquid assets,"" collateralized on-chain lending and high yield trade financing solutions underwritten by loan originators focusing on small and mid-size businesses.  Private credit has been one of the first frontiers of crypto's RWA tokenization movement, a process that brings traditional financial instruments such as bonds, commodities and funds to blockchain rails in pursuit of efficiency, transparency and accessibility gains.  The blockchain-based private credit market currently stands at $9 billion, rwa.xyz data shows, dominated by fintech firm Figure's home equity credit line service using the Provenance blockchain. That's still tiny compared to the booming private credit market in traditional finance, which the IMF estimated to be worth over $2 trillion.

CleanSpark's capacity expansion and substantial Bitcoin holdings enhance its competitive positioning and potential correlation with Bitcoin's price. The stock's valuation against Bitcoin has contracted without fundamental reasons, suggesting a potential upside as this contraction unwinds. I reiterate a Strong Buy rating for CleanSpark, anticipating significant returns if Bitcoin breaks out of its bullish consolidation pattern. The ongoing consolidation in Bitcoin has lasted longer than I would have expected pre-halving, but we have to trade the market we have, not the market we want. That is quite the case with Bitcoin miner CleanSpark (CLSK), which I last covered six months ago. The stock was in the mid-teens at the time, testing key support around $15. I liked CleanSpark then, and while it bounced around some, it ultimately failed that support level a few months later. CleanSpark shares have very clearly broken down and look bearish, but I believe the valuation supports the bulls that are brave enough to take the plunge. Keep in mind that short interest is very high on CleanSpark at about 18%, so it's a volatile stock, to say the least. However, if you are interested in owning CleanSpark, now may just be the time to consider building that position. Let's dig in. A bearish breakdown, but nearing support again There's no denying that the stock broke down in a massive way in August. The absolutely critical support level of $14/$15 gave way and the stock never looked back. StockCharts Shorts have pressed the stock down to under $9 again, a level that was previously not seen since the early stages of this year. The stock is below the moving averages, the PPO is well into negative territory, and the RSI hasn't seen 60+ since July. In short, there's nothing bullish here. What's really interesting is that while CleanSpark's chart looks awful , that of Bitcoin itself actually looks pretty good. StockCharts This is a three-year weekly chart, and we can see some very bullish developments. I see a bull flag that has formed, which is comprised of the ""pole"" from summer of 2023 to the peak in spring of 2024, as well as the ""flag"" that has formed in the channel I've drawn above. A bull flag is a continuation pattern, so as long as the flag doesn't break to the downside, we should plan on seeing higher prices in the months to come. On the bullish side of the ledger, the weekly PPO has been reset and is stabilizing near the centerline. That has coincided with two tests of the 50-week moving average (in blue above), and I fully expect we will not break the 50-week moving average. On the charting front, CleanSpark looks awful while Bitcoin looks like it is nearing the end of a bullish consolidation. What to do then? Let's take a look at the fundamental picture on CleanSpark first. Building capacity (and profitability) CleanSpark has spent years building its capacity to mine Bitcoin, and very much continues to do so. Investor presentation The company is the second-largest Bitcoin miner as measured by realized hash rate, which now stands at over 26 EH/s. While that alone is not a reason to own the stock, Bitcoin mining is all about scale and efficiency, and being a huge player is a big head start towards efficiency. Investor presentation The company expects 32 EH/s by the end of the year as it continues to bring capacity online via acquisitions and organic growth. That growth will continue to come in handy because the difficulty in mining Bitcoin is growing all the time. CoinWarz This is a one-year chart, and we can see that - on the bright side for miners - difficulty has been stable since the halving in April. It climbed significantly into that event, however, so year-on-year, mining is still much more difficult than it was. That is the long-term trend, of course, so adding capacity simply helps to offset this rising difficulty. However, CleanSpark is adding capacity quickly enough it can both overcome this rising difficulty, and mine more Bitcoin over time. Its competitive positioning from a scale perspective against the other miners makes it attractive, in my view. The other wrinkle here is that CleanSpark is not just a miner; it now has a pretty sizable hoard of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Investor presentation The company owns almost 8,000 coins, which are worth roughly half a billion dollars today. Given this, as the company continues to mine Bitcoin and hold them on the balance sheet, its share price should become ever more correlated to the price of Bitcoin itself. And with the balance sheet we see below, CleanSpark has the ability to hold (rather than sell) most of the Bitcoin it mines. Investor presentation This slide is a bit of an eye chart, but the important bits are the stockholders' equity (~$1.4 billion) and basically non-existent long-term liabilities. CleanSpark's balance sheet really couldn't look much better, so it has little to no financing risk. With some miners/owners of Bitcoin using significant leverage, CleanSpark stands apart in this way. What about the valuation? This is where things get pretty interesting from my perspective. CleanSpark's price chart is terrible, and there's no point in arguing about that. However, with CleanSpark being a massive player in mining, having ~$1.4 billion in book value on its balance sheet, and owning a large number of coins, the below chart is slightly confusing. StockCharts Since the middle of July, CleanSpark's price against that of Bitcoin has fallen 54% . The share price has fallen about 56% from that point, meaning the entirety of the decline in the share price has been due to a valuation contraction against Bitcoin. I don't see any fundamental reason for this decline to have occurred based on the above discussion, although we do know that these valuation boom/bust cycles do occur from time to time. I cannot help but think this contraction is going to unwind at some point and that it will drive an upside in the stock. Finally, on the valuation front, this is the same chart of CleanSpark's share price against that of Bitcoin, but for five years to give us a long-term perspective. StockCharts I've put a line where the ratio stands today, and we can see that for nearly all of the last five years, CleanSpark's valuation against Bitcoin has been much higher than it is today. Does that guarantee we will get a higher share price? Obviously not. However, does it put the odds in the favor of the bulls? I believe it does. The stock is still a long candidate If we wrap all of this up, I see a stock with an extremely attractive valuation, but also very high short interest. The ~$15 level on the price chart will be tough to get through if/when the stock gets there, but at under $9 today, there's a lot of room between here and there. On the downside, we have support near $7 and $8, so we'll see if that holds. The company's scale in an industry where scale is absolutely critical is a plus point for the bulls. I also believe the valuation as measured by the share price against Bitcoin is a big plus for those that are bullish. We'll see what happens, but if I'm right about Bitcoin breaking out of its bull flag, and that CleanSpark's valuation has much more upside potential than downside from here, we could see CleanSpark produce some pretty spectacular returns from this point. I'm reiterating a Strong Buy, but keep in mind this one is very volatile and not suitable for all risk tolerances.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724774-cleanspark-extremely-compelling-valuation-drives-bull-case?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34267106.jpeg

Grayscale’s has started a new fund which offers exposure to Aave's AAVE token, the asset manager said on Thursday, in what has been a series of novel products from the crypto asset manager.  Aave is a decentralized lending platform based on the Ethereum blockchain that offers automated loans of cryptocurrency using other tokens you own as collateral. It also lets users lend out their crypto to earn interest.  While the platform’s native token stands at a market capitalization of $2.3 billion, a relatively small number compared to most well-known tokens, the protocol has become the largest cryptocurrency lending protocol by total value locked (TVL), according to data by DeFiLlama.  “Grayscale Aave Trust gives investors exposure to a protocol with the potential to revolutionize traditional finance,” Grayscale’s head of product and research, Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, said in a statement.  “By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, Aave's decentralized platform aims to optimize lending and borrowing while removing intermediaries and reducing reliance on human judgment,” she said.  The launch comes only a few weeks after Grayscale rolled out its most recent fund, the Grayscale Avalanche Trust, offering investors exposure to the AVAX {{AVAX}} token. The asset manager currently offers over 20 different crypto investment products, a number that has grown after the launch of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January, which spurred interest for publicly tradable products tracking cryptocurrencies.

34266321,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646046,1727958626,Is This Bitcoin’s Last Big Drop? Expert Points To Key Indicator,"In his latest video analysis titled “BITCOIN’S One Indicator Signaling LAST Major Dip,” Dan Gambardello, a noted crypto analyst with 370,000 subscribers on YouTube, delves into the latest price action of Bitcoin to forecast what could potentially be the final major dip. After dropping as low as $60,000 on Wednesday, the fear of another deeper price crash has grabbed the Bitcoin market. Why This Could Be The Final Leg Down For Bitcoin Gambardello emphasizes the significance of the daily and six-hour charts. On the daily chart, Bitcoin is currently testing the 50-day moving average, a level that often serves as a litmus test for short-term market sentiment. However, the analyst’s main focus is on the six-hour chart’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator used to measure the speed and change of price movements, which has hit oversold levels. According to Gambardello, the RSI reaching oversold territory is traditionally viewed as a bullish signal, potentially indicating an approaching end to the current price dip. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Skyrocket To $118,000 By Year-End: Here’s Why “The bottom is actually, I think, close. There could be some type of capitulation in the very short term, but I think there could be a very strong bounce after that happens,” Gambardello noted, suggesting that despite the immediate market turmoil following the Israel-Iran conflict news, the fundamentals point towards an eventual robust recovery. Via X, Gambardello added, “Nothing like a 6 hour oversold RSI at the beginning of bull season. Also great during bull season.” This assertion is grounded in his analysis of past market behaviors during similar conditions, reinforcing the cyclical nature of Bitcoin’s market dynamics. Drawing parallels to historical data, Gambardello highlights the behavioral trends of Bitcoin in previous Octobers, noting a pattern of initial declines followed by strong recoveries by the end of the month. “October will close green. It’s always [like this] with the dip. People are just freaking out. I guess that’s it, but this gives us a little time. We’re getting all these red candles going into October, give us another week, maybe even two and we could get a pump, a breakout to the upside to end October,” Gambardello claims. Related Reading: Will Israel-Iran Conflict Push Bitcoin Further Down? Analysts Discuss Further deepening the analysis, Gambardello discusses the potential scenarios around Bitcoin’s lower trend line, a recurrent support level over the past six months. He speculates that if Bitcoin approaches this trend line again, it could effectively serve as a robust support level, potentially marking the last significant downturn before a sustained upward trend. Notably, one final touch of the trendline could bring down the BTC price as low as $50,000. However, Gambardello thinks that this is a less likely scenario as the 6-hour RSI has already hit oversold territory while BTC is currently bouncing off the 50-day moving average. Moreover, Gambardello refers to Bitcoin’s performance in past halving years, which are typically followed by bull markets, as seen in 2016 and 2020. Gambardello suggests that the current year could follow a similar trajectory. “This is a Halving year. We’ve seen what’s happened in Halving years in 2020 and 2016 in October. Is it going to repeat?” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $60,899.

A subcommittee of the CFTC moved its recommendations to the full committee but the recommendations are not yet known.  The likes of BlackRock and Franklin Templeton could see tokenized shares of their money-market funds pledged in trading after a major group under the aegis of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved guidelines for their use, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.  A subcommittee of the CFTC’s Global Markets Advisory Committee voted to pass the recommendations on to the full committee, which is expected to vote on the recommendations later this year, the report said citing two people familiar with the matter.  The report did not reveal what the recommendations were but the mere action that they have been sent to the full committee could be seen as the next step.  The CFTC did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.  BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) is an example of how creating blockchain-based tokens of traditional investments such as bonds and funds is a fast-growing use case for the larger digital asset space. The BUIDL fund became the largest tokenized Treasury fund just six weeks after its late launch in March. It surpassed $500 million market value in July.

34266498,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24251,1727957599,What is Maneki (MANEKI)?,"Maneki is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain inspired by the Japanese beckoning cat, or maneki-neko, a symbol of good fortune and prosperity in Japanese culture. Often seen in shops and businesses, the maneki-neko is believed to bring luck to its owner, depicted with one paw raised in a beckoning gesture. Solana has gained a reputation as a hub for meme coins, with popular tokens like Solama, Smog, Bonk, Fronk, Moonlana, and SolDoge leading the way in the ecosystem’s vibrant and playful culture. Now the Japanese beckoning cat has made its way into the crypto world through the MANEKI token, which seeks to embody the cat’s qualities of wisdom, success, and leadership, offering more than just a playful mascot but also an emblem of prosperity for its community. The maneki-neko is traditionally portrayed as a seated cat holding a koban coin, with either its left or right paw raised. The raised left paw is said to attract customers, while the right paw invites wealth. These cultural symbols align with the narrative surrounding MANEKI, positioning the token as one that not only represents luck but also aims to draw success and wealth to its holders. Much like its ceramic or plastic figurine counterpart found around the world, MANEKI seeks to serve as a digital talisman for fortune on the Solana blockchain. Maneki’s appeal extends beyond its symbolism, tying into the broader meme coin trend within the cryptocurrency space. However, unlike some other meme tokens that lack cultural depth, MANEKI draws on centuries of tradition, infusing its community with the rich folklore of the maneki-neko. This positions the token as not only a playful addition to the Solana ecosystem but also as one rooted in a narrative of positivity, success, and leadership that resonates with both cultural enthusiasts and crypto investors alike. As a meme coin, MANEKI leverages the familiarity of the beckoning cat to foster a sense of community and optimism within its user base. Its presence on the Solana blockchain aligns with the network’s growing ecosystem of fast, low-cost transactions, making MANEKI accessible to a broader audience. Whether it can bring prosperity like its traditional figurine counterpart remains to be seen, but the token undoubtedly captures the spirit of fortune and opportunity in the rapidly evolving Web3 space. trade maneki now What is the MANEKI Token? Launched on April 22, 2024, it quickly gained attention for its fair launch and transparent distribution. With no pre-sales or team-held tokens, Maneki ensured a level playing field for all participants, fostering a sense of community and fairness within its ecosystem. The total supply of 8,888,888,888 tokens was designed to be accessible, with 90% of the liquidity provision permanently burned, and the remaining 10% distributed to the community through airdrops. One of Maneki’s most notable achievements was its airdrop to Solana users who pre-ordered the “Chapter 2” mobile device , distributing over $20 million in tokens. This approach reinforced its focus on rewarding early supporters and growing its community. Despite being a meme coin with no inherent utility beyond its symbolism, Maneki has captured significant interest, with its market cap exceeding $260 million within 24 hours of its launch. Its rapid rise reflects the strong demand for unique digital assets in the crypto space, particularly those tied to cultural icons like the beckoning cat. Maneki also differentiates itself through its long-term vision, positioning itself as more than just a meme coin. The project has applied for global trademark protection under the Madrid Protocol , signalling its ambition to expand beyond the crypto world. Future plans include launching a manga and anime series , as well as real-world merchandise, aiming to build a globally recognisable brand. This strategy highlights Maneki’s desire to establish itself as a cultural phenomenon, blending traditional Japanese symbols with modern digital trends. In addition to its web3 presence, Maneki is making strides in the real world through sports sponsorships and mainstream marketing efforts. It became the first meme coin featured on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq billboards in Times Square, marking a historic moment for the project.

Iran’s air strikes on Israel, for which the latter has vowed to retaliate, continue to weigh on risk assets, such as bitcoin. Other major cryptos are nursing more significant losses than BTC with ether down over 4.5% at $2,350. The broader digital asset market as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index is around 4.2% lower. XRP is the worst affected, having dropped 11% after the SEC filed an appeal against the ruling in Ripple's favor over their long-standing legal dispute.  Despite the generally negative direction in crypto prices, whales are continuing to accumulate bitcoin at unprecedented rates, CryptoQuant founder Ki Young-Ju said in an X post. Whales colloquially refer to influential entities that hold largest amounts of any asset - and on-chain data shows new bitcoin whales are making sizable purchases in anticipation of a bull run ahead. ""Real whales move the market through spot trading and OTC markets,"" he wrote. ""That’s why on-chain data is crucial. The older whales haven’t seen particularly high returns, and the whales who entered in this recent bull run have barely made any profits.""  Tokyo-listed bitcoin holder Metaplanet Inc. is now using bitcoin options to boost its BTC stash. The company announced the sale of 223 contracts of bitcoin put options at the $62,000 strike with a maturity date of Dec. 27. The transaction involved Singapore-based QCP Capital as the counterparty and generated a premium of 23.972 BTC ($1.44 million). Metaplanet posted $13.826 million as margin collateral, with each contract offering a 0.1075 BTC premium, which Metaplanet received upfront. The transaction resulted in a nominal yield of 10.75% and an annualized yield of 45.63%. Metaplanet will use the premium received to purchase more bitcoin. The company’s total bitcoin holdings are worth around $32 million.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the BTC balance held by whales alongside bitcoin's price.  The increase in accumulation in recent months suggests new whales have yet to generate serious profit.  ""They are unlikely to dump on exchanges until liquidity from retail investors starts flowing in,"" CryptoQuant founder Ki Young-Ju wrote on X.

Loosening of monetary policy could help Bitcoin miners adapt faster to the post-halving landscape, which may stabilize the hash rate and profitability. Lower interest rates can also reduce miners' operating expenses, encouraging them to hold rather than sell Bitcoin, thus supporting higher asset prices. BITO offers a unique high-yield strategy through Bitcoin futures with a high dividend yield, despite share price volatility and income not increasing smoothly like for dividend growth ETFs. Capital appreciation is lower than for spot ETFs due to the income strategy, but dividends paid have tripled from 2023 to 2024, while there has been no capital erosion during this period. Since I last covered the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) on July 24, it has lost about 13%. At that time, I had a hold position based on the consolidation of the mining industry following the halving event. Still, I also mentioned that the Federal Reserve cutting rates would benefit the share price. This is indeed what happened since the beginning of September as charted below, as a result of the market beginning to price in a more dovish U.S. Central Bank, eventually culminating in a 50 basis point rate cut last week. Some impetus was also received by stimulus measures emanating from China. Data by YCharts This thesis aims to build a bullish case based firstly on how lower rates will benefit miners, as key stakeholders in the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ecosystem, namely to HODL more coins instead of selling them and pressurizing asset prices downwards. Second, there is the income rationale for an ETF that leverages the dynamics around Bitcoin futures contracts to generate juicy dividend yields. First, five months after halving, I provide an update on how the mining industry stands. The Post-Halving Landscape Shows Adjustment Continues Since the April 19 halving event, miners have faced challenges given the block reward was reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, putting pressure on profitability. In response, some have introduced new ASIC models or specialized hardware customized for cryptocurrency mining as part of a longer-term strategy of continually upgrading their hardware to become more energy efficient. Others have optimized existing computing machines through firmware (software) updates to produce more while using less KW of power. Looking further, some have migrated their operations to locations within the U.S. or in other parts of the world to benefit from lower energy costs, which helps them stay competitive in the face of lower rewards.​ To obtain an idea of how the industry has fared, it makes sense to study the evolution of the hash rate, which represents the total computational power in the Bitcoin network at any one time. As shown in the chart below, this metric has not maintained its progression after April, showing some miners have cut production because of higher operating expenses while others with weaker balance sheets have ceased production altogether or ended up being acquired as I explained in a previous article as part of the ongoing consolidation whereby smaller troubled players are being acquired by larger ones. Subsequently, July and August saw a slight reacceleration of the hash rate which at times exceeded the 720 million mark, but overall mining activity again decelerated from September. Data by YCharts This can be mainly attributed to two factors, the first being seasonal variations whereby in the summer months (July and August) mining farms can benefit from low-cost renewable energy, namely hydroelectricity due to higher rainfall. Logically, there was a drop in hash rate in September, accentuated by newer ASIC models coming online as more miners have been decommissioning older and less profitable equipment. Second, there is also Bitcoin's mining difficulty (above chart) to contend with, which is adjusted every two weeks (after every 2016 block) to prevent blocks from being mined too fast. The problem is the difficulty staying above the 85 mark despite the hash rate declining in June, which is abnormal and explained by the adjustment lag. This may be temporary but is enough to reduce miner profitability, with the situation made worse by Bitcoin's price not rising sustainably in the meantime. This resulted in some miners reducing participation (by stopping activity), bringing down the hash rate, which hints that the post-having adaptation is still ongoing. Lower Interest Rates Can Help Support Asset Prices Thus, in the current landscape, mining has become more difficult and the activity is less rewarding (profitable). Now, this can change, but not necessarily through higher asset prices or lowering the mining difficulty. Another option is to lower the operating expenses​, enabled by lower rates. Looking deeper, this can take the form of lower interest payments on loans offsetting some of the effects of higher electricity costs, which constitute a significant portion of mining costs given Bitcoin production accounts for about 0.5% of global energy consumption. Additionally, with lower borrowing costs, there are more refinancing options that can provide miners with financial relief, crucial to navigating the current high-competition environment where they have to compete harder to validate a block while earning less in the process. Thus, lower rates should contribute to mining operations remaining viable without having to offload (sell) the Bitcoins produced. Subsequently, by HODLing more Bitcoins (than selling on the open market), supply gets reduced, in turn, supporting the value of the cryptocurrency. Two other factors that can help are inflation having been brought down below 2.5%, which helps businesses in general to reduce costs, and massive stimulus by the Chinese government. Therefore, more favorable monetary policy on both sides of the Pacific Ocean could trigger a rally in crypto prices as broader risk-on sentiment emerges. In this case, learning from 2020 when the U.S. federal funds effective rate was drastically lowered, BTC climbed by around 80% ($5K to $9K) as per the chart below. Data by YCharts However, at that time, monetary conditions were less tight as the Fed fund rates were lowered from 1.58% in February to 0.60% in April, while today, they remain at 5% despite the cuts. Also, according to Mr. Powell, there is no preset course for future cuts, meaning rates will remain on the higher side for the foreseeable future. In the same vein, the above chart shows no sustained upside in BTC in the immediate aftermath of the Fed cutting rates, meaning that volatility is likely to persist as miners continue to adjust operations. Thus, considering the above risks, I have a modest target of $71.4K for BTC or its highest resistance level post-halving. This would mean a return of 18.2% from the $60.4K at the time of writing. Now, considering that as a Bitcoin-linked ETF, BITO's value depends on BTC as shown below, it could reproduce this return resulting in the ETF rising to $20.6 (17.4 x 1.182) based on its current share price of $17.4. ProShares To justify this bullish posture, there is BITO's income rationale. Annual Income Has Surged By More Than Three Times Amid Volatility For this purpose, based on the dividend history on Seeking Alpha, and except for Jan 2024 as shown in the table below, the fund managers at ProShares have been paying dividends regularly since February 2023. Still, this does not qualify for consistency because the amount paid has not increased gradually as for dividend growth funds. Along the same lines, BITO does not guarantee fixed returns on capital since yields can fluctuate widely based on the performance of Bitcoin futures, the fund's underlying asset, and the way ProShares calculates dividends. For clarification purposes, BITO is futures-based, signifying it does not hold actual Bitcoins but trades in futures contracts which indirectly provides price exposure to Bitcoin. In short, there are risks of not getting paid and one should not expect stable income. Table built using data from Seeking Alpha Shifting to a positive tone, its strategy to capitalize on Bitcoin futures has delivered on the income front, as it offers a forward dividend yield of 66% , but this can change rapidly depending on the share price. Still, in practice, this has translated into payouts of $3.1 in 2023 and $9.84 until September this year as shown above, which totals nearly $13. Therefore, for income seekers who are ready to embrace this rather unique way of capitalizing on crypto while facing volatility, BITO's high-yield strategy is appropriate. As an example, someone who had bought the shares in January 2023 at $10.59 each would already have enjoyed capital gains of $8 in September this year as illustrated below while netting dividend gains of $13. This means total gains of nearly $21 or nearly two times the amount invested within 21 months. Table built using data from Seeking Alpha However, on the cautious side, its share price has fluctuated widely, and the income provided isn't necessarily guaranteed for the future. For this purpose, BITO did not start paying dividends right after it was incepted in November 2021, but only as of February 2023. Therefore, someone who had invested in November 2021 would have suffered from a capital loss of $23.24 as shown above, which is significant and is only partially offset by the income of around $13. Fewer Capital Gains Compared To A Spot ETF But Has Still Appreciated While Generating Income Consequently, for those holding BITO's shares, one solution is to adopt an averaging down strategy and buy at current prices. The reason is BITO's unique approach consisting of managing (buying and selling) futures to derive monthly distributions from the profits earned has resulted in dividends rising sharply from 2023 to September 2024 (on an annual basis). Moreover, it does not offer the same level of capital appreciation when compared to the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) as shown below because of the roll costs associated with making profits by continuously purchasing longer-term contracts and selling short-term ones. Also, it charges fees of 0.95%, compared to 0.12% for IBIT. Data by YCharts Still, despite paying three times more dividends from January to September 2024 than in 2023, BITO's current share price of $17.14 remains well above (or around 64%) its January 2023 share price of $10.59. Therefore, its strategy of regularly paying dividends has not resulted in its price decaying over time, like for some options trading strategies. On the contrary, during the past 20 months (February 2023 to September 2024), BITO's income strategy has delivered significant value while also offering price appreciation, all amid Bitcoin volatility. Finally, while there are volatility risks associated with investing in anything related to crypto as miners continue to adjust to the post-halving landscape, a more dovish monetary policy should prove helpful to support the mining ecosystem and reduce the likelihood of miner capitulation or selling their Bitcoin reserves to cover their costs resulting in asset prices becoming under pressure.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724751-bito-etf-rate-cuts-are-beneficial-plus-high-income-proshares-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34265093.jpeg

34263767,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646036,1727953207,"What’s Holding Bitcoin Back? Analyst Says $71,000 Is The Magic Number","Veteran trader Peter Brandt believes that the recent rally of Bitcoin still isn’t enough to flip the long-term bearish trend. While BTC did have a brief surge, he insists it hasn’t reached the levels needed to confirm a bullish reversal. Bitcoin needs to break $71,000 first and then confirm that, says Brandt. And while he claims this, other market analysts such as Jesse Colombo and Roman warn that geopolitical tensions and market patterns might bring BTC down even further. Related Reading: Breakout Looms: XRP To Hit $7.5 After ‘Wake-Up Line,’ According To Analyst QCP Capital highlights cautious optimism, noting that the recent sell-off appears shallow, suggesting potential for recovery. As more major traders take time to think about it, Michal van de Poppe thinks this pullback is short-term and would look forward to a retest of $60,000 support before Bitcoin makes a strong rebound. For more than seven months now, Bitcoin has traded in a downtrend with consecutive lower highs and lower lows reinforcing bearish sentiment. Even though the short-lived optimism had some toe-hold moments, according to Brandt’s chart work, the larger pattern isn’t altered. BTC must break through the higher levels of resistance at hand before a shift to the bullish side can be seen. Resistance Levels Holding Bitcoin Back According to Brandt, Bitcoin is caught between two very important levels of resistance. The first is at $70,600, while the second and the all-time high of Bitcoin is at $73,800. Both marks have capped the upward movement repeatedly, and thus, they are a must for Bitcoin’s next major move. Since Bitcoin is unlikely to convincingly break above $71,000, the asset is likely going to stay in its current consolidation scenario, Brandt believes. The recent rally in Bitcoin did NOT disturb the 7-month sequence of lower highs and lower lows. $BTC Only a close above 71,000 confirmed by a new ATH will indicate that the trend from the Nov 2022 low remains in force pic.twitter.com/lFO9A20VPD — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) October 2, 2024 Roman is also one of the very popular crypto traders with a similar opinion. He noticed that any increases in volume along with price drops usually prove to confirm a strong downtrend. Roman believes that Bitcoin will test the $55,000-$57,000 range before any hope of reversal, which again puts emphasis on struggling to break through at those resistance levels. Moving Averages And Market Uncertainty Bitcoin’s 8-week simple moving average (SMA) has been residing at a level of around $60,526 and has served as resistance recently on the price charts. The price of BTC has hung off that line for a while, which indicates the fact that market participants haven’t really decided if they are buying or selling. It hasn’t traded too low below it to find good strength in order to move up either. For volatility, the Average True Range of Bitcoin is at 5,756. That’s a relatively small level of volatility within the market. That only means the market can generate large moves, but hasn’t built an extreme level of volatility just yet. Dealers are watching closely for these indicators because they could signal where Bitcoin will break next. Geopolitics Tensions And Market Sentiment The Middle East tension is yet another strain in the cryptocurrency market. Of course, Bitcoin has started to surge in volatility alongside growing concerns of global instability. The price of Bitcoin over the last 24 hours has gone down by 3% to reach $61,380. Actually, that fall was part of the general sell-off among cryptocurrencies within which the entire market capitalization went down by 7.6% over two days. Bitcoin and crypto always tank when there are geopolitical fears, unlike precious metals. That confirms my long-held belief that crypto is not a safe-haven. It’s yet another risk asset just like high-flying tech stocks. $BTC $GLD pic.twitter.com/SBLgLgdpKB — Jesse Colombo (@TheBubbleBubble) October 1, 2024 According to Jesse Colombo, a well-known market analyst, Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies, usually worsen during periods of geopolitical instability. As he points out: “Bitcoin and crypto always tank when there are geopolitical fears, unlike precious metals.” The history was mainly the same with Bitcoin when global tensions reached their peak. It would appear the current market is no different from this historical precedent. Related Reading: Could XRP See A 360% Surge By Christmas? Experts Think So QCP Capital remains optimistic, despite the bearish sentiment that pours out from some corners. This is a token of positivity: sell-offs from a few days ago appear shallow, and one might expect investors to remain interested in risker assets, such as Bitcoin. Similarly, Michal van de Poppe predicts a retest of the $60,000 support level, suggesting the market could reverse course if that level holds.

42407470,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZI7bA,1727949043,Bitcoin Holder Metaplanet Sells BTC Options to Boost  Coin Stash,"Metaplanet sold 223 contracts of bitcoin put options, earning 23.972 BTC ($1.44 million) in premium income.  The options expire on Dec. 27 2024 with a strike price of $62,000.  If bitcoin falls below $62,000, Metaplanet will have to acquire an additional 223 BTC while keeping the premium income.  Tokyo-listed bitcoin holder Metaplanet Inc. is now using bitcoin {{BTC}} options to boost its coin stash, diverging from its peer, the U.S.-listed Microstrategy's debt-fueled accumulation strategy.  On Tuesday, Metaplanet announced the sale of 223 contracts of bitcoin put options at the $62,000 strike with a maturity date of Dec. 27. The transaction involved Singapore-based QCP Capital as the counterparty and generated a premium of 23.972 BTC ($1.44 million). CoinDesk reached out to QCP Capital for a comment.  Metaplanet posted $13.826 million as margin collateral, with each contract offering a 0.1075 BTC premium, which Metaplanet received upfront. The transaction resulted in a nominal yield of 10.75% and an annualized yield of 45.63%.  The $13.826 million of margin collateral came from the proceeds raised during Metaplanet's eleventh stock acquisition rights exercise. The purpose of this collateral is to ensure Metaplanet can meet the transaction if the option is exercised.  Strategic selling of puts  Metaplanet will use the premium received by selling put options to purchase more bitcoin. The company’s total bitcoin holdings now stand at 530.717 BTC ($32 million).  A put option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at a preset price on or before a specific date. Metaplanet is a put seller, meaning it is obligated to buy BTC at the strike price of $62,000, even if prices are lower on the day of the expiry.  If bitcoin's price drops below $62,000 by the maturity date, the buyer will likely exercise this option, forcing Metaplanet to buy 223 bitcoin at the higher strike price. Therefore Metaplanet's bitcoin holdings would increase by 223 bitcoin, even if the market price by Dec. 27 is lower, however the premium partially offsets the spot price risk.  If bitcoin's price is higher than $62,000 by Dec.27, the buyer is unlikely to exercise the option since they can sell bitcoin on the open market at a higher price. The option would therefore expire worthless, while Metaplanet keeps the 23.972 BTC premium as profit.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/03/bitcoin-holder-metaplanet-sells-btc-options-to-boost-its-32m-btc-stash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/02ce7b691cfdb4df2ee5d80e39200097510c745d-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Even with Dogecoin sitting more than 85% below its May 2021 all-time high of $0.73, expectations for the meme coin’s performance are still very high. Given its historical performance, the DOGE price usually gets a window of opportunity for a surge, and it seems like another window is finally opening up. The Bullish Thesis For Dogecoin Crypto trader and analyst Dima James Potts took to the X platform to share a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price. The analyst’s forecast takes into account a number of factors, ranging from historical performance to adoption. Nevertheless, the end result remains the same and that is the fact that the DOGE price could be set to surge. Related Reading: Still Holding Your Hamster Kombat Tokens? You Might Be In For A Nice Surprise Soon Potts compared the current movement of the Dogecoin price to that of 2017 and 2020 to reveal a bullish trend. As the analyst explains, each time, before the Dogecoin price rallied, it broke above the white line and then closed the week above it, as shown in the image below: Each time this happened, the DOGE price went on a parabolic run, and now, once again, the Dogecoin price has broken above the white line. This is bullish for the price, according to the analyst, serving as confirmation. However, the second part of this trend is yet to be completed and that is closing the week above the white line. Since the breakout occurred on Sunday, the DOGE price still has the rest of the week to complete this move. The breakout is, however, not the only reason that Potts is bullish on the Dogecoin price. He also points to the increased adoption and low price as reasons why the price could rise to new highs. Also, with more technological updates that provide for faster transactions and higher levels of security, the analyst believes that this “could further bolster Dogecoin’s utility and appeal.” A Possible 11,000% Surge? Taking into account the previous Dogecoin rallies and how they have played out, the analyst pointed out that each rally is more significant than the last. For example, there was a 9,300% surge in 2017 and a 29,000% surge in 2020/2021. Going by this, the analyst believes that the DOGE price could also see a significant rally this time around. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Is In The ‘Final Test’, Here’s Where The BTC Price Is Headed Next The bottom of the rally is place at around 11,167%, which would put the price above $10. Meanwhile, the top of the Dogecoin rally in the best case scenario is placed at 40,137%, putting the DOGE price as high as $40.

Crypto Market Remains Well Bid For Risk Assets Despite Iran launching over 180 missiles toward Israel yesterday, the sell-off in traditional financial (TradFi) assets was relatively muted. The S&P 500 closed 1% lower, while U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices rose 2%. In contrast, the digital assets market was hit relatively harder, with Bitcoin (BTC) sliding more than 5% following Iran’s attack. The total crypto market cap eroded over 6% in value while liquidations surpassed $550 million in the past 24 hours, data from CoinGlass indicates. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Falls To $60K: Is A Rebound Possible? In the report, QCP Capital says that the premier cryptocurrency seems to have found strong support at the $60k level. However, the firm cautions that further escalation in the Middle East might force BTC to drop to $55k. Regarding the market sell-off witnessed yesterday, the trading firm stated: Middle East geopolitics will steal the limelight for now, but the shallow sell-off suggests that the market remains well bid for risk assets. This minor setback shouldn’t distract from the bigger picture. The report also remarked that China’s recent economic policy actions are similar to those of Japan in the 1990s. Notably, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) tackled deflation by reducing interest rates, introducing negative interest rates, and starting the quantitative easing program. The report added: The flush of liquidity from the PBoC and potential fiscal support will likely support asset prices in China, with bullish sentiment potentially spilling over globally to support risk assets, including crypto. Additionally, the report pointed to the US Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell’s recent dovish remarks at the National Association for Business Economics, signaling further interest rate cuts in 2024. For context, the Fed cut rates for the first time in 4 years on September 18. Subsequently, financial markets worldwide experienced a surge in the price of risk-on assets, such as stocks and cryptocurrencies. The report concluded that “asset prices are expected to remain supported heading into 2025”, buoyed by aggressive interest rate cuts by both the largest (Fed) and third largest (People’s Bank of China) central banks in the world. What To Expect From Bitcoin In Q4 2024? Although the Iran-Israel conflict directly impacted BTC’s price, crypto analysts remain optimistic about a potentially strong Q4 2024. One analyst suggested that the recent dip could represent BTC’s “quarterly low.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Starts October In The Red After Crash To $61,000, Is ‘Uptober’ A Myth? Another crypto analyst Eric Crown opined that BTC could reach new all-time-high (ATH) value in Q4 2024, basing his analysis on the cryptocurrency’s historical performance in the months following September.

XRP's call-put skew shows fears of an extended price drop.  XRP's {{XRP}} options market shows a greater risk of an extended price decline than renewed gains as renewed regulatory uncertainty overshadows Bitwise's ETF filing and weighs over the cryptocurrency's price.  On Monday, asset manager Bitwise submitted an S-1 form to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), filing for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that would invest in XRP. Bitcoin and ether spot ETFs, which debuted in the U.S. early this year, have pulled in billions of dollars in investor money.  However, to the dismay of XRP bulls, Bitwise's action was quickly followed by the SEC filing a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, pushing back against Judge Analisa Torres's two-month-old ruling that fintech company Ripple Labs did not violate programmatic sales to retail exchanges did not violate securities rules.  Four years ago, the SEC charged Ripple with selling unregistered securities after the platform sold $1.3 billion worth of XRP. While Ripple is a fintech company dedicated to building a global payments network, XRP is an independent digital asset for online payments and currency swaps.  Being categorized as security is widely seen as a bearish development in the crypto market, as securities are more tightly regulated than commodities and demand greater reporting and transparency by companies.  As such, XRP has declined by 11% to 53.7 cents in the past 24 hours, taking the week-to-date loss to over 16%, according to data sources CoinDesk and Coingecko. It's the third worst-performing cryptocurrency among the top 100 coins by market value. Market leaders bitcoin and ether are down 0.5% and 3.7%, respectively.  Bearish options skew  Options traders on Deribit seem relatively more bearish on XRP than bitcoin and ether, according to the seven-day call-put skew, which measures the difference between call and put volatility (demand).  At press time, XRP's seven-day skew was -3.2%, a sign of bias for puts offering protection against price slides. BTC and ETH's seven-day skews were 0% or neutral and 2.8%, according to data source Amberdata.  Meanwhile, funding rates in the XRP perpetual futures market have turned positive, reversing the brief overnight negative flip, which represented a bearish bias.",NEGATIVE,BTC | XRP,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/03/xrps-bearish-skew-persists-after-10-price-slide-amid-sec-appeal-and-etf-filing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf6f2623c7a14da13eb40e5ed36666495d07df51-2880x1800.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42407477,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZI7rh,1727936447,Bitcoin Flat Near $61K as Whales Continue to Accumulate; XRP Down 10% as SEC Appeals Case,"Bitcoin remains relatively stable above $61,100, while ether experiences a 4% drop to $2,390 amid geopolitical tensions following Iranian airstrikes on Israel, influencing a broader market sell-off.  Despite the downturn, there's significant whale accumulation of Bitcoin, suggesting anticipation of a future bull run. Meanwhile, bitcoin ETFs see outflows, whereas ether ETFs attract inflows.  XRP drops over 10% after the SEC's decision to appeal a ruling on its regulatory powers over crypto markets.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} continued in the red at the start of Asian trading hours Thursday as the market withstood another sell-off.  BTC is flat, trading above $61,100, while ETH is down 4% and trading at $2,390. Crypto markets took a hit from Tuesday night after Irani airstrikes on Israel, which the latter has vowed to retaliate, in a move that has dented a rally in risk assets, including bitcoin.  However, whales continue to accumulate bitcoin at unprecedented rates despite the macro environment and market dullness, CryptoQuant founder Ki Young-Ju said in an X post.  Whales colloquially refer to influential entities that hold largest amounts of any asset - and on-chain data shows new bitcoin whales are making sizeable purchases in anticipation of a bull run ahead.  The CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a measure of the performance of the largest digital assets, was down over 3% as investors continue to sell most major cryptocurrencies.  Outflows from the BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continued with $91.76 million in outflow during the Wednesday U.S. trading day. Ether ETFs experienced the opposite, with inflows of $14.45 million, breaking a two-day streak of outflow.  XRP plunged more than 10% in the past 24 hours after the U.S. SEC said on Wednesday that it is appealing a court ruling restricting its ability to regulate cryptocurrency markets. The SEC will ask the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to review a July 2023 decision that the XRP token sold by Ripple Labs on public exchanges did not meet the legal definition of a security.  Memecoin mog (MOG), the second-largest cat-themed token behind popcat (POPCAT), saw little price movement after getting an automated mention from Republican candidate Donald Trump's X account. Trump's account seems to be sending a reply to any account that liked his tweet  A Polymarket market tracking Trump's mention of the word ""mog"" - or related adjectives - before December 31 was unchanged at 13% of ""yes"" votes, leading to some drama among voters.  Elsewhere in the market, LDO, the native token of non-custodial staking solution Lido, is down nearly 9%, following Ether's decline.  Artificial Intelligence tokens are also not moving, despite an announcement from OpenAI that it had raised $6.6 billion at a valuation of $157 billion.

Dogecoin May Be About To Show A Bullish MACD Crossover As explained by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, a MACD crossover could be about to happen for DOGE soon. The “Moving Average Convergence/Divergence” (MACD) is a technical analysis indicator momentum indicator tracking the difference between two Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) of an asset. The EMAs that the metric typically uses are the 26-period and the 12-period ones. The latter is subtracted from the former to get the indicator’s value and the line on which these values are plotted is known as the MACD line. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Leads Whale Frenzy: Large SHIB Transfers See Massive 360% Spike There is also another line relevant to the indicator called the signal line, which is just the nine-period EMA of the MACD line. The crossovers between these two lines can serve as buy or sell signals for the given asset. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst, which shows the trend in the MACD for the Dogecoin weekly price over the past year or so: As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin MACD and its signal line have recently come close to touching each other. Currently, the signal line is above the MACD line, but if they continue in their recent trajectories, then their arrangement could be reversed. A crossover of this type is generally considered a bullish sign. In the chart, Martinez has highlighted what happened the last two times that the DOGE weekly price witnessed this trend. “The last two times Dogecoin $DOGE had a MACD bullish crossover on the weekly chart, it rallied 90% and 180%, respectively,” notes the analyst. Given this trend, it’s possible that the meme coin could benefit from a price boost this time as well, should the crossover take place. In some other news, the DOGE Active Addresses have shot up to pretty high levels recently, as Martinez has pointed out in another X post. The “Active Addresses” indicator keeps track of the total amount of Dogecoin addresses that are taking part in some kind of transaction activity on the network every day. In the latest spike, the metric has reached a high of of 84,306, which is the highest that it has been in around six months. Thus, it would seem that users have been quite active with their trades recently. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hype Bites Back As BTC Crashes Under $64,000 From the chart, it’s apparent that the trigger for the spike has been the plunge that DOGE has witnessed recently. Investors generally make panic moves when volatility occurs, so this trend isn’t too unusual. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.105, down almost 4% over the past week.

There is a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.3480 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it stays below the $0.360 resistance zone. Cardano Price Dips Again After testing the $0.4150 resistance, Cardano struggled to continue higher. ADA formed a short-term top and started a fresh decline like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move below the $0.3850 and $0.3650 support levels. The price even declined below $0.350 before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $0.3360 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor move above the $0.3420 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3853 swing high to the $0.3360 low. Cardano price is now trading below $0.360 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.3500 zone. There is also a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.3480 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The first resistance is near $0.360 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3853 swing high to the $0.3360 low. The next key resistance might be $0.3740. If there is a close above the $0.3740 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.400 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.4150. More Downsides in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.3500 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.340 level. The next major support is near the $0.3350 level. A downside break below the $0.3350 level could open the doors for a test of $0.3220. The next major support is near the $0.300 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.

The flagship crypto saw a 7% decline, fueling a bearish sentiment among investors. However, most analysts remain optimistic about BTC’s performance in the next three months. Related Reading: Bonk ‘In Prime Position For Turbo Green Week’ As Price Recovers Key Level Is This The ‘Shakeout Before Breakout’? The market began the month of October, popularly known as “Uptober” by the crypto community, with the first shakeout of the quarter, losing 6.5% of its market capitalization. Most cryptocurrencies in the top 100 saw a considerable price drop, registering green numbers in the daily and weekly timeframes. The bleeding was led by Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, as its price nosedived below the $61,000 support zone, a range not seen in nearly two weeks. Geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East seemingly fueled the downturn, as the drop followed the news of an Iranian missile strike on Israel. The news spiked an investors’ selloff, which ended the BTC spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) 8-day inflow streak and triggered the liquidation of over $526 million in leveraged positions in the last 24 hours. Nonetheless, many industry watchers remain unfazed by the market shakeout, noting that the month has just started. In a series of X posts, crypto analyst Jelle pointed out that Bitcoin started its second leg higher during October in the past bull years. He explained that BTC’s price historically breaks out in the second or third week of the month, so the first week retrace could be the “final shakeout before new highs.” Moreover, he highlighted that the flagship crypto recently made the first higher high in 6 months and reclaimed the key resistance level above $60,000. Jelle also noted that BTC made a higher low on October 1, holding the $60,000 support zone and retesting its strength above the $61,000 mark. The analyst considers that “It’s time for this descending broadening wedge to start playing out,” reasserting his previous target of $90,000. Analyst Warns About Bitcoin ‘Fifth-Day Plunge’ Other analysts also shared their views on the market shakeout. Altcoin Sherpa highlighted that “the last time we saw this much compression with 1d EMAs was September 2023, right before the market skyrocketed.” Meanwhile, DonAlt expressed a more cautious approach, stating that Bitcoin could look “much worse” considering the circumstances, but suggested waiting for the weekly close would be best to conclude. Nonetheless, trader Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that Bitcoin has “bottomed/topped at basically the same time” since June. Per the post, on the fifth day of each month, BTC’s price has registered a massive correction, except for September, when it occurred on the sixth day. Related Reading: SUI Sees 15% Weekly Surge Ahead Of Token Unlock, Can It Hit New ATH In October? During the Q3 retraces, BTC registered daily red candles ahead of the fifth-day plunge. The price recorded a 16.3%, 25%, and 11% decline in July, August, and September from the beginning of each month until the end of the first-week shakeout. If the pattern repeated this month, investors could see BTC’s price dropping below the recently reclaimed $60,000 support level and test the strengths of lower key support zones. However, it would also mean that the flagship cryptocurrency would potentially recover by the start of the second week. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $61,466, a 2% drop in the last 24 hours.

This action confirms the authenticity of its filing on September 30, following widespread speculation regarding the development. XRP ETF Applications Gain Momentum Despite this initial step, the road to approval is fraught with challenges. No XRP ETF is guaranteed to meet the SEC’s regulatory standards. Related Reading: Cardano Completes First Green September Close In 6 Years, What’s The Significance? Recent reports indicate that applications for ETFs linked to Solana, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency, were recently rescinded due to the SEC’s concerns about Solana’s legal standing. Nonetheless, Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise, expressed confidence in XRP’s potential as an investment opportunity. “XRP is one of the most enduring, well-known assets in the space and is also recognized among mainstream investors,” Horsley stated in an interview with Fox Business. He emphasized that Bitwise aims to help investors access opportunities in the cryptocurrency market, and the filing for a Bitwise XRP ETF aligns with that mission. In addition to Bitwise’s efforts, Fox Business has learned that another XRP ETF filing has emerged from Canary Capital, a newly formed crypto-focused investment firm founded by Steven McClurg, co-founder and former chief investment officer of Valkyrie Funds. Canary’s XRP ETF was filed on September 24. Implications Of SEC’s Ripple Lawsuit The regulatory status of XRP has been a contentious issue over the past years, particularly following the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple in 2020, claiming that XRP sales constituted what the agency calls “unregistered securities offerings.” A recent ruling provided Ripple a partial victory, determining that only certain sales—specifically to institutional investors—were classified as securities. This ruling has significant implications for XRP’s future, particularly as the SEC approaches its October 7 deadline to appeal. As reported by Bitcoinist earlier this week, Pro-XRP attorney Fred Rispoli has indicated that the likelihood of an SEC appeal is higher than the chance of the agency allowing the case to conclude without further action. Rispoli highlighted the stakes involved, noting that if the SEC chooses not to appeal, it could set a precedent that distinguishes Ripple’s case from future cryptocurrency sales. This could have wider implications, not only for Bitwise’s XRP ETF application but also for other institutions making similar moves to offer the same investment vehicles for the token. This could be similar to the newly launched Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETF markets, which were approved and launched in January and July this year, respectively, with the world’s largest asset managers offering these index funds to their clients, further supporting the adoption and investment in these cryptocurrencies. XRP Price Despite this notable development for the XRP market, its price has failed to follow the excitement generated among investors, as the token has followed the broader market’s decline with a 7% drop in the 24-hour time frame, resulting in a current trading price of $0.578. Related Reading: Will Israel-Iran Conflict Push Bitcoin Further Down? Analysts Discuss Despite this, the cryptocurrency is still managing to hold on to some of its gains from last month, up 5% over the period. However, XRP has only managed to gain 10% every year, highlighting the lack of catalysts and bullish momentum for further recovery. This is particularly evident in the gap between the current trading price and the all-time high of $3,040 reached in January 2018, leaving a difference of 82% from the record peak. However, a full victory for Ripple and other institutions to follow Bitwise’s initiative for an XRP ETF could have a noticeable impact on the price and perhaps renew investor confidence in the token, strengthening the bullish outlook for the rest of the year.

34246465,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645949,1727917240,Solana Posts More Net Inflows Than All Major Chains Combined: When Will SOL Break $160?,"Like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other top altcoins, Solana remains under immense selling pressure. While bulls struggle for momentum, $160 is emerging as a local resistance level for traders to watch out for. Despite the upside momentum in September, Solana buyers didn’t lift prices above this line. At press time, there is a local double top, even as one analyst on X notes that Solana outperformed other platforms, posting a sharp influx in net inflow. Solana Received Over $800 Million In Net Flows Over Three Months Unlike Ethereum, Solana is a modern blockchain with relatively high scalability. The platform can process thousands of transactions every second, translating to low fees, and thus, more projects are choosing to launch on the network so that user experience remains unaffected. Events over the last three months, looking at the influx of capital to Solana, cement this position. Related Reading: Bitcoin Starts October In The Red After Crash To $61,000, Is ‘Uptober’ A Myth? To put in the numbers, Solana registered over $800 million in net flows. This capital injection is more than double what OP Mainnet, an Ethereum layer-2, received and way more than what Sui, another scalable blockchain, posted in the last three months. It is also more than what Base and Starknet–two of Ethereum’s popular layer-2s, posted, and exceeds what Avalanche and the BNB Chain received. Interestingly, during this period, Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer-2 and the largest of them all, Linea, Blast, and Bitcoin saw outflows. Despite being the largest smart contracts platform, Ethereum posted massive outflows of nearly $800 million. It remains to be seen what could have triggered the outflows in Ethereum while encouraging capital to Solana. While on-chain fee differences could be a factor, the continuous dump of ETH in Q3 2024 could have triggered the outflow. At spot rates, ETH is down 35% from Q3 2024 highs, while Solana is just 25% from July highs when it rose to around $192 before pulling back. Will SOL Break $160? Even as Solana attracts capital, the coin remains under intense selling pressure. The local line at $160 needs to be convincingly broken for the uptrend seen in the second half of 2023 to continue. Further gains will see Solana float to as high as $190 and possibly break out from the current range. Related Reading: UNI Bullish Rebound Signals Upsurge, Targets $8.7 Resistance Ahead Nonetheless, there could be headwinds. If Bitcoin fails to recover, it could drag the altcoin markets, including Solana, with it. At the same time, there are concerns that the upcoming FTX token distribution would negatively impact SOL prices. Moreover, according to Token Unlocks, the team plans to release tokens on December 26, 2024. Over 66,000 SOL will go out every day for a year.

The appeal targets a July 2023 decision by US District Judge Analisa Torres, which determined that the XRP token, sold by Ripple Labs on public exchanges, does not qualify as a security under existing laws. SEC Appeals Court Ruling On XRP The implications of this ruling are substantial. Judge Torres stated that the approximately $757 million in XRP sales on public exchanges did not fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction, thereby exempting these transactions from the investor protection laws the agency enforces. Related Reading: Can SUI Break Past $2 Resistance? On-Chain Metrics Reveal Growing Demand If the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals upholds this interpretation, it could hinder the SEC’s ability to regulate other cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Coinbase, and challenge the agency’s oversight of newer financial products that do not fit traditional definitions. However, the ruling was not entirely favorable for Ripple. Torres also ruled that roughly $728 million of XRP sales to institutional investors should be classified as securities, requiring compliance with relevant laws. Ripple CEO Slams SEC’s Appeal The SEC had originally sought a hefty $2 billion fine against Ripple, but Torres ultimately imposed a $125 million penalty, which is currently on hold pending the outcome of the appeal. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Is In The ‘Final Test’, Here’s Where The BTC Price Is Headed Next Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expressed his frustration at the SEC’s decision to appeal, calling it “misguided” and “infuriating.” He emphasized that despite the ongoing legal challenges, the current legal status of XRP as a non-security is established: If Gensler and the SEC were rational, they would have moved on from this case long ago. It certainly hasn’t protected investors and instead has damaged the credibility and reputation of the SEC. While we’ll fight in court for as long as we need, let’s be clear: XRP’s status as a non-security is the law of the land today. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.5390, down 10% after the SEC appealed the judge’s ruling on Wednesday.
