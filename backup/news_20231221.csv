21647553,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566359,1703198803,Cosmos (ATOM) Elliott Wave Summary (2019 – 2023),"Cosmos ($ATOM) is the coin that powers the entire Cosmos ecosystem. It consists of a variety of projects from different spheres such as finance, decentralized exchanges (DEX), and cloud computing. The earliest price data I can find for $ATOM is from Kraken, starting in April 2019. Using this price data, the remainder of the article represents my best efforts to apply Elliott Wave Theory (EWT) to isolate its placement in market structures. I will assume that you have some knowledge of EWT to understand the terms, but I have also included a small glossary at the bottom for reference. EWT Summary Cosmos Price Data from Kraken | Source: ATOMUSD on tradingview.com. A link to the raw image since it might be hard to see all the details: https://www.tradingview.com/x/jIKwljmV. Cycle Wave 0 – Mar 2020 – $1.1151 Primary Wave 1 – $2.4794 Primary Wave 2 – $1.8482 (38.2% LFR) Primary Wave 3 – $32.2433 (3.618 LFE) Primary Wave 4 – $7.872 (50% LFR) Primary Wave 5 – $44.7383 (1.236 LFE) Cycle Wave 1 – Sep 2021 – $44.7383 Primary Wave A – $20.2221 (Contracting, Leading Diagonal) Primary Wave B – $33.2641 (Contracting Triangle) Primary Wave C – $5.5409 (Impulse) Cycle Wave 2 – Jun 2022 – $5.5409 (50% LFR) Primary Wave 1 – ONGOING Primary Wave 2 – TBA Primary Wave 3 – TBA Primary Wave 4 – TBA Primary Wave 5 – TBA Cycle Wave 3 – ONGOING Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin 2023 Bull Run Releases New Target Exploring Further EWT uses ratios to create price targets. The main target being the 1.618 LFE, however there are the minimum, lower, and much higher LFE’s to watch out for. For $ATOM we first need to find the beta multiple to scale the targets off of. This is accomplished by taking Wave 1 and dividing it by Wave 0. In this case for the Cycle Wave Degree it’s approximately 40.12. Then we raise this multiple to various numbers defined by EWT to create a table of targets. In order below are the LFE Price Targets: 0.618 – $54.26 1 – $222.3 1.236 – $531.3 1.618 – $2,176.84 Therefore, if we expect $ATOM to be a Diagonal then $54.26 – $222.3 is the preferred price box. If we are looking for the typical price box then it’s: $531.3 – $2,176.84. However, due to the nature of the next estimated bull run only the Intermediate Degree Wave 3 of the Cycle Wave 3 should play out. The next bull run is estimated by many traders and institutions to peak around late 2024 to early 2026. Benner Cycle Theory also puts a market peak around 2026. You can see the full layout for Benner’s Cycle Theory here. As such, the Intermediate Wave 1 and 2 are: $17.2656 and $6.17. The beta multiple for the Intermediate Degree is approximately 3.116. Then as we did for the Cycle Wave Degree the relevant typical price box is: $25.14 – $38.81. The higher price boxes are all above the ATH for $ATOM. The current price action for $ATOM is overwhelmingly bullish, so the higher price boxes are definitely a possibility. Cosmos Price Data from MEXC | Source: ATOMUSD on tradingview.com. A link to the raw image since it might be hard to see all the details: https://www.tradingview.com/x/FQhUSWST. Related Reading: When Is The Next Crypto Bull Run? Conclusion Given the next bull run peak for crypto is likely late 2024 to early 2026 the relevant LFEs to use for $ATOM are at the Intermediate Wave Degree . The typical price targets for the Intermediate Degree Wave 3 are $25.14 – $38.81. The price as I write is $11.3 so the next peak is a rough 2 to 3.5x from here. If the Wave 3 is heavily extended and possibly goes to the 2.618 or 3.618 LFE then a new ATH is possible. That would mean a minimum of a 4x from here to the next peak. The Primary Wave 1 of Cycle Wave 3 is likely due in late 2026 to 2030 using Fibonacci Time Ratios.

21647378,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566383,1703197857,Is Ethereum (ETH) Ready For A Monster Move In January 2024?,"In a recent post on X, Sassal, an independent Ethereum educator, is doubling down on Ethereum (ETH). The angel investor said that based on current market sentiment, there are signals that the “death of ETH” narrative is losing steam. This is a reason, in Sassal’s view, to buy even more ETH ahead of the expected bull run. Ethereum Bulls Confident, ETH Resistance At $2,400 With the bullish stance, the independent Ethereum educator appears to be convinced that Ethereum’s fundamentals are strong. More importantly, the analyst is confident that the network is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for protocols, including those offering decentralized finance (defi) and non-fungible token minting services. Related Reading: Renewed Hope For Crypto: 2023 Sets The Stage For A Monumental 2024 Thus far, Ethereum, despite the relatively sluggish performance compared to meme coins like BONK or PEPE, remains the second most valuable network only behind Bitcoin. From the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, the coin is within a bullish formation. The coin rallied by nearly 60%, topping at December 2023 at around $2,400 before pulling back to spot rates. Even with the cool-off, buyers still have the upper hand. When writing on December 12, ETH prices found support at the dynamic reaction line, the 20-day moving average. It is also trading above the $2,100 support line, marking July 2023 highs. Accordingly, it means the bullish breakout formation of early December 2023 is valid. This move could anchor optimistic buyers targeting $3,000 and even 2021 highs of around $5,000 in the days ahead. Network Is Upgrading: Will This Drive Prices Even Higher In January 2024? The likelihood of trend continuation in 2024 also stems from plans by the platform’s developers to enhance performance and scalability. With Ethereum 2.0 on, developers have been working on layer-2 scaling options like Arbitrum and Optimism to relieve the mainnet. However, going forward, on-chain scaling solutions like Sharding, where the network will be fragmented into units called “shards” that are interconnected, will be rolled out. Related Reading: Analyst Says Polygon (MATIC) On Brink Of Major Move, Here’s Why Echoing Sassal’s sentiment, another commentator on the X post noted that December and January have historically been “monster months” for Ethereum in previous bull markets. This suggests that even if Ethereum prices have not rallied by triple digits like some meme coins or even outperformed Solana (SOL), the coin could be poised for a significant price rally in the coming months. Still, how ETH prices will evolve in the upcoming sessions remains to be seen. As it is, $2,500 remains to be a key reaction point that if broken could trigger more demand.

Here’s What’s Driving The Growth,"Solana (SOL) is flying high at the moment, and from all indications, the crypto token has no intention of slowing down anytime soon as it eyes $100. This is no doubt feasible, considering the several bullish narratives that continue to build up in the Solana ecosystem. Interestingly, SOL recently surpassed XRP to become the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Solana DeFi 2.0 Is No Joke On December 16, the official X (formerly Twitter) account for Solana made a post where it stated that “Solana DeFi 2.0 is just getting started.” Indeed, SOL may be up to something as its DeFi ecosystem continues to garner steam. Data from DeFiLlama shows that Solana has been going head to head to Ethereum in terms of DEX volumes on the respective chains. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Ignore FUD, XRP Is Headed To $5.85 Solana recently surpassed Ethereum in 7-day DEX volume for the first time in history. SOL has seen about $9.03 Billion in trading volume across all the DEXs on the chain in the last seven days. At the same time, Ethereum saw $8.836 Billion. This is more impressive when you consider the fact that Ethereum houses the most prominent decentralized exchanges. With such liquidity flowing into the ecosystem, it is only a matter of time before SolaSOLna hits $100. Data from DeFi Llama also shows that many are doubling their stakes in the Solana ecosystem. At the time of writing, the Total Value Locked (TVL) on Solana stands at $1.20 billion, its highest level since last year. Much credit needs to be given to the protocols that continue to build on Solana. One of them happens to be the liquid staking protocol Jito, which has over $570 million locked on its protocol. The DeFi platform recently distributed $225 Million in airdrop to SOL users causing new money to flow into the ecosystem. SOL price breaks $88 | Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com Is SOL Coming For Ethereum? For a long time, Solana has been dubbed the “Ethereum Killer,” but that has never really materialized. The network has for a long time, suffered numerous outages, which made many assume that it could not match Ethereum. However, this time around, there is a growing belief that SOL is well-prepared to live up to the hype. It is worth mentioning that the Solana network has been 100% uptime since the last time it recorded a network outage in February this year. This is also more commendable considering the surge in network activity that Solana has experienced in recent times. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price In Trouble: Whale Transfers 85 Million DOGE To Robinhood If Solana is somehow able to put these outages in the past, there is no doubt that people could look to it as a better alternative to Ethereum. An increase in its utility will also undoubtedly increase SOL’s value.

At the time of writing, SOL is trading at around $86, up over 10% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42418994,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDB2z,1703189376,2023: A Critical Juncture for the Global Stablecoin Market,"In 2023, the global stablecoin market has witnessed a year of unprecedented developments, shaping the future of digital currencies. This year marks a significant shift, not only in technological adoption and innovation but also in the regulatory landscape that governs these digital assets.  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package. Yiannis Giokas is a senior director with Moody’s Analytics.  Navigating the complex regulatory terrain  The stablecoin market in 2023 has undergone a transformation, driven by significant advancements in regulation. Given that the U.S. is by far the primary market for stablecoins, the Financial Stability Board's (FSB) recommendations, advocating for comprehensive regulation and oversight of global stablecoin arrangements have proven to be a pivotal moment. These guidelines aim to foster a unified approach to managing stablecoins within the international financial system, highlighting their potential impact on global financial stability.  Elsewhere, the G-20 discussions earlier in the year revealed a split in perspectives, especially among emerging economies, over concerns about the disruptive potential of stablecoins on sovereign monetary policies. This led to calls for stringent regulatory frameworks, reflecting the need to balance financial innovation with national economic safeguards. In October, the G20 adopted a crypto roadmap to coordinate a global policy framework for crypto assets, including stablecoins, which will also take into consideration implications for emerging markets.  In the U.K., the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England (BoE) are working towards finalizing regulations by 2025, indicating a commitment to safely integrating stablecoins into the financial ecosystem. Similarly, the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation sets a high benchmark for stablecoin oversight, with specific capital and liquidity requirements for issuers.  The United States is also taking legislative strides with various proposals to regulate stablecoins. A comprehensive stablecoin regulatory framework positions Japan ahead of other jurisdictions. Singapore's Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has finalized its framework for single currency stablecoins, and Hong Kong is preparing to introduce a regulatory framework by the end of 2024.  A tumultuous year  It has been a rollercoaster year for the stablecoin market. It started with the announcement that U.S.-dollar backed Binance-branded BUSD would no longer be minted, nor supported into 2024, leading to a search for reliable alternatives.  Then major stablecoins including USDC and DAI experienced de-pegging events during a banking crisis in March, raising concerns about their reliability. Binance's endorsement of trueUSD (TUSD) and tether (USDT) maintaining their status as “trusted” stablecoins despite regulatory and transparency challenges, marked significant moments in the market's evolution.  It's clear that the stablecoin market is at a crucial juncture  Moody’s Analytics published a report that highlighted that large fiat-backed stablecoins depegged 600+ times in 2023, which futher encapsulated the volatility in the market.  Adoption in mainstream financial operations  This year, major companies like Visa, Mastercard and Checkout.com have embraced stablecoins for various applications. Visa expanded its stablecoin settlement capabilities and initiated pilot programs with Circle’s USDC using the Solana blockchain. Mastercard collaborated with Immersve to enable crypto payments in New Zealand and Australia.  Checkout.com launched a stablecoin settlement solution, offering merchants 24/7 settlement flexibility, even on weekends and holidays.  Looking ahead  As we navigate through 2023, it's clear that the stablecoin market is at a crucial juncture. The regulatory landscapes across the globe reflect a concerted effort to integrate stablecoins safely into the financial system. While these regulatory efforts vary in approach and scope, they share a common goal: harnessing the potential of stablecoins while mitigating associated risks.  Despite facing significant challenges, the market has shown resilience and adaptability. The evolution of stablecoins seems to be leaning towards enhanced regulatory compliance and a gradual shift towards more transparent, decentralized models. This promises a more secure and stable future for this crucial sector of the crypto economy.  This year has been pivotal for stablecoins, marked by a broader regulatory push aimed at ensuring their stability and security. Despite some challenges and market fluctuations, the uptake and integration of stablecoins into both the crypto ecosystem and traditional finance indicate their increasing importance and potential for continued growth and innovation.  As we move forward, the stablecoin market's trajectory points toward a future where these digital assets play an integral role in the broader financial landscape. In this regard, stablecoin issuers would be wise in 2024 to focus on transparency, risk management and putting in place proper controls in order to enhance trust and safeguards around the integrity of redemptions.",NEUTRAL,USDC | TUSD,ASIA | MARKET | REGULATION | USDC | TUSD,Yiannis Giokas ,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/21/2023-a-critical-juncture-for-the-global-stablecoin-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/40a405f4304de7b04bb0d6f3b92f96b9fa65eb6d-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

21645753,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566348,1703188825,Neon EVM Hits Record-High 730 TPS On Mainnet,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain technology, Neon EVM, a smart contract on Solana (SOL) has emerged as a frontrunner by introducing a landmark parallel processing architecture on its mainnet. This approach has enabled Neon EVM to achieve an increase in performance, scalability, and efficiency, according to a press release share with NewsBTC. Neon EVM Dominates Transaction Processing Neon EVM, the first parallel Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on mainnet, has achieved a record-breaking 730 Transactions Per Second (TPS) on its mainnet. Notably, this is the first time such high tps has been achieved on an EVM mainnet. Related Reading: Renewed Hope For Crypto: 2023 Sets The Stage For A Monumental 2024 The milestone was reached on December 16, 2023, when Neon EVM’s mainnet showcased its transaction processing capabilities. While many blockchains demonstrate high tps on testnets, Neon EVM’s has standout by improving its scalability. Neon EVM, which went live on the mainnet in July 2023, operates as a fully Ethereum-compatible environment on the Solana blockchain. Since its launch, Neon EVM has garnered investor interest, resulting in multiple listings on platforms such as ByBit, Crypto.com, and Gate.io. Given these developments, the utility token NEON has experienced remarkable growth, with its value surging from $0.67 to $1.45 in just three days, representing a 116% increase. Neon EVM’s success comes when there is growing interest in high-speed, parallelized processing blockchains. Currently, Neon EVM stands as the only parallel processing EVM live on the mainnet, showcasing its tps capabilities compared to other blockchain networks. Outshining Ethereum’s Transaction Speed The fundamental difference between Neon EVM and blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum lies in their transaction processing approach. While Bitcoin and Ethereum process transactions sequentially, Neon EVM allows for simultaneous processing of multiple transactions, facilitating increased throughput and reducing the likelihood of congestion during periods of high demand. In a notable comparison, Neon EVM’s parallel processing architecture outperformed the combined tps of the entire Ethereum ecosystem on December 16, as reported by L2Beat. The project’s commitment to Ethereum compatibility on the Solana blockchain and its high-speed transactions and low-cost benefits positions Neon EVM as an interesting project as a new Bull Cycle emerges. Layer 2 Scaling Solutions On The Rise Polygon, the layer 2 scaling solution that operates alongside the Ethereum blockchain, has also demonstrated its transaction processing speed capabilities. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Sandeep Nailwal, the founder of Polygon, shared notable statistics highlighting the network’s performance. According to Nailwal’s post, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) chain seamlessly handled over 16 million transactions in a single day, showcasing its scalability and efficiency. During the peak period, the Polygon PoS chain achieved a throughput of 255 tps. This figure is approximately 2-3 times higher than the combined throughput of the entire Ethereum ecosystem. Related Reading: XRP Whales Show Exchange Inflow Activity, Bad Sign For Price? Moreover, the validators on the Polygon network generated approximately 1 million in transaction fees in a single day, reflecting the network’s high level of activity. However, it is worth noting that gas fees experienced a spike during this period, which is a broader issue impacting the entire Ethereum ecosystem. In terms of rewards for validators, the block rewards on the Polygon network amounted to over 155,000 MATIC tokens. This translates to substantial revenue for validators, totaling around 1.2 million in a single day. These rewards incentivize validators and contribute to the overall security and stability of the PoS chain. The spike in transactions in both of these Layer-2 networks showcase the growing importance of scalability solutions.

21645084,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566340,1703185235,"Matrixport Foresees Bitcoin Hitting $50,000 Price Mark: Here’s When","Matrixport, a crypto financial services firm founded by Jihan Wu, former CEO of Bitmain has recently shared a summary that delves into its forecast for Bitcoin, predicting a significant surge in its price. Founded in 2019, Matrixport has been closely monitoring Bitcoin’s market dynamics and trends. Their recent analysis suggests a robust future for Bitcoin, particularly noting its potential to break the $50,000 barrier by 2024. Related Reading: Eyes On $50,000: Bitcoin Poised For Major Rally Amid Spot ETF Optimism – Analyst Spot ETF Approval Could Catapult Bitcoin Above $50,000 Matrixport bases its optimistic forecast on the anticipated approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January. This crucial regulatory nod is seen as a pivotal factor that could propel Bitcoin’s price to soar above $50,000. The summary draws a parallel to a previous significant moment in Bitcoin’s history – the launch of Bitcoin futures by the CME Group and CBOE in December 2017. That event marked a notable spike in Bitcoin’s price, pushing it to reach $20,000 for the first time. Matrixport expected the SEC to approve Bitcoin Spot ETFs in January and this should lift Bitcoin prices above $50,000 by the end of January 2024. TV commercials are being rolled out already from multiple ETF applicants, which will continue to support Bitcoin prices.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 21, 2023 Matrixport equates the potential impact of spot ETFs to this historical milestone, anticipating a similar, if not greater, market reaction. Industry Experts Echo Matrixport’s Optimism Matrixport is not alone in its bullish stance on Bitcoin’s prospects. Other industry experts and analysts have echoed similar predictions, especially in light of the probable approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. Michael van de Poppe, a prominent crypto analyst, recently suggested that Bitcoin is poised to reach the $47,000-$50,000 range soon. Van de Poppe, just like Matrixport, attributes this potential surge to the anticipated approval of spot BTC ETFs by leading financial entities like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Investment. Investment management firm VanEck also shares this sentiment, forecasting a substantial influx of funds into spot Bitcoin ETFs. They predict over $2.4 billion pouring into these spot ETFs in the first quarter of 2024 alone. VanEck’s report highlights a growing investor trend towards ‘hard money’ assets, which are less influenced by US authorities. Bitcoin, with its resilience and limited correlation to traditional financial markets, according to VanEck, stands out as a particularly attractive option for investors. VanEck analysts also hold a firm belief in Bitcoin’s market stability, projecting that its price will likely not fall below $30,000 in early 2024. This prediction is reinforced by another analyst, Ali, who has identified a robust support zone for Bitcoin between $37,150 and $38,360. Related Reading: Crypto Funds’ 11-Week Inflow Streak Snapped: Bitcoin Faces $33M Exodus As Altcoins Shine This range is backed by substantial buying activities from around 1.52 million addresses, accumulating approximately 534,000 BTC.

The initial growth spurt which some believed was temporary has proven to have more steam than expected, and now the network has reached a momentous milestone. Shibarium Crosses 150 Million Transactions After its initial launch, the Ethereum-based layer 2 network from the Shiba Inu team had seen a notable decline in usage. This would persist for a few months until the market began to pick back up in December again. Once this happened and the SHIB price was on a recovery trend, activity on the Shibarium network would go on to explode. Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Balances Drop Drastically, What This Means For ETH Price Presently, the network is celebrating one of its biggest achievements yet and that is the fact that more than 150 million transactions have now been processed on the blockchain. To put this growth rate in perspective, the total transactions processed on Shibarium on November 30 were approximately 4.8 million. However, two weeks later, on December 20, the cumulative total transactions that have been carried out on the network since launch has crossed 150 million. This jump in the total transactions represents an over 3,000% growth in less than 30 days. Furthermore, the daily transactions carried out on the network have increased drastically as well. It went from a daily average of around 40,000 transactions per day, to an average of 7 million daily transactions in the last three weeks. At the same time, active addresses on the network have been rising after going from an average of 500 daily to around 3,000 per day in December. But interestingly, transaction fees have remained low at this time, showing the ability of the network to handle periods of high loads. SHIB price maintains $0.00001 | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com Shiba Inu Price Could Jump To $0.00002 Off the back of the growth that the Shibarium network has seen, the Shiba Inu price could be looking toward another rally from here. This is because the increased activity on the network has put the Shiba Inu token on the radar of more investors as they flock around the team for updates. Related Reading: Finance Expert Says Explains Why XRP Is A Scam Crypto analyst Ali Martinez previously identified that SHIB had been trading in a descending parallel channel. The hope for an upside from there lies in a push toward $0.000011 and SHIB has been making that push. Over the last day, the meme coin has risen by 1.6% and is slowly making this push. If the current recovery trend carries on, then the SHIB price could break above $0.000011 this week which is expected to trigger a bull rally. The SHIB burns being carried out by the Shiba Inu team is another bullish event that could trigger a price rally. So far, around $170,000 worth of SHIB has been burned by the team with expectations of total burns reaching $1.2 million.

With spot ETF approvals widely expected in January and asset managers bidding against each other for BTC, the biggest winners may be MSTR shareholders. April's BTC halving event is yet another catalyst that should push the price of the top cryptocurrency to new highs in the not-too-distant future. As we approach the end of 2023, investors have enjoyed one of the most eye-popping short-term rallies in recent memory. After bottoming at 4,100 on October 27th, the S&P 500 has rallied over 16% in less than 8 weeks. This two-month performance, which has come essentially without any meaningful pullback whatsoever, has essentially helped erase the 2022 decline in the broad equity market. After such a magnificent end of the year rally for stock investors, those motivated to find rebalancing ideas for the new year may want to take a look at the setup for MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ). MicroStrategy The Company As a business, MicroStrategy is a somewhat unexciting software company. Though you'll find references to ""AI"" and cloud computing in MicroStrategy's investor presentations, the company's revenue peaked almost a decade ago. Data by YCharts Despite the lack of an observable growth story for MicroStrategy's underlying business, the company's quarterly revenue has consistently come in between $120 million and $135 million for the last several years. The stock price has been anything but consistent, however. And these wild swings in price are entirely due to the company's corporate treasury strategy. The Macro Strategy What makes MSTR shares so compelling and the reason why the company trades at 22x sales with a roughly $9 billion market cap is the amount of Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) it holds in its corporate treasury. At the end of October, MicroStrategy had 158.4k BTC. To put this in context, MicroStrategy has more BTC than every publicly traded Bitcoin mining stock combined. Q3 Earnings Presentation, Slide 16 (MicroStrategy) Using the current article submission price of $43k per coin, MicroStrategy's Bitcoin has a fair value of over $6.8 billion. Under the guidance of company founder, former CEO, and now Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy acquired this Bitcoin through numerous purchases over the last three years. The company's cost basis is $29.6k, meaning at current market prices, MicroStrategy's BTC position is up by about 45%. The important detail on this BTC acquisition is that the company has financed a large portion of these purchases through a mix of long-term, low interest debt and share issuance. Q3 Earnings Presentation, Slide 22 (MicroStrategy) MicroStrategy has $2.2 billion in long-term liabilities. The senior convertible notes aren't due until December 2025. From Saylor's perspective, it's unwise to save in a fiat currency that is perpetually debased when he can instead put the company's treasury in a liquid asset that doesn't suffer from dramatic supply inflation. If you're not a proponent of cryptocurrencies, you might hate this approach. Nevertheless, it's working. As far as Saylor is concerned, he has borrowed long in a currency that historically declines in value and used that debt to acquire an asset that has historically appreciated in value. BTC per Share (MicroStrategy, Author's Graphic/Calculations) And even as the company has issued new shares, the issuance has been largely accretive as the company's BTC per share figures have remained near 2021 levels. Frankly, it's a simple strategy and one of the key reasons why Saylor may actually pull this off is because interest rates were so low in 2021. Of course, Bitcoin has to hold up its end of the bargain. But there is a very compelling setup for Bitcoin in 2024 and I suspect MicroStrategy is going to be a big winner next year. A Perfect Storm For Bitcoin? I see BTC having almost a perfect storm heading into 2024. We have the widely expected approval of a spot ETF seemingly just weeks away. The investment demand for Bitcoin in recent months has been strong, and that may be a modest assessment: Crypto Weekly Investment Flows (CoinShares) There has been just under $1.9 billion in crypto asset inflows year to date. The majority of that positive net flow has come in the last few months and $1.7 billion of the total has gone to Bitcoin specifically. This recent surge in investor flows has helped propel the price of BTC from roughly $28k in mid-October to well over $40k now: Data by YCharts At the same time, the equity market continues to be overvalued by just about any historical metric one wants to choose. And before we've really even seen an economic slowdown manifest in the official data, the Federal Reserve is already signaling a pivot to rate cuts next year. A rational hypothesis in 2023 has been that higher real interest rates are a hindrance to risk assets; particularly assets like Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) or Bitcoin that serve as traditional system hedges. With rates having apparently peaked, Bitcoin remains highly interesting from a system hedge standpoint. BTC Block Reward (LookIntoBitcoin) Finally, the well-telegraphed block reward halving next year will likely be a significant catalyst in pushing the price of BTC higher if demand remains consistent. When the block reward is halved, there is less sell pressure from miners and it helps propel the price to new highs. Halving 11/28/2012 7/9/2016 5/11/2020 Price At Halving $12 $663 $8,740 100 Days Later $42 $609 $11,950 1 Year Later $964 $2,550 $56,753 1 Yr % 2,267% 310% 402% Source: StormGain Each of the previous halving cycles has resulted in a new all-time high within 8 to 12 months. Given Bitcoin's relative infancy during the first halving, that event may be more of an outlier. However, if we take the average 1-year returns following the 2016 and 2020 halvings and apply that average to the current BTC price, Bitcoin could theoretically be $152k by April of 2025. That said, there are plenty of risks to consider as well. Modeling the future based on historical data may not be prudent for Bitcoin at this juncture. As the asset matures, returns will diminish over time. There are other considerations as well. Civil War Brewing? Back in early February, I detailed what was happening with the Ordinals protocol. I hypothesized that, while silly, Ordinals may have the potential to fracture the Bitcoin community in the same way the block-size civil war did back in 2016 and 2017. Bitcoin Ordinals Inscriptions (Dune Analytics/dgtl_assets) In the nearly 11 months since that article, we have indeed seen Ordinals inscriptions maintain a level of stickiness that I think those opposed to their existence were hoping wouldn't persist. In short, Ordinals ""inscriptions"" are essentially NFTs that use Bitcoin's block space. These inscriptions have driven nearly $200 million in transaction fees this year. Which has been wonderful for Bitcoin miners but terrible for those who want low average transaction fees on the base layer. Lightning Nodes (LookIntoBitcoin) Higher fees have been damaging to the growth of the Lightning Network because opening channels have become prohibitively expensive. To this point, BTC-denominated capacity on Lightning peaked in July and active nodes peaked in Q1 of 2022. Again fees are great for miners post-halving, but they may not be great for initial onboarding users to L2 solutions like Lightning. This is theoretically a problem for MicroStrategy specifically because the company is working on enterprise solutions built on that network. Still, MSTR's value proposition at this juncture is simply the BTC in treasury. MSTR Is Arguably Better Than A Spot ETF At this point, I think it's generally understood that buying MSTR is essentially a leveraged bet on Bitcoin. The company has low-interest debt that it used to buy BTC. And assuming that BTC appreciates in value at a rate that exceeds the expense on that debt, it's a terrific corporate treasury strategy that should yield significant returns for equity holders. But with the impending approval of a spot ETF in the United States, is there any sense in longing MSTR rather than one of these new ETFs in 2024? Q3 Earnings Presentation, Slide 26 (MicroStrategy) For all intents and purposes, MSTR has essentially served as the US market's spot ETF already. Unlike Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) ( GBTC ), MSTR has no management fee and isn't a net seller of BTC to subsidize those fees. There is actually an interesting case to be made for simply longing MSTR before the ETFs come. First, the issuers are bidding against each other to buy the BTC at the best price they can. MicroStrategy's position is already well established and benefits from the investment inflows by other asset managers pushing up the value of the company's BTC stack. Data by YCharts We can actually see already that MSTR historically outperforms not only the underlying asset, but also the US futures ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) and the Canadian spot Purpose Bitcoin ETF ( BTCC:CA ). Data by YCharts While there have been moments in the past when MSTR sold off more aggressively than Bitcoin and each of the ETFs shown above, when BTC is rising, MSTR rises faster. I'll reiterate what I've said in previous Seeking Alpha articles where I cover Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related equities; the safest way to get exposure to Bitcoin is to simply buy and hold BTC directly off of an exchange. The asset is designed to not require custodial support. It's important to keep that in mind. MSTR introduces an additional element of risk than simply holding BTC directly and may not be right for everyone. But that risk comes with a better reward if the company's treasury strategy works as I believe it will. Closing Thoughts I'm bullish Bitcoin long term. I wouldn't be at all surprised if we see a mini-correction back below $40k before the halving. But I'd view any pullback as a short-term buying opportunity. There are a lot of advantages to buying MSTR over funds like GBTC or BITO. A final consideration is the short position in MSTR: Data by YCharts With over 2.8 million shares sold short, the squeeze potential in this name if Bitcoin continues to rise next year is significant. As I said from the beginning, MicroStrategy as a business is much less exciting than MicroStrategy's approach to treasury management. But because there is an underlying business that is largely uncorrelated to crypto, there is less risk in going long MSTR than there is in other BTC proxies like mining stocks. MicroStrategy doesn't have enormous asset depreciation and actually has a breakeven BTC price that is lower than most of the miners. MSTR is one of my favorite stocks for 2024.

42418993,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDAzt,1703179199,Ethereum Emerges as a Key Blockchain for Tokenized Real-World Assets,"Digital finance technologies hold a lot of transformative potential. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) – of which blockchain is the best known example – powers digital bond issuances that, in time, could lessen the need for intermediaries in the issuance process, thereby improving operational efficiency and potentially reducing costs. DLT also underlies tokenization of real world assets, which could increase accessibility of certain instruments.  However, to make these potential benefits a reality and gain wider adoption, in Moody’s view, DLT-based technologies and platforms will need to overcome several key hurdles, including a lack of interoperability and standardization among DLT systems, a lack of reliable digital cash options, regulatory uncertainty and technology risks.  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package.  In the last few months, an increasing number of institutions have begun to engage with permissionless blockchain via both pilot studies and real transactions. Many of these entities gravitate towards Ethereum, given its extensive ecosystem of applications and networks that have developed their own user base and product offering in the last few years. As an open-source public blockchain, Ethereum provides a blockchain base layer on top of which developers can build solutions for sharing data and value across other networks.  Ethereum’s flexible design and its multi-year plan for upgrades, including ones that will improve interoperability, have made it a popular platform for digital bond issuances. Large institutions such as the European Investment Bank have issued bonds on Ethereum, which was also the blockchain underlying a digital green bonds Moody’s rated in 2023, a €10 million senior unsecured digital green bond issued by Société Générale. Over time, in Moody’s view, public blockchain networks like Ethereum and traditional infrastructure will be more interlinked, which will enhance blockchains’ use cases, promoting industry growth.  Asset tokenization – converting an asset such as a fund, real estate or art into a digital token, making it storable and transferable using DLT – has been gaining ground in the past year. Total value of tokenized real world assets on public blockchains increased to $2 billion from $1 billion in the last 12 months, and Ethereum currently hosts the vast majority of it. One factor slowing the adoption of tokenization is a lack of a reliable form of digital cash, which has led market participants to settle transactions off-chain or use stablecoins.  Stablecoins, a cryptocurrency whose price is pegged to a reference asset, such as fiat currency, are a form of digital cash, but under stressed market conditions stablecoins have not always maintained their peg. However, two other forms of digital cash that could address the present vulnerabilities of stablecoins are tokenized bank deposits and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The development of tokenized bank deposits and CBDCs will continue to progress in 2024, in Moody’s view, although their degree of interaction with public blockchains is still unclear.  Legal clarity will also likely improve in 2024, in Moody’s view, as regulators progress in developing frameworks to support new digital assets and services, although not all regions are advancing at the same pace. Regions including the EU, Singapore and the UAE could all attract new investors as a result of new customer and investor protections and new licensing regimes for digital assets.

We are on the precipice of an exciting 2024 with a lot of news, activity and anticipation of spot bitcoin ETF approvals and potentially large influxes of capital into the space.  Thanks to Connor Farley from Truvius for writing about the 2024 crypto market outlook for advisors.  Happy reading.  – S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  2024 Crypto Market Outlook for Advisors  Financial advisors and their clients should prepare for a potential transformative leap forward for the crypto asset class in 2024. Significant advances in market structure in 2023 and deep industry innovation in the new year indicate that rapid institutional adoption, meaningfully improved advisor investment accessibility and bullish catalysts for asset prices (not just bitcoin) may lie ahead. Below, we provide a 2024 crypto outlook for investors seeking to diversify their overall asset mix and enact a thoughtful digital assets allocation plan.  2024 Crypto Market Outlook  Overview  When it comes to digital assets, advisors should ask themselves the following two questions: one, why crypto and two why now?  Lengthier answers exist for both, but the simple ones are, respectively:  1. Only a few of us have been around for the inception of a new asset class, particularly one uniquely powered by modern technology and in certain cases specifically programmed to combat the glut and frictions of traditional financial markets. Obtaining exposure to an alternative set of assets rooted in legitimate value – measurable by blockchain metrics – is a diversifying and generational opportunity.  2. The industry is transitioning from early adoption to mass adoption. A sea change in industry leadership, product development and fiduciary commitment swept crypto in 2023, enabling a new suite of increasingly institutional-grade on-ramps into the asset class.  Besides general industry trends, conspicuous catalysts in 2024 may also trigger rapid investor adoption of digital assets. These events include the potential (and seemingly likely)regulatory approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, theBitcoin halving scheduled for April 2024 (a once-every-four-years event that reduces the supply of new bitcoin), and adovish macroeconomic backdrop andslowing inflationary environment – each on their own a meaningful bullish nod for crypto, but together a potentially rare opportunity for portfolio positioning.  Crypto ≠ Bitcoin  With context in place for crypto as part of an overall asset allocation mix, we turn to considerations within the asset class.  From a traditional allocator’s standpoint, crypto has a lopsidedness problem. Two megacap assets – bitcoin and ether – dominate 70% of the market capitalization for digital assets. Well-supported investment theses exist for both assets, but it is criticalnot to overlook the fundamental value of blockchain-powered technologies driving new business sectors like decentralized financial services and smart contract platforms.  As advisors progress on their cryptolearning journey and position themselves for 2024, remaining open to the investment cases for other sectors is key. Just like crypto can be diversified to stocks and bonds, different crypto sectors can be diversified to each other (see Figures 1 and 2). Diversifying crypto exposure to encompass a broad range of investable assets reduces single-token concentration and grows investor expertise in the asset class and its value.  Figure 1: Quilt Chart of Sector Rankings by Monthly Performance (YTD as of Dec. 13, 2023)  Improved Market Structure  Moving from analysis to implementation, advisors should also consider the various methods of allocating to digital assets in the new year.  2023 marked a turning point for institutional readiness. Advances in qualified custody and new, thoughtful linkages between custodians and trading exchanges provide a more solid ground for advisors to plan their digital asset exposure. Reporting, tax statements and ease-of-use are coming into view, with U.S. crypto custodians honingcompliant RIA platforms to meet the needs of advisors. The next wave of market innovation will likely come from asset managers competing on intelligent exposure to crypto markets as the product adoption cycle moves frombasic passive exposure to sophisticated active exposure.  Perspective for Advisors in 2024  While multiple events point to potentially favorable conditions for crypto in the upcoming year, it is also critical to understand how crypto’s brief and volatile history has led to better, more durable options for investors.  Repeated industry failures in 2022 stigmatized the asset class, and mixed regulatory responses have blocked timely solutions by prominent traditional asset managers to help destigmatize it all, drawing focus away from the fundamental value of blockchain innovation and leaving investors scarred by fiduciary ignorance.  These events, however, have driven efforts by trained financial engineers, CFAs, and traditional asset managers to migrate legitimate investment solutions over from the traditional asset class world, with prominent “TradFi” figures now helming key crypto leadership positions at digital andtraditional asset management companies. These efforts crystallized more strongly in 2023 and appear to be trending faster in this direction.  Supported by sturdier industry infrastructure informed by lessons learned, advisors now have a better – but still nascent – array of investment education, product options and platforms not only to help avoid the pitfalls of early-adopter risk, but to exploit early-adopter premia in 2024.  – Connor Farley, CEO, Truvius  Ask an Expert  Q. Crypto has become more mainstream and sought after as a new asset class. What are some of the ways investors can access this new and exciting frontier market?  A. Many people who look to invest in digital assets come from a traditional financial markets background and are often surprised by the complexity and fundamental differences between the two. Crypto is a nuanced and highly fragmented market, with hundreds of centralized exchanges globally. Yet only about 20 capture significant volumes, and then about five get most of the trades. The largest exchanges with the deepest liquidity are based outside of the U.S. At the same time, there are just three relevant exchanges based in the U.S. Additionally, there are decentralized exchanges (DEX), which are peer-to-peer marketplaces where trades occur on a chain directly between crypto traders. Centralized exchanges run internal ledgers that balance positions across their clients. There are over-the-counter (OTC) desks that provide more white glove service to institutional investors.  Q. Given this complexity, what is a good way for investors to gain access to crypto strategies?  A. Within the web of this fragmented market are multitudes of trading strategies that offer yield generation, arbitrage opportunity (as all frontier markets do) and superior proxies to the major currencies like BTC and ETH. One way to access these opportunities is to find fund structures that manage the investing, such as classic hedge fund structures or asset management firms that create institutional-grade products using digital assets. There are innovative managed accounts platforms that allow investors access to many of these strategies in a more transparent, secure and controlled environment.  - Leo Mindyuk, CEO, ML Tech   Keep Reading  Blackrock’s latest filing with the SEC includes their stock ticker.

Polygon Whale Transactions Have Shot Up Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali has pointed out how the whales have shown a notable surge in activity on the MATIC network recently. The relevant indicator here is the “whale transaction count,” which keeps track of the total number of Polygon transfers happening on the blockchain that exceed a value of $100,000. When the value of this metric is high, it means that the a large amount of such transactions are taking place right now. Such a trend is a sign that the whale entities have an active interest in trading the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: XRP Whales Show Exchange Inflow Activity, Bad Sign For Price? On the other hand, the indicator being low implies the whales are potentially not paying much attention to the asset currently, as they aren’t making too many moves. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Polygon whale transaction count over the past month: The value of the metric appears to have been quite high in recent days | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the Polygon whale transaction count has observed a sharp rise in the last few days and has attained high levels not seen at any point during the past month. In the chart, Ali has also attached the data for another version of the metric that keeps track of only the MATIC transactions that are carrying a value of at least $1 million. These massive transactions are the ones more likely to move the market and it would appear that they have also gone up in number recently, implying that the whales haven’t been shy of moving around large stacks. “Such significant movements often signal impending price changes,” explains the analyst in the post. “So we could be on the brink of a major MATIC price move!” Any volatility that may arise of this high whale activity, however, could theoretically go in either direction, as the whale transaction count only tells us whether the whales are active or not, and doesn’t contain any info about whether buying or selling is dominant. Related Reading: Ethereum Retests Breakout Zone, Analyst Sets $3,500 Target Considering that the transactions have spiked after the price has registered a significant drawdown from its recent local top above $0.94, though, it’s possible that the whales are making these moves to buy at the current relatively low prices. It now remains to be seen how the Polygon price develops in the coming days given the high amount of trading activity that the whales have been participating in. MATIC Price Following the recent plunge, Polygon hasn’t been moving much in the last few days as its price has gone rather stale below the $0.80 level.

In a biweekly call Thursday, the developers discussed that they are targeting Jan. 17 for the Goerli test network (testnet) to run through Dencun, the much-anticipated upgrade that will enable “proto-danksharding,” which reduces fees for layer 2 rollups and scale the blockchain by increasing space for “blobs” of data.  “Obviously if we find a major issue or something crazy before then we can always cancel,” Tim Beiko, protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, said on the call. “This would mean ideally we’re putting out the blog post for the fork sometime during the week of Jan. 8, so people have at least a week to update.”  Dencun was originally targeted for the last quarter of 2023, but the developers pushed it back to 2024, citing the engineering complexities of the upgrade.  Developers also discussed a draft timeline for the Dencun testing upgrade, aiming to run through another test network, Sepolia, on Jan. 31, the Holesky testnet on Feb. 7, and then proceeding to deploy the changes on mainnet around the end of February. These dates could change depending on the outcome of the testnet forks, they cautioned.

42418990,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDB0v,1703170264,Prometheum Earns Final Regulatory Nod to Try Hand at Fully-Compliant Crypto,"Prometheum Inc., with the latest regulatory notch on its belt, is about to finally test whether a viable crypto platform can operate entirely within U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, according to a FINRA document outlining the expanded licensing. The letter, signed Wednesday by co-CEO Benjamin Kaplan, has to be resubmitted to FINRA to finalize the new status..  Prometheum was already the first and only special-purpose crypto broker dealer licensed under SEC rules. It's now obtained approval to clear and settle digital assets securities trades. While the company hasn't yet made its first trade or earned its first dollar of revenue, co-CEO Aaron Kaplan said it will begin taking custody of institutional clients' assets within the next quarter.  ""There's a significant amount of institutional pent-up demand that's been looking to participate in the space,"" Kaplan said in an interview, saying that's been illustrated by all the interest in the potential approval of a bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund by the SEC.  Kaplan said the regulatory questions plaguing U.S. crypto have kept some institutions on the sidelines, and an approved firm that speaks the same compliance language as them ""will allow those institutions to feel comfortable and allow for that pent up demand to be met.""  A FINRA spokesperson said the self-regulatory organization had no comment.  Path to compliance  The company's latest approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a securities industry standards and licensing organization that reports to the SEC, will likely rekindle the tense debate over Prometheum's status. Kaplan has been an aggressive advocate of his company's approach to compliance, even as most of the crypto industry has devoted years of policy energy in explaining how it's impossible to run a digital-assets platform under existing rules.  Companies have actually made that case in court, with U.S. exchange Coinbase arguing in April that ""existing SEC registration and disclosure requirements are incompatible with digital assets.""  The problem for the crypto sector: If Prometheum succeeds, it undermines everybody else's core complaint about operating in the U.S. Other companies have been waging expensive and time-consuming court battles with the SEC over how the agency defines crypto securities and demands registration from exchanges.  Prometheum intends to begin its digital asset custody services for asset managers, hedge funds and other financial institutions in the first quarter of 2024. By the second quarter, the company plans to make trading and clearing available to clients – first for institutional customers, then retail investors. Kaplan also sees it as a potential platform for the tokenization of traditional securities, he said.  As Prometheum rose to prominence this year for its sector-contrary view on compliance, Kaplan waged a rhetorical war with crypto competitors, which got the CEO tapped to testify in Congress. Some in the industry have predicted Prometheum's business model will never happen, despite the unusual and unprecedented regulatory licensing.  Token listings  The SEC hasn't made the process of trading digital assets especially clear, with Chair Gary Gensler insisting that the same securities laws that have always applied to investment contracts should apply in the same way to virtually all cryptocurrencies. So far, judges haven't entirely agreed with that view.  Still, the commission will only openly acknowledge a single crypto name as being outside its securities jurisdiction: bitcoin. The agency routinely names other tokens as securities in enforcement cases, but that leaves the remaining thousands of tokens in a regulatory limbo. However, both Gensler and his predecessor, Jay Clayton, have publicly stated their view that most cryptocurrencies are securities.  Other, unregistered crypto platforms have made their own decisions about which tokens won't trigger the SEC's securities alarm, and their choices have often run afoul of enforcement actions from the regulator.  Prometheum has previously acknowledged that, when it got its approval as one of about 70 SEC-regulated alternative trading systems (ATSs), it disclosed examples of the securities it would support – a couple of which have also been marked as such by the agency. It told the regulator it could offer Flow (FLOW), Protocol Labs’ Filecoin (FIL), The Graph (GRT), Compound (COMP) and the Celo platform’s CELO, for instance.  ""The public discussion that basically almost every digital asset besides bitcoin is likely a security gives us a significant amount of potential assets which we can support for custody and trading,"" Kaplan said. When asked what specific tokens the company expects to take on, he said he's ""not answering specifics about assets.""  Kaplan said Prometheum will make further announcements next year. He also declined to say whether the SEC had given the company any specific guidance as the company approached this latest approval.  ""There's been standard communication with our regulators,"" Kaplan said.  Unregistered securities?  Industry executives and lobbyists contend that Prometheum would only be able to trade securities registered with the SEC. And since the bulk of crypto assets remain on the outside, they said the company will have nothing to trade. But Prometheum argues that the SEC's requirements, such as routine disclosures, are primarily the responsibility of whoever is backing an asset and not the job of a trading platform like this one.  ""While we support the SEC’s registration and accompanying disclosure requirements for issuers under federal securities laws, it is the SEC, not Prometheum, that is responsible for enforcement,"" Kaplan said.  An ATS, Kaplan said, has more leeway than a more acutely regulated national exchange. He said a registered exchange has to work with issuers to list their assets, but an ATS has a ""different consideration.""  ""An alternative trading system chooses to support an asset based on its customers' needs,"" he said.  About 50 employees work at Prometheum and its affiliates, Kaplan said, and public records show eight registered brokers ready to handle trading there. Now that the company is licensed for custody, trading, clearing and settling, Kaplan said, it can ""service the lifecycle of a digital asset"" all in one shop.  With the doors set to open soon, the coming months will be the true test for the company. Until Prometheum operates as a custodian and trading platform for a while without the SEC rolling in to tell the company to cut it out, the business will remain surrounded by doubts from its detractors.  The SEC could also further boost the relevance of Prometheum if it finalizes its recent proposal to demand registered investment advisers only park their clients' crypto assets with ""qualified custodians"" – a term that Gensler argued doesn't include today's crypto exchanges. The rule is targeted for an April list on the SEC's latest rulemaking agenda. As a crypto-native firm licensed to take custody of digital assets, Prometheum could be on a very short list.  SEC Chair Gensler also gave Prometheum another shout-out – though not by name – on Friday when he rejected Coinbase's petition for the agency to write wide-ranging regulations tailored to the industry.

This evolution was particularly spearheaded by Bitcoin’s dominance, with the crypto registering gains in the last quarter that were practically absent in the earlier parts of the year. All the signs are there; interest is picking up, big money from institutions is sniffing around again, several important technical and on-chain pricing models this year have been confirmed, and the dust seems to have finally settled from the prolonged bear market in 2022. Total market cap at $1.59 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com The Crypto Winter Thaws: Signs of Life in 2023 2023 was majorly a year of correction for the extended bear market in 2022 which saw Bitcoin fall 76% from its all-time high to trade at a bottom of $15,883. According to a report from Glassnode, major market structure shifts are now taking place within the crypto industry to reflect growing optimism. Related Reading: Institutional Investors Increase Bitcoin Appetite Ahead Of Spot ETF, Report Shows Bitcoin, for one, is showing a strong interest from its long-term holders, as the industry awaits the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. One particular feature of the year that indicated a strong bullish momentum was the shallow depth of market correction, indicating the industry is maturing into a more stable market in terms of price volatility. Bitcoin’s deepest correction in 2023 closed just -20% below the local high, better than historical pullbacks of least -25% to -50%. Source: Glassnode Ethereum also saw shallow corrections, with the deepest reaching -40% in early January. Source: Glassnode From an on-chain perspective, the realized cap in the 2022 bear market for both assets showed a net capital outflow of -18% for BTC and -30% for ETH. The momentum kickstarted in October, as the news of various applications of spot Bitcoin ETFs turned the crypto market on its heels. As a result, Bitcoin finally broke above the $30,000 level which it had traded below for the majority of the year. This cascaded into the altcoin market, with Solana, Cardano, and Ethereum all seeing renewed interest and growth in prices and DeFi TVL. According to Glassnode, the total value locked into Ethereum’s layer-2 blockchains increased by 60%, with over $12 billion now locked into bridges. Related Reading: Finance Expert Says Explains Why XRP Is A Scam According to CoinShares, the bullish sentiment has also flowed into institutions. October’s rally sparked an 11-week run of inflows into digital asset investment funds. At the time of writing, the year-to-date inflows now sit at $1.86 billion. The crypto industry, particularly Bitcoin, is primed for astounding growth in 2024, with various price catalysts like the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the US, and the next Bitcoin halving. The altcoin market should also follow, spearheaded by Ethereum. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is up by 159% this year, outperforming other asset classes. On the other hand, Ethereum and Solana have dominated the altcoin market, up by 82% and 616% respectively.

42419028,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDAyr,1703168790,Animoca-Backed Game Wallet Wars Delegates Release Decision to DAO Vote,"Who makes the decision to release a new game? The Marketing department? Quality control? Some management committee?  How about everyone?  The decision to launch Wallet Wars, a Web3 iteration of the 1970s arcade game Space Invaders, was taken by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) after the Balthazar DAO voted 1,800-12 to approve the move. It went live Dec. 15 after more than a year of development. The vote took place on Snapshot, a DAO voting portal.  The release of the game, created by Australian John Stefanidis, isn't the only aspect that's being delegated. A decision on whether and when to launch a crypto token, BZR, will also be subject to a DAO vote early next year.  “We’re trying to decentralize the whole thing gradually,” Stefanidis said in an interview. “A degree of that has been achieved with the vote to launch the game and next will be a vote on the token launch. In a year or two no one's going to care who the co-founders were. It's going to be completely decentralized and eventually we'll get voted out and someone hungrier will come in and run it.”  DAOs are a model of collaborative governance under which token holders vote on different ideas. The use of DAO voting in business decisions is far from ubiquitous. Previously, the Aavegotchi community voted for an upgrade. While some supporters argue the collaborative decision-making process can be beneficial, it's not obviously always so. In one case, the Aragon DAO was closed because of different agendas between token holders, team members, and blockchain operators.  The Wallet Wars project has raised $6 million since its inception in September 2021. Animoca Brands and Kucoin Labs are among the backers, with the former’s $1.5 million funding valuing the project at US$60 million.  Interest in the game has grown rapidly this year, particularly since August, when the @WalletWarsGame handle went live on X, formerly Twitter. It now has 71,400 followers. The @BalthazarDAO handle has 57,000 followers and Balthazar's community on Discord has 45,600 members.  “The community has been giving us heaps of feedback and we're going to push a whole bunch of changes live based on their feedback through a DAO vote,” said Stefanidis, a tech entrepreneur. Fred Schebesta, famous for founding the financial comparison website Finder.com, provided advice.  How it works  The game is built on the Ethereum scaling platform zkSync, a layer-2 network that uses zero-knowledge rollups to speed up transaction times while lowering the cost. To play, users must buy non-fungible tokens (NFTs) known as raw ships with ether. Each one costs 0.01 ETH. A proportion of the purchase cost, about 60% to 70%, goes into a prize pool.  Another NFT, the raw pass, unlocks other aspects of the product, including governance rights and access to rewards.  The ""raw"" moniker and Wallet Wars' rallying cry, ""Raw eht nioJ,"" is a nod to The Simpsons TV show, where the wording previously appeared. The phrase is ""Join the war"" spelt backwards.  Wallet Wars offers a number of games and different ways of winning. Players can play for free using demo ship NFTs. But for a chance to win rewards, they must buy in. The raw pass, 5,555 of which were issued in October, provides premium access to the Wallet Wars ecosystem.  ""These multiple layers of rewards make this the game of games which serves the objective of a financialized arcade game or a game that has good sustainable reward systems,"" Stefanidis said.  Balthazar’s operations are managed by JBPH Technologies, a Singapore-registered company.

42419004,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDBAD,1703163660,First Mover Americas: This Year's Top Performers and What Comes Next,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Layer-1 blockchain Solana (SOL) led the way in 2023 in terms of token price gains, with other altcoins Avalanche (AVAX), Stacks (STX) and Helium’s (HNT) following closely behind. Solana, which began its sharp increase in mid-October, has risen over 700% since the start of the year. HNT also made considerable gains, climbing 500%. Most of the advance came this month, following the company’s move into the mobile space. For Avalanche, there have been a number of institutional partnerships that helped lift the token some 300% year-to-date. Looking forward, analysts pointed to tokenization of real-world assets as a booming segment to watch. Chris Newhouse, a former derivatives trader and the founder of Infiniti Labs, said the “Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) narrative” will continue to be a hot topic, with tokens such as RNDR and HNT recently outperforming the market. DePINs use cryptocurrency tokens to incentivize building of real-world infrastructure.  More than $1 billion in assets belonging to the founders of the bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) have been frozen by a British Virgin Islands court, according to the firm's liquidators, Teneo Restructuring. The worldwide court order, issued Monday, applies to founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies as well as Davies' wife, Kelly Chen, Teneo said in an email. 3AC filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in July last year after the collapse of stablecoin issuer Terra caused irrecoverable losses. Teneo has been seeking $1.3 billion and included Chen in the order to use all available avenues to maximize returns to creditors, whose claims total more than $3 billion. Zhu, jailed for four months in Singapore in September for failing to help wind up 3AC, is expected to be released this month for good behavior.  Bitcoin (BTC) neared the $44,000 level early Thursday and reversed some losses, which were caused by the sudden drop in U.S. stocks on Wednesday. The S&P 500 index fell 1.42% Wednesday, hurting riskier assets such as bitcoin. Some analysts pointed out that a correction was overdue as market indications were in overbought territory and the expiry of a certain type of options created selling pressure. Bitcoin and trending tokens such as Solana’s SOL and Avalanche’s AVAX took a hit after the broader market plunge but climbed in early Asian hours on Thursday. SOL extended gains to 15% in the past 24 hours, and the advance from a multiweek rally to over 55%.  Chart of the Day  Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust Fund (GBTC) discount to net asset value (NAV) is holding near the narrowest since August 2021.  The discount widened slightly to 7.90% on Wednesday  The discount has been shrinking as a result of optimism that a bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) will be approved in the U.S.  GBTC is the world’s largest bitcoin investment vehicle and has traded at a discount since February 2021 and hit record lows of nearly 50% in December last year.

21641231,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566307,1703163641,"XRP Whales Show Exchange Inflow Activity, Bad Sign For Price?","On-chain data shows that XRP whales have been making exchange inflows in the past day, a sign that may be negative for the asset’s price. XRP Whales Have Made Multiple Large Exchange Inflows Today According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, the XRP network has handled a few large transactions during the last 24 hours. In total, there have been four such transfers, each worth at least $10.9 million. Given the huge scale of these moves, it’s likely that whale entities were responsible for them. Related Reading: Ethereum Retests Breakout Zone, Analyst Sets $3,500 Target The whales are naturally influential players on the network as they carry large amounts in their wallets. Thus, their transfers can be worth watching, as they may end up causing fluctuations in the market. How such a transfer would influence the price depends on what the intent behind it was. It’s generally hard to find the exact motive behind any transaction, but depending on what type of transfer it was and which wallets were involved, some hints can perhaps be gathered. Three of the whale transactions from the past day have been similar in structure. Here are the address details of the first of these large transfers: Looks like this massive move only took a negligible fee of 0.000015 XRP to be possible | Source: Whale Alert As is visible above, this transaction involved a movement of 24.6 million XRP (worth over $15 million at the time the transfer went through) between an unknown wallet and an address attached to the cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp. Unknown wallets are addresses unaffiliated with any known central entity, so the sender address here was likely the whale’s personal wallet. One of the main reasons why an investor would transfer coins from their self-custodial wallets to an exchange is for selling purposes, so it’s possible that this humongous holder has made this move to part with the stack. Interestingly, the second exchange inflow transaction from the last 24 hours also appears to have been made by the same whale, as the sending addresses match. The second exchange inflow from the past day | Source: Whale Alert While the receiver in the case of this transaction worth 18 million XRP ($10.9 million) is also an exchange, the platform is Bitso this time, and not Bitstamp as was the case with the other transfer. The third and final exchange inflow seems to have involved both a different sender and receiver, suggesting that a different whale entirely was responsible for this 20 million tokens ($12.1 million) transfer. The latest of the XRP whale transactions | Source: Whale Alert As mentioned earlier, it’s hard to say for sure anything about the intent behind these moves, but given that they are exchange inflows, they can potentially end up proving to be bearish for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Are On The Move: A Worrying Sign? The fourth and the oldest large transaction that has occurred inside this window was actually the largest one and it would appear that Ripple, the company behind the cryptocurrency, was the sender involved. Ripple seems to have made a large outflow | Source: Whale Alert As is apparent above, the firm has shifted 120 million XRP ($73.8 million) to an unknown wallet. There can be many reasons why the company would have made such a transaction, ranging from a simple change of wallets to a selling move. Token Price XRP has mostly been moving sideways recently as it currently trades around the $0.61886 level.

42418998,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDB77,1703155283,"Solana, Avax, Helium Led Digital Assets Gains This Year. What's Next?","Layer-1 blockchain Solana [SOL] led the way in 2023 in terms of token price gains, with other altcoins Avalanche [AVAX], Stacks [STX] and Helium’s [HNT] following closely behind. The digital asset gains came as the largest cryptocurrency by market value, bitcoin [BTC], also witnessed a strong year amid growing optimism that spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will be approved early in the new year.  Solana, which began its sharp increase in mid-October, has gained over 700% since the start of the year. The rally was unaffected by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission naming the token among other cryptos as “unregistered securities,” in a complaint against cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase in June.  Solana also fared well despite its relationship with collapsed exchange FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried, whose trial ended in November. Bankman-Fried was a prominent backer of Solana and acquired over $1 billion worth of the tokens through his companies Alameda Research and FTX.  Most of SOL’s gains came following the conclusion of the trial. The network has since seen increased growth in monthly active addresses and the launch of several memecoins including BONK, which was listed recently on crypto exchange Coinbase.  “There were real questions around Solana’s survival after the collapse of FTX, but it has instead thrived with increasing activity on the chain, a newfound appreciation for its innovative technology, and several high profile airdrops,” said Brian Rudick, a senior strategist at GSR.  HNT  Helium’s HNT also made considerable gains in 2023, most of them in December, following the company’s move into the mobile space. HNT gained 500% over the year. Helium migrated to Solana in April from its own blockchain. Helium is a blockchain-based network for Internet of Things devices that uses nodes as hotspots to connect wireless devices to the network.  According to Christopher Martin, director of research at Amberdata, 2023 was a huge year for Helium because of its jump into the mobile sector. “The network seems to have major plans in mobile and IoT, and allowing mobile plan users to earn tokens (MOBILE) by supporting the network and pay the monthly bill with them, creates a flywheel effect for the network,” said Martin.  He also noted that “the recent BONK craze has led the Solana Saga phone to sell out (since the phones come with a BONK claim), which also has a free 30-day subscription to Helium Mobile,” said Martin. “In short, there's a lot of anticipation for MOBILE and HNT to grow with the mobile network due to the symbiotic relationship between the network benefits of user growth.”  AVAX  For Avalanche, there have been a number of institutional partnerships that helped lift the token. AVAX has gained 300% year-to-date. Avalanche announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services in January and was part of J.P. Morgan and Apollo Global's blockchain platform, Onyx’s proof-of-concept project in November.  Chris Newhouse, a former derivatives trader and the founder of Infiniti Labs, a DeFi advisory and consulting firm, said Avalanche’s rally this year has mostly been down to trading on news. “Although this time, I’d argue this isn’t ALL due to the alt L1 narrative that was previously traded in the last cycle (SoLunAvax) where people were just rotating in and out of different L1s and altcoins,”  “Avalanche has made massive strides with institutional partnerships, associating themselves with Apollo and JP Morgan, as well as a previous AWS partnership made at the beginning of the year, and is shaping itself to be one of the best chains conducive to institutional activity,” said Newhouse in an interview with CoinDesk.  Bitcoin also had a strong year in terms of price action, mainly due to enthusiasm surrounding a potential spot bitcoin ETF. The cryptocurrency has gained 164% year-to-date. Rudick said in an interview that the ETF hype was the main catalyst, but a supportive macroeconomic environment helped as well.  STX  Stacks (STX), the native token of Stacks Network, gained 623% over the year. The token rallied in March amid booming hype for Bitcoin Ordinals, a way to inscribe data to the Bitcoin blockchain, and growing total value locked (TVL) on the protocol.  Stacks is known for being the first token distributed through the first-ever U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) qualified token offering in 2019. Stacks is a Bitcoin layer-2 protocol for smart contracts that’s attempting to transform and extend Bitcoin’s functionality from its widely known role as an alternative payment system to a more versatile, programmable platform.  Stacks Network’s TVL has surged over the year too, climbing to $50 million from $6 million in January, according to data from DeFiLlama.  More recently, Stacks jumped by 27% on Wednesday following a series of positive comments from veteran investor Tim Draper.  2024 Predictions  Rudick said he expects to see bitcoin and ether [ETH] continue to rally in the new year, helped in part by inflows of likely approvals of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. He also noted that in 2024, “we see decentralized identity ushering in a new wave of blockchain users given plans or announced interest from China, the EU, Brazil, and others.”  Martin said that aside from the ETF focus early in the new year, real-world assets will be the booming segment to watch. “We’ve seen the foundations being set up this year but we haven't seen the mainstream catch up just yet.”  Newhouse said, looking forward, the “Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) narrative” will continue to be a hot topic, with tokens such as RNDR and HNT recently outperforming the market. DePINs use cryptocurrency tokens to incentivize building of real-world infrastructure.  “Traditional fund managers have also expressed interest specific in HNT, with Bill Ackman supporting the token in 2022,” Newhouse added.",POSITIVE,BTC | SOL | HNT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | SOL | HNT,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/21/solana-avax-helium-led-digital-assets-gains-this-year-whats-next,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/06bf4f5e9df2d6fdf520f38cc2dced25e0e62bc3-3428x1928.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

21639161,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566302,1703152815,"Crypto Analyst Says Ignore FUD, XRP Is Headed To $5.85","Crypto analyst Dark Defender has also weighed in on the recent narratives revolving around the XRP tepid price action. The analyst is choosing not to listen to any of those as he is confident that the future trajectory of the XRP token is bullish. No Need To Listen To FUD In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Dark Defender mentioned that he doesn’t listen to the FUD (Fear, uncertainty, and doubt). He also seemed to be urging the XRP community to ignore the FUD as he stated that the token is still proceeding according to “our plan” based on the weekly time frame. Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Balances Drop Drastically, What This Means For ETH Price Source: X He alluded back to several comments and analyses he had made about XRP’s price action. One of them was on June 4, when he had set Wave 1 on the charts to $0.89. On June 21, he also detailed the target levels that XRP could attain. Meanwhile, he had set the limit for Wave 2 to $0.46 and Wave 3 to $1.88 on September 13. Dark Defender noted that nothing has changed since then, as the targets “were and are the same.” The crypto analyst was basically suggesting that there was no need to be worried about XRP’s price action as everything was going according to plan from a technical analysis perspective. XRP Still Headed To $5.85 As to XRP’s future trajectory, Dark Defender reaffirmed that the upcoming target is still $1.88 and $5.85 based on the Elliot Waves, which he had highlighted months back. From the accompanying chart that he shared, Dark Defender focused more on the $5.85 price level. Source: X He is confident in XRP hitting that price because he foresees the token touching the “261.80% Fibonacci Level at $5.85.” It won’t, however, be up from $1.88 as the crypto analyst predicts that there will be a correction from that price level. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price In Trouble: Whale Transfers 85 Million DOGE To Robinhood Going by Dark Defender’s past price predictions, $5.85 won’t be the peak, as one can still expect upward price movement. The crypto analyst had previously mentioned that XRP would hit $18 soon enough. He noted then that XRP was likely going to face a strong resistance at $1.08. However, he projects that it will be “kaboom” once XRP is able to break from that level. In the meantime, many will be hoping that XRP can at least experience a significant rally to end the year. At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $0.61, up over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The S&P 500 index closed 1.42% lower, impacting riskier assets such as bitcoin. Some analysts pointed out that a correction was overdue as market indications were in overbought territory and the expiry of a certain type of options created selling pressure.  Bitcoin and trending tokens such as Solana’s SOL and Avalanche’s AVAX took a hit after the broader market plunge but climbed in early Asian hours on Thursday. SOL extended gains to 15% in the past 24 hours, and extended gains from a multi-week rally to over 55%.  Traders’ optimism around bitcoin remained strong ahead of an expected spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the U.S., which could bolster demand, and the halving event scheduled for April 2024, which has historically preceded bull runs for the crypto market.  However, some traders pointed out current bitcoin market metrics flashed signs of cooling down after a month-long rally – suggesting a low period of volatility ahead of the holidays.  “This week has witnessed a sideways trend, with bitcoin moving between $40,500 and $43,500 and ether between $2,150 and $2,250,” said Rachel Lin, CEO and co-founder of SynFutures. “Both these coins and the broader market are consolidating near their recent highs following a rapid increase in value during November.”  “One notable effect of this sideways movement is the cooling down of RSI, which, two weeks ago, was in highly overbought territory. Bitcoin’s weekly RSI stands at around 75, down from 82 at the beginning of the month,” Lin added.

The Injective ecosystem’s biggest investors started to increase their holdings after INJ passed its previous all-time high of $22, according to on-chain data. In 2023, INJ started a parabolic climb. The token hit a new all-time high at the end of this sharp rise before somewhat declining.

As of this writing, INJ weakened a bit, and was trading at $38.60, still up roughly 28% in just the previous seven days despite the retreat. Although some analysts had earlier forecast that INJ prices will probably soar over $40 before the year is up, that is still up in the air given a number of macroeconomic considerations. INJ market cap currently at $3.3 billion. Chart: TradingView.com On Wednesday, injective saw yet another surge as investors kept pouring money into the altcoin and cryptocurrency markets. Situated squarely at the crossroads of decentralized finance and AI, its governance token has emerged as one of the most successful digital assets of 2023. Market watchers have identified a number of major factors driving this incredible rally, including the acceleration from leverage-seeking short-term traders, centralized exchanges’ incentives for creating volatility, and a spike in trading volumes for INJ perpetual futures contracts that exceeded $25 billion in a single day. More Whales Are Gobbling Up INJ Between December 4 and December 19, whale trades for $100,000 and more increased, contributing to the boom. The Network Realized Profit/Loss measure shows that this is in line with taking profits. The Santiment chart above shows that INJ holders made money on their token sales in December. Related Reading: Solana Q4 Triumph: Soaring Activity Leaves Ethereum In The Dust – Report Meanwhile, INJ has shown a fantastic price rise that has exceeded a remarkable 500% growth in value since middle of October.

This could result in short-term volatility for bitcoin, which will shift the focus towards ether [ETH].  “It is likely that the actual demand for the bitcoin spot ETF at the start will fall short of market expectations,” QCP wrote. “We expect topside resistance for bitcoin in the $45k-$48.5k region and a possible retracement to 36k levels before the uptrend resumes.”  Bitcoin is currently trading above $43,700 during Asia business hours, up 2% on-day.  QCP writes that ether is seen as a potential secondary investment option with an anticipated market shift from bitcoin, and speculative interest in a forthcoming ether spot ETF could drive ether prices higher, even before the ETF’s actual launch.  “Ether might also be an interesting laggard play here,” they wrote. “This kind of headline excitement could create some speculative uplift for ETH price whether it is warranted or not.”  CoinDesk reported that BlackRock (BLK), Nasdaq (NDAQ), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) held their second meeting in a month to discuss rule changes for listing the bitcoin ETF, with BlackRock modifying its proposal to include cash redemptions, aligning with SEC preferences.

Although the hype has since cooled down, a few outliers continue to follow the upward trend. NEAR is one of those tokens that aren’t showing signs of cooling down. According to Coingecko, the token is up nearly 8% in the daily, with the biggest jump being at 23% in the weekly timeframe. With this price ascent, NEAR just reached a new high of $2.81. The token hit its all-time high of $20.42 in January 2022. The token’s market capitalization has likewise ballooned significantly, currently priced around $2.8 billion. Several on-chain integrations power this new wave of bullishness for NEAR. Related Reading: Solana Q4 Triumph: Soaring Activity Leaves Ethereum In The Dust – Report NEAR: Monolithic And Modular? Recently, eyes are on NEAR as it continues to improve its systems. According to a Medium article last week, the protocol is implementing more changes to become what they call “a monolithic going modular” blockchain. “In a monolithic blockchain, all four functions are executed by the same set of nodes. This has some benefits, such as high security, easier deployment, and potentially improved utility for users thanks to the ability to specialize the entire network,” the Medium article said. Although the NEAR team says that the token is a monolothic chain, its implementation of sharding do not overwhelm individual validators. However, this isn’t enough for users as both users and developers quickly realized that publishing on Ethereum becomes an expensive ordeal. But NEAR DA aims to change that. NEAR market cap currently at $2.839 billion. Chart: TradingView.com NEAR DA (“DA” meaning data availability) will give rollup operators access to NEAR’s storage capacity. “NEAR runs four shards with roughly 16MB throughput a second. Assuming 100 bytes per transaction, you can store quite a significant amount of your data on NEAR at a fraction of the cost of publishing to NEAR,” the article explained. As of writing, only a handful of rollups are using NEAR DA; namely Caldera, Fluent, and Movement Labs. Once this capability is in the hands of commercial users and other rollup operators, NEAR will be able to increase exposure to other investors. Meanwhile, according to Artemis data, there has been a significant increase in network activity on the NEAR blockchain since the beginning of the month. The data source claims that there has been a 975% increase in the daily count of unique wallet addresses sending on-chain transactions on the network. Source: Artemis How Does This Affect NEAR’s Price? As of now, the token is on its way to break through $2.90 price ceiling. However, it seems that the January 2022 high of $20.42 will be a tough nut to crack as the bears mount a strong defense. But the advent of strong on-chain development along with good market conditions will bring more bullishness in the short to medium-term.

The joint venture between Brinc, a global venture accelerator and The Sandbox was announced in Feb. 2023 and led to the creation of BharatBox, a cultural metaverse hub for India that encompasses Bollywood, India’s famous Hindi cinema industry too.  “The Indian entity of The Sandbox is BharatBox,” said Karan Keswani, CEO of BharatBox. “BharatVerse is the Indian land on The Sandbox map.”  Its ambitions for India come at a time when lawmakers have asked the Web3 industry to decouple itself from crypto. India’s crypto industry has been in survival mode after the nation imposed stiff taxes in 2022. For a Web3 gaming giant to foray into India despite the regulatory clouds is reflective of the interest in the nation’s gaming and developer promise.  “We are ready to engage with and help regulators to discuss the space,” Borget said.  In the past six months, BharatBox has signed 25 Indian partners, including Eros Entertainment, Hungama and Shemaroo, three legacy media entertainment companies in Indian cinema. But the one partnership that Keswani expects will catapult India into The Sandbox’s largest market is the one with CoinDCX, a prominent Indian exchange.  “Our strategic ecosystem partnership with CoinDCX and the Web3 wallet Okto gives us exposure to their 16 million users,” said Keswani. “Globally, The Sandbox has five million wallets. Along with CoinDCX and Okto, we’re confident of bringing three to four million gamers through their Okto community, and that’s our vision, to onboard those users within 24 months, and then India will be The Sandbox’s largest market.”  CoinDCX and Okto co-founder Neeraj Khandelwal told CoinDesk that “Okto is glad to be working with one of the best players in the Metaverse and gaming ecosystem to help them get a strong footing in India.""  Most of the partnerships are contract and land partner agreements that will allow the company to use its acquired Land NFTs in the open metaverse to build gamified experiences in The Sandbox dedicated to India, such as a recent one to bring India’s epic Mahabharat to the Metaverse.  BharatBox is also working towards bringing the wider portfolio of Animoca Brands to India to provide other Web3 solutions such as ticketing and blockchain gaming.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/12/21/the-sandbox-aims-to-make-india-its-largest-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5b2bc71d302fdaa68ccf1a03053bcead4381bdf-1024x576.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
