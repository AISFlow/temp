The bitcoin stock-to-flow model currently suggests the price of bitcoin should be around $77,900. But as of Monday, the cryptocurrency was trading at $33,668, well off the all-time high price of $64,829 reached in April.      Crypto analyst ""PlanB,"" who has been documenting his stock-to-flow model since March 2019, tweeted that BTC/USD is now the furthest away from the estimated value in more than two years.      He said the next six months will “make or break'' the stock-to-flow model.      The stock-to-flow model is generally applied to natural resources such as gold or silver. The commodities are often referred to as “store of value” resources that, in theory, should retain their value over the long term due to their scarcity and low flow.      The idea is that low supply makes the metals more like ""hard money"" – contrasted with the dollar. This is an especially harsh juxtaposition as the Federal Reserve has printed more than $4 trillion in fresh dollars since the coronavirus pandemic hit in March 2020; that's the same amount the U.S. central bank had previously created since it was established early in the last century.      Bitcoin, sometimes touted by proponents as “digital gold,” is treated as if it were a scarce commodity for the purposes of the model. Bitcoin is costly to produce and considered scarce, as its maximum supply is capped at 21 million coins.      The cryptocurrency also undergoes “bitcoin halvings” where the number of bitcoins entering the system with every new data block – every 10 minutes or so on average – gets cut in half. These halvings take place roughly every four years.    Read more: Bitcoin Holds Support; Faces Resistance at $36K    “Bitcoin has limited supply, which is great and well known,” said Charles Morris, founder of ByteTree Asset Management. “As supply is cemented, the price can only be driven by demand.”      In the past, the bitcoin stock-to-flow model has been used to forecast future BTC price action. Pantera Capital, a hedge fund that specializes in cryptocurrencies, predicted in April 2020 that bitcoin could rise to $115,000 by August this year, using this model.      PlanB wrote in a blog post in April 2020 that the price of bitcoin could hit $288,000 by 2024, citing the stock-to-flow model.      “According to the model’s projections, bitcoin’s price should see a significant increase over time due to its continually reduced stock-to-flow ratio,” said Binance Academy in a blog post.      It's worth noting the model relies heavily on the assumption that the scarcity of the cryptocurrency should drive value, which might not always be the case. That's especially true because of the notoriously volatile short-term swings in the bitcoin price.

The ""Nightfall 3"" project combines zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), akin to the firm's previous releases in this area, the company said Thursday.  Nightfall 3 aggregates transactions into groups, known as rollups, designed to lighten the transaction load on the blockchain by transferring them to layer 2.  EY's work utilizes what's known as ""optimistic rollups,"" named as such because the system assumes transactions to be valid unless proven otherwise, removing the need for validation from all participants.  “Based on EY experience, ZK-Optimistic rollups are currently among the most effective in balancing security incentives and mathematical efficiency for running private transactions on the public Ethereum network,"" Paul Brody, EY Global Blockchain leader, said. ""As we have in the past, we are again contributing this code into the public domain to speed up enterprise adoption of this technology.”  Nightfall 3 could achieve costs of around one-eighth of those needed for a conventional token transfer on Ethereum, according to EY's announcement.

42406793,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8KoW,1625482446,Bitcoin's Weekend Price Bounce Fades Even as Exchange Balances Drop,"Bitcoin's weekend ascent has run out of steam even though blockchain data and weakness in the U.S. dollar indicate the path of least resistance is to the higher side.      The top cryptocurrency by market value is trading near $34,200 at press time, representing a 3% drop on the day, CoinDesk 20 data shows.      The pullback has reversed a significant chunk of the bounce from $32,700 to $36,000 seen in the past three days. It comes amid a decline in the number of coins held on exchanges, a bullish development.      Balance held on centralized exchanges fell to 2.577 million BTC on Sunday, hitting the lowest level since May 16, according to data tracked by Glassnode.      The tally has dropped by more than 25,000 BTC in two weeks, meaning fewer bitcoins are now available for sale compared with the second half of June. Investors typically take direct custody of their bitcoins when expecting a price rise or aiming to generate an extra yield by tokenizing the cryptocurrency on Ethereum's blockchain.      Furthermore, that's not the only sign wealthy investors are stepping up their bargain hunting. So the odds appear stacked in favor of bulls – especially as the dollar is trading weakly in the currency markets despite Friday's upbeat U.S. employment data.      Bitcoin has mostly moved in the opposite direction to the dollar index (DXY) since the Federal Reserve surprised markets with its early interest-rate hike forecast on June 16. Rate increases make fiat currencies attractive and dilute the appeal of inflation hedges like bitcoin and gold.      The DXY, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, is currently at 92.14, down 0.6% from Friday's four-month high of 92.74, according to TradingView data.      Also read: Investors Cashing Out of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Might Bring Market Boost      The greenback may suffer a more profound drop if the minutes of the Fed's June meeting, scheduled for release later this week, downplay rate-hike prospects.

2804457,https://eng.ambcrypto.com/?p=77188,1625465102,"Binance Coin, Polkadot, MATIC Price Analysis: 21 May","Binance Coin needed to retake the key 50% Fibonacci level ($445.5) to assert bullish control. Polkadot could stabilize at the $27.8-support level before moving north, but bearish cues could result in a drop back towards $25. Finally, MATIC could dip to $1.50 before bouncing back above $2. Binance Coin [BNB] Source: BNB/USD on TradingView Binance Coin's recovery was in progress after it reclaimed the 78.6% Fibonacci level ($353.7), but a critical area lay at the 50% Fibonacci level ($445.5). This key area has countered multiple pullback attempts since, forming a reliable defensive zone in the process. If BNB manages to reclaim this buy zone, expect it to sustain itself above $445.5 in case of short-term pullbacks. Before such an outcome, the bulls first have to target a hike above the $40.7.6-resistance and the 20-SMA (red). A bullish crossover in the MACD was a step in the right direction and a hike above half-line would be followed by strong bullish sentiment. On the other hand, the RSI was yet to recover from the bearish territory. Polkadot [DOT] Source: DOT/USD , TradingView Like most large-cap alts, Polkadot's movement was also tied strongly to broader market cues. After falling to a low of $19, rapid buying saw DOT make a comeback towards $30 as bull sellers reemerged once again after Bitcoin lost ground on $41k. At press time, DOT hovered just above its $27.8-support and stabilizing at the press time price point could lead to a push above $32.8 and the 20-SMA (red). The Stochastic RSI traded in neutral 50 while the Squeeze Momentum Indicator noted weakening bearish momentum. Regaining the range between $32.9-$38.5 would be an important bullish development - One that would flip bearish conditions in the market. Conversely, a weaker broader market could push DOT back towards $25. MATIC Source: MATIC/USD , TradingView MATIC was one of the few alts in the market that traded above its 200-SMA (green), despite the broader market dump. In fact, it was one of the first few alts to initiate a recovery even before Bitcoin crossed $41k. While MATIC did rise above $2 from its $1.6-support during a rapid buy period yesterday, the 20-SMA (red) formed a stubborn resistance and selling pressure returned. At the time of writing, MATIC threatened to move below its 50-SMA (yellow) on the 4-hour chart. Bearish sentiment could even drag the cryptocurrency towards $1.5. On the plus side, traders could mop up MATIC at this discounted price level and look to go long. The MACD line was in danger of falling below half-mark. With HODLers accumulating MATIC even through the price drop, a strong case can be made for a hike above $2 post the dip. The Stochastic RSI was oversold at the said level and a price reversal can be expected over the coming hours.

42406794,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8KmY,1625459412,"Japan's CBDC to Get a Clearer Picture by 2022, Says Government Official: Report","A political figure who heads a panel on digital currencies for Japan's ruling party has said his country will have a better idea of what to expect from a digital yen by the end of 2022.      Reuters reported Monday that Hideki Murai of the Liberal Democratic Party said Japan would soon have a ""clearer view"" of what a central bank digital currency (CBDC) would look like.      The official also said more details on the CBDC's design may kick up a debate on how its issuance could impact financial institutions. The concerns run contrary to the Bank of Japan's conclusion that a digital yen would not adversely affect private businesses provided they were designed appropriately.      Murai said commercial banks would stand to benefit from a shift back to the bank's control over customer data and business, Reuters reported.      “If the BOJ were to issue CBDC, it would have a huge impact on financial institutions and Japan’s settlement system,” said Murai as cited in the report. “CBDC has the potential to completely reshape changes occurring in Japan’s financial industry.”      In March, the Bank of Japan launched a liaison and coordination committee ahead of its plans to conduct an “initial experiment” or proof-of-concept phase in April. While the central bank stressed it was not yet ready to implement a CBDC, the latest comments from a public official demonstrate a willingness to pursue the issue further.      China, which currently leads the world in CBDC experimentation and implementation, has been trudging along with its efforts to digitize its national currency. China expects to have some parts of its CBDC in circulation by the time the Winter Olympics in Beijing rolls around in February next year.      The Bank of Japan, however, does not view this as a threat to the U.S. dollar and its status as a global reserve currency, according to previous reports – though the bank's plans to push ahead with a CBDC indicates it is, at least, keeping China's plans firmly on its radar.

A district court has afforded an interim name suppression to the ex-employee who admitted to two charges including theft by a person in a special relationship and theft over $1,000, local news outlet Stuff reported Monday.      During his time at the exchange, the unnamed employee created copies of Cryptopia's private keys, saving them to a USB storage drive before taking it home and uploading the data to his personal computer.      At its height, the New Zealand-based exchange, now in liquidation following a disastrous hack in 2019, employed more than 80 staff while servicing 1.4 million customers globally.      Following the hack, all customer accounts, totaling more than $100 million in today's prices, were frozen after more than $17 million in ether and other crypto were stolen. Liquidation proceedings were then established in an attempt to recover affected former users of the exchange.      The man, whose charges are unrelated to the 2019 hack, then told Cryptopia's liquidators, Grant Thornton, in September that he had deposited bitcoin into an old Cryptopia wallet and requested they be returned, Stuff reported. The man also admitted to having returned a portion of the stolen funds, offering to pay the remainder over time.      Grant Thornton, upon reviewing a number of transactions, found that 13 bitcoin had been siphoned off from a number of wallets. The liquidator also discovered two of those bitcoin had been put through a crypto mixer in attempt to conceal their provenance.      The total amount of bitcoin was worth about $235,000 (US$164,950) at the time of the transactions. It was later revealed a further $10,000 (US$ 7,019) in various other crypto had also been taken.

Other notable investors include Binance Labs, Longhash Ventures, IMO Ventures and key opinion leaders who wish to remain anonymous, according to a press release on Monday.      Money raised will go toward furthering the project's expansion and aspirations of becoming a multi-chain system while completing the development of its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).      Tranchess, which has been under development for almost a year, launched June 24 on Binance's Smart Chain — an ecosystem designed for budding DeFi apps running smart contracts.      In essence, the protocol seeks to provide a risk/return matrix from a single main fund, known as Queen, that tracks a specific underlying crypto asset.      The protocol has begun by tracing bitcoin's movements, with a goal of adding more assets in the future. The fund will attempt to serve a variety of clients with different tolerances for risk, as a user may split his or her fund into two sub-funds, Rook and Bishop, the press release stated.      Bishop is a ""yielding"" tranche that has no exposure to bitcoin's price, while the Rook fund is a ""leveraged"" tranche that has twice the exposure to price movements in the underlying crypto.      Once a user splits up his Queen fund into these sub-funds, that user can then sell one fund instantaneously, leaving him with either fixed income or leveraged exposure to bitcoin, a spokesperson for the project told CoinDesk via Telegram.      ""The main fund, Queen, currently tracks bitcoin and can be split into 0.5 Bishop tokens and 0.5 Rook tokens,"" the spokesperson said.""Bishop tokens purely earn more yield and does not track bitcoin at all, while Rook tokens earn smaller yield but are essentially a 2x leverage token for bitcoin.""      Its chess-inspired theme borrows from some concepts of the game, including implementing game theory of the Bishop interest voting system, which allows users to vote on how much interest the fund will generate. Meanwhile, the governance token – used to cast votes and make decisions regarding the protocol – is named Chess.
