42381824,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pqrb,1556987409,NYAG: Bitfinex Should Be Made to Disclose Tether Deal Documents,"New York prosecutors have struck back at cryptocurrency exchange provider Bitfinex, telling a local court that they believe the company should be made to turn over documents outlining a nearly $900 million line of credit offered by stablecoin issuer Tether.  The New York Attorney General’s (NYAG) office first sued Bitfinex and Tether for all documents pertaining to an alleged loss of $850 million by the exchange on April 25, at the time making public that a $625 million loan and another $900 million line of credit had been provided by Tether to help Bitfinex maintain operations in lieu of its lack of immediate funding.  The filing is the latest move in an ongoing legal battle between the NYAG and iFinex, the parent company that owns both Bitfinex and Tether, that began earlier this April.  At the time, the NYAG accused Bitfinex of not being open with Tether's customers about its move to secure nearly $1 billion from the company's funds as part of a loan. iFinex has claimed the terms were created at ""arm's length"" in a deal involving independent representation for both parties.  [embed width=""560"" height=""315""]https://www.youtube.com/embed/UjQjq1eWqCc[/embed]  The NYAG, in its original injunction, said they did not want to prevent Bitfinex or Tether from continuing operations, but did move to prevent Tether from lending any further funds to Bitfinex, a move Bitfinex opposed.  In Saturday’s filing, NYAG officials note that “the order does nothing to limit Respondents’ ability to operate their business in the normal course, as they have continued to do since the injunction.”  They further state that Bitfinex and Tether’s lawyers “admit” that the “narrow” injunction is legal according to state law, and their motion to vacate the order calls on the court to “simply make new law.”  Elsewhere, the filing detailed how the situation was prompted by issues at Crypto Capital, a third-party banking and payments services provider with whom Bitfinex had been holding the $850 million in question. Bitfinex maintains the funds have since been confiscated by law enforcement officials as part of ongoing actions against the company.  Notably, the NYAG used alleged inconsistencies in Bitfinex's testimony about its relationship with Crypto Capital as part of the reason more clarity is needed on the details of the loan.  The document reads:  ""We've given you much latitude to resolve these situations and months beyond your original estimates, we need to have more transparency now. While that and other discrepancies do not change the core issues in this case - that Bitfinex and Tether misled their clients and investors - they only heighten the OAG's need to obtain documents and information in a timely, organized fashion so that the OAG may understand what has taken place, and what continues to take place, at these companies.""    450545 2019 in the Matter of the I v in the Matter of the I MEMORANDUM of LAW I 56 by CoinDesk on Scribd    NY Attorney General Letitia James image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | USDT,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/04/nyag-bitfinex-should-be-made-to-disclose-tether-deal-documents,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e6a5ac6e5368eb21c9c546ade049ca40ad309c32-1500x1145.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381814,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pqhX,1556984958,'Not a White Paper': Marketing Document Details $1 Billion Bitfinex Token Sale,"New details are emerging about a planned $1 billion token sale to be held by iFinex, the parent company of Bitfinex and Tether, two cryptocurrency companies currently being sued by the state of New York for allegedly covering up a $850 million loss in customer funds.  Released today on Twitter by known company shareholder and over-the-counter trader Zhao Dong, a 3-page ""marketing document"" details the specifics of how the sale might ultimately take place, while noting throughout that it is not intended to be legally binding.  For example, the document makes explicit that it is ""not a white paper,"" meaning it does not provide technical specifics including which blockchain or blockchains the new cryptocurrency for sale will trade on, or the cryptographic specifics of how its code will enable peers to move and transfer funds.  According to the document, the tokens are to be issued by Unus Sed Leo Limited, a new company owned by iFinex. In total, 1 billion tokens will be issued by Unus Sed Leo Limited, each selling for 1 USDT, the US-dollar backed stablecoin issued by Tether.  The exchange said:  ""The tokens will be sold in a private offering without the means of general solicitation or general advertising. Any tokens that remain issued may be sold in the manner and times determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion.""  The cryptocurrency, to trade under the ticker symbol LEO, will enable users to receive discounts on trading fees when swapping between cryptocurrencies on Bitfinex exchange and its two cryptocurrency-specific exchanges, EthFinex and EOSFinex.  However, in a move that recalls how it issued tokens in the wake of its August 2016 hack, Bitfinex indicated the tokens will be created as a temporary measure, and that the company intends to buy back tokens as a means of ensuring customers are ultimately refunded.  At the time, Bitfinex issued roughly $72 million in 'BFX tokens,' cryptocurrency that was eventually bought back based on proceeds from exchange revenues by April 2017.  This time around, IFinex and its affiliates will buy back the tokens on a monthly basis. Purchases will be made monthly, ""equal to a minimum of 27 percent of the consolidated gross revenues of iFinex from the previous month, until no more than 100 million LEO tokens remain.""  The document continues: ""Repurchases will be made at then-prevailing market rates. LEO tokens used to pay fees may also be burned.""  In response to allegations by the New York Attorney General's Office (NYAG), iFinex officials maintain that the funds lost are actually being held by regulators, having been ""seized and safeguarded"" from Crypto Capital, a third-party banking and payment services provider whose apparent legal issues first spurred Bitfinex to borrow funds from Tether.  Any funds recovered will be used to ""repurchase and burn"" outstanding LEO tokens, the document says.  Notably, the document does not suggest that the company will not move to create its own permanent blockchain, as have other exchanges like Binance for the purpose of seeking new revenue opportunities related to new cryptocurrency issuance.  A more detailed version of the history of Bitfinex and the recent allegations of the company can be found in an accounting by reporter Amy Castor.  CoinDesk reached out to representatives of Bitfinex, but did not receive an immediate reply. Zhao declined to provide further details when reached.

The new hire, Chris Tyrer, joined Fidelity at the end of April, according to his LinkedIn profile update. The profile, however, does not mention any further details on the role, except the mention of “Digital Assets.”  Tyrer worked as the head and managing director of digital assets project at Barclays for about eight months and left the firm in August 2018. Prior to that, he was the head of commodity trading at the bank between 2015-2017.  This is not Tyrer's first time at Barclays. He first joined the bank back in 2001 and worked there until 2011 as the director and global head of crude oil trading. Later, for about 3 years, he also worked at commodity trading company Mercuria Energy Group as a senior crude oil trader, before returning to Barclays in 2015, according to the profile.  In his most recent role at Barclays, Tyrer reportedly worked on exploring the cryptocurrency space.  Barclays planned to launch a cryptocurrency trading desk last year, but later the bank’s CEO pushed back saying that there are no immediate plans to open the desk.  Just last month, Fidelity also hired Coinbase’s director of institutional sales, Christine Sandler.

42430461,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMtE5h,1556956804,"Binance, OKEx and KuCoin Are Using IEOs to Command the Spotlight","Token sales haven’t stopped since the 2017 boom. They’ve just changed names.  Initial exchange offerings (IEOs) – where a cryptocurrency exchange offers a direct listing and launch campaign for a new startup token – are earning blockchain companies millions in 2019.  Two sources, who both requested anonymity to avoid alienating exchange partners, told CoinDesk that some exchanges declined to list their tokens unless their startups paid hefty fees, in various formats depending on the exchange. These fees, the sources said, ranged from 10 percent of the startup’s equity, plus a percentage of the token’s global market cap, to over $1 million for “marketing.”  One such anonymous source said that exchanges are looking to compete with ethereum, which has been primarily used thus far for creating new assets.  “Basically they are going after the ERC-20 [token standard],” the source said of the Malta-based exchange Binance. “They want you to actually issue a Binance token [BNB], on top of the Binance chain instead of an ERC-20, in order to get into the [decentralized exchange business].”  The ecosystem’s most famous IEO platform is the “Launchpad” division of Binance. The Launchpad originally started in August 2017, and reopened with the BitTorrent offering that facilitated $7.2 million in sales with the exchange’s native BNB token in January 2019.  Since then, Binance has launched four new projects and is marching ahead with at least one a month as it simultaneously develops a decentralized exchange (DEX).  Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) told CoinDesk the Launchpad has received “thousands” of applications. Yet so far, the value of these new tokens plummeted soon after the IEO took place.  When asked how much it costs a startup to secure a Launchpad IEO, and whether those teams are required to use the exchange’s native blockchain or BNB exclusively, CZ said that “each sale is unique.”  “We evaluate each project individually,” CZ said. “Some projects require more help from us, such as advisory, token economics, etc. Some projects are more independent. … We built Launchpad because we believe fundraising on blockchain is one of the best tools for entrepreneurs.”  Speaking to the broader comparison between IEOs and ICOs, he added:  “In IEOs, exchanges conduct an additional level of due diligence to help investors in selecting and evaluating projects.”  Competition  Now global competitors such as Bittrex, KuCoin and OKEx all offer IEOs as well, although their formats vary.  For example, according to Huobi Group’s head of marketing Ross Zhang, Huobi’s token launch format called “Huobi Prime” isn’t an IEO (despite most traders calling it that) because Prime doesn’t raise funds for external startups.  Zhang told CoinDesk that so far both Prime offerings promptly sold out, exchanging 3.5 billion startup tokens for Huobi’s native token.  Meanwhile, in contrast to Binance’s Launchpad, KuCoin’s comparable Spotlight division will launch its third IEO on May 28, featuring the CHROMA token issued by the software-as-service startup ChromaWay, which already garnered $11 million in a private token sale last year.  KuCoin CEO Michael Gan told CoinDesk the exchange’s first IEO in April raised $4.2 million worth of crypto. However, it’s more accurate to think of such sums as a rate of distribution rather than earnings. It’s unclear how much exchanges themselves earn from IEOs.  In addition to transaction fees, terms are determined through private discussions rather than standardized procedures, according to both CZ and an anonymous source that pitched multiple exchanges.  The second anonymous source said several exchanges are switching to prioritize IEOs and no longer considering new or niche assets for general listings.  Describing the challenges of convincing an exchange to list a new or niche token without the exclusivity of an IEO, ChromaWay COO Or Perelman said:  “Most of the top exchanges are basically looking at their personal IEO projects.”  Trusted curators  To be fair, these exchanges do contribute professional screening and marketing services for the sale. Plus, sometimes exchanges don't charge for IEOs.  Indeed, ChromaWay’s Perelman told CoinDesk that startups need IEOs for “liquidity and marketing,” and that KuCoin doesn’t charge fees.  For yet another example, Andy Cheung, head of operations at OKEx, told CoinDesk his exchange does not charge startups for IEOs even though the company received hundreds of applications.  Speaking of how IEOs attract traction for the exchange’s native token, Cheung said sale participants must have a minimum of 500 OKB tokens to qualify to participate in the IEO. Furthermore, the OKEx IEOs, expected to occur at least once a month for the rest of the year, will only accept OKB tokens. Both KuCoin and OKEx are following Binance’s lead by prioritizing usage of their native tokens and also developing their own DEXs in the meantime.  “We believe [IEOs] will bring new users to the community,” Cheung said. “We can actually help [users] select a good project. It won’t be like the old days where someone who does an initial coin offering runs away.”  According to Huobi’s Zhang, two years after the token boom of 2017 there is still an “enormous appetite” among retail traders eager for early access to digital assets. He said:  “The difference this time around is that people are, on the whole, a lot more cautious and careful about where they put their funds.”  KuCoin image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,BNB | OKB,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | BNB | OKB | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/04/binance-okex-and-kucoin-are-using-ieos-to-command-the-spotlight,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/13c27ac672443814f6af85e521dd9b019ff445fb-1500x831.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
