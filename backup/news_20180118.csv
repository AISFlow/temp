42428445,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL80Xh,1516315514,Bitcoin Devs Release Long-Awaited Schnorr Paper for Scalability Gains,"A new research paper focused on Schnorr multi-signatures and penned by several notable bitcoin developers has just been released.  Published on Thursday, the paper was penned by cryptographer Yannick Seurin and developers Gregory Maxwell, Andrew Poelstra and Pieter Wuille. It details how Schnorr multi-signatures can be applied to the bitcoin, and though there's no guarantee they will ultimately be utilized, this new release could mark an additional step in that direction.  Specifically, the Schnorr concept proposes bundling signatures into one small data entry, rather than having multiple signatures listed individually. This has the result of saving space on the blockchain, enabling it to process more signatures while increasing security, according to the paper.  Security is increased by enabling a multi-signature system, wherein at least two parties need to confirm a transaction for it to process. This limits or prevents malicious parties from launching a transaction on another user’s account.  The paper's authors note:  “The size of the multi-signature in that case grows linearly with the number of signers. In order to be useful and practical, a multi-signature scheme should produce signatures whose size is (ideally) independent from the number of signers and close to the one of an ordinary signature scheme.”  Schnorr signatures could provide additional benefits as well if implemented, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  Bunching data with one signature can limit spam on the blockchain. In other words, rather than having many small blocks of data sent to the network, one single chunk is sent, which can be processed more quickly.  Similarly, bunching data from different sources can enhance privacy by making it more difficult to trace any single transaction back to its source.

In a call for public input on contracts for differences (CFDs), ESMA says it is looking into how CFDs for cryptocurrencies would comply with their Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MFID) regulatory framework, according to a release. Under a CFD, one party agrees to pay the other party if the value of the asset the contract is based on changes.  Specifically, ESMA is looking for input on whether cryptocurrency-based CFDs should have strict restrictions, noting in its statement:  ""In this context ESMA is currently discussing whether CFDs on cryptocurrencies, whose underlying assets have displayed very high price variation, should be addressed in the measures and whether a 5:1 initial leverage would provide investors with sufficient protection. Alternatively, a lower leverage limit (2:1 or 1:1) or stricter measures (such as a prohibition on the marketing, distribution or sale of CFDs in cryptocurrencies to retail clients) could be considered.""  According to the document, a 5:1 initial leverage means an investor would only have to pay 20 percent of the CFD’s total value. The broker handling the investment, in that case, would then lend the investor the remaining balance for the CFD.  The document went on to note that a 2:1 or 1:1 limit might provide better protections for investors.  At the same time, the document noted, the safest course of action may be to bar retail clients from investing in CFDs entirely, and ESMA wants feedback on this potential option as well.  Last year, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority warned investors who were considering crypto-based CFDs, calling them “extremely high-risk, speculative investments.""

From there, users can choose their gas prices and tokens, and transfer their coins using the Radar app.  Thus far, the integration has won plaudits from some quarters of the cryptocurrency community.

42428443,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL80Th,1516292444,TSMC Expects 'Strong' Crypto Mining Demand to Continue,"The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has reported strong financial results in the fourth quarter, thanks in part to demand from cryptocurrency mining.  In a Jan. 18 statement, the world's largest independent semiconductor foundry said that it generated NT$277.57 billion (roughly $9.2 billion) in revenue during the fourth quarter, representing a year-over-year increase of 5.9%.  On the hardware shipping front, TSMC said that its ""advanced technologies,"" constituting wafers in excess of 28-nanometers, represented 63% of total wafer revenue.  Lora Ho, TSMC's senior vice president and chief financial officer, attributed the results to demand from cryptocurrency miners – who, through the energy-intensive mining process, add new transactions to blockchains and thereby mint new coins in the process as a reward – as well as mobile product launches.  According to Ho, that demand is expected to continue into 2018.  She was quoted as saying:  ""Our fourth quarter business was supported by major mobile product launches and continuing demand for cryptocurrency mining. Moving into first quarter 2018, we expect the strong demand for cryptocurrency mining will continue while mobile product seasonality will dampen our business in this quarter.""  The results mark a continuance of TSMC's performance – thanks in part to mining demand – as the company reported similar findings after the third quarter of 2017. At the time, TSMC reported a third-quarter revenue of $8.32 billion.

As of writing, XRP is trading at $1.57. The world's third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has appreciated by 56 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. More impressive has been XRP's 77 percent recovery from the 3.5 week low of $0.897797 hit yesterday.  However, the cryptocurrency is still down 17 percent on a weekly basis, while year-to-date, XRP has depreciated by 31 percent.  Meanwhile, Stellar's XLM token has appreciated by 53 percent in the last 24 hour. XLM was last seen changing hands at $0.535388. As of writing, prices are up 80 percent from yesterday's 2.5 week low of $0.305034.  That said, XLM is largely unchanged week-on-week. Also, on a year-to-date basis, the world's ninth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 48.41 percent.  Ripple 4-hour chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  The 50-day moving average (MA) carries a strong bearish bias (sloping downwards).  A bearish crossover between 50-MA and 100-MA (long-term average cuts short-term average from above).  The 200-day MA has shed bullish bias and is currently neutral (flatlined).  XRP is trading above the head-and-shoulders neckline.  The descending trend line is still intact.  View  Lower highs as represented by descending trend line and bearish MA indicate the bears are still in the game.  A quick move above $2.25 (right shoulder high) would add credence to the sharp recovery from $0.85 and turn the tide in favor of the bulls.  On the other hand, a failure to hold above the head-and-shoulders neckline, followed by a break below $1.20, could yield a deeper sell-off to $0.60 levels. A violation there would expose $0.30 (head-and-shoulders breakdown target).  Stellar chart  The above chart (prices calculated by TradingView) shows:  Descending channel (price action contained between two downward sloping lines) is intact.  Bearish 50-day and 100-day MA crossover.  50-day MA carries a strong bearish bias (sloping downwards).  100-day and 200-day MA have topped out, but are neutral (flat).  View  Despite the recovery from the low of $0.29, the outlook for Stellar remains bearish as indicated by above technical points.  Only a multiple 4-hour closes above $0.60 (upside break of descending channel) would abort the bearish view and open thedoors for $0.90–$1.00.  Meanwhile, the sell-off could resume if prices drop below $0.40. In such a scenario, prices could drop to $0.24 (falling channel support).

The announcement of AntPool mining support comes alongside the news that China's mining chip giant Bitmain, which owns AntPool, has launched a new mining hardware device, dubbed the AntMiner A3. Data shows that, currently, AntPool accounts for 18 percent of the global bitcoin hashing power.  Siacoin is the native token of the sia blockchain, developed by Boston-based blockchain startup Nebulous to support its decentralized cloud storage system.  According to Bitmain, the new 815 GH/s miner supports the ""blake2b"" hashing algorithm, which is also used to secure the siacoin blockchain.  However, the launch appears to be not well-received by at least one member of the siacoin development team.  One representative, going by the pseudonym ""Taek42"" on Reddit, argued that Bitmain might put profit ahead of the sia ecosystem. Taek42 added that the sia blockchain could be changed to block mining via the AntMiner A3, but that it would require a soft fork to do so.  While some agreed with Taek42's sentiment, others welcomed the addition of Bitmain to the sia arena.

42428457,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL80rh,1516278607,"Bitcoin Is Back Above $11,500, But Bulls Not Out of the Woods Yet","Despite a sharp price recovery to over $11,500 today, bitcoin's bulls are not out of the woods yet, the price charts suggest.  Coindesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) has climbed 25.9 percent from the eight-week low of $9,199.59 hit yesterday at 15:44 UTC. As of writing, bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $11,590 levels.  The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has appreciated by 8 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data source OnChainFX.  However, the investor community isn't convinced by the move, and comments on social media show that some believe the overnight recovery is nothing more than a ""dead cat bounce.""  The price chart analysis indicates that only a close (as per UTC) above $12,500 (prices as per Coinbase) would add credence to rebound from sub-100-day moving average (MA) levels and confirm that a short-term bottom is in place.  Bitcoin chart: Bottom in place?  The situation looks similar to that seen in mid/late March 2017, when BTC prices flirted with 100-day MA for more than a week before moving higher. Back then, the RSI was just shy of oversold conditions  Still, it appears to be too early to call a bottom.  Yesterday's long-tailed candle (big difference between intraday low and UTC close) does show strong dip demand. However, only a positive close today would validate the sharp recovery from $9,005 (previous day's low).  Bitcoin chart: Bulls need a close above $12,500  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  A long-tailed candle indicating dip demand near the ascending trendline (drawn from July low and September low) support.  Lower highs and lower lows as indicated by the descending trendline and a drop below $12,500 on Tuesday.  5-day and 10-day MAs carry a strong bearish bias (sloping downwards).  The RSI remains below 50.00 (in the bearish territory).  Except for the first point, all other factors favor a drop to $8,690–$8,052 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 rally).  View  The recovery from $9,005 has neutralized the immediate bearish outlook.  The daily chart suggests that a historical pattern (higher lows along the 100-day MA) could be repeated.

Choi Heung-sik, governor of the FSS, said the regulator – an executive arm of the Financial Services Commission – will make public any findings on the allegations of illegal trading of cryptocurrency by one of its staff members.  According to the Korea Times, Choi said:  ""We've acknowledged allegations that an FSS official sold crypto-assets based on insider information before the government's updated announcement to regulate the market. We are looking into this case.""  The news source also cited Hong Nam-ki, minister of the office for government policy coordination, as saying that policies on trading digital currencies vary between government offices, and it will take time to develop a unified policy on the matter.  Yonhap  news agency also indicates that multiple staff may have been involved in insider trading.  The alleged insider trading is said to have occurred prior to Korean regulators announcing new rules on cryptocurrency trading in the country – a move that has been, at least in part, linked to the recent slump in prices across the crypto markets.  With the restrictions, banks have faced closer scrutiny over their relationships with cryptocurrency exchanges, and holders of anonymous virtual accounts must now attach their identity or face fines. A possible ban of cryptocurrency exchange trading is still being considered, according to officials, and a decision is expected to be made during Thursday's parliamentary session, Reuters says.

Speaking at a panel on Tuesday, VA's chief technology officer, Charles Worthington, said his focus is more on finding the appropriate technology to solve the department's problems, as reported by GovernmentCIO Magazine.  He continued:  ""We really would be looking to industry to surface use cases for us … I think we're going to be coming to industry with problems we have, and if you think blockchain is an appropriate solution, bring it to us.""  The chief problems faced by the department are interoperability and sharing health information between entities, Worthington explained. While VA has tried to solve these issues in the past, he believes anyone trying to apply blockchain would encounter the same stumbling blocks that faced other solutions over the last two decades.  ""We're really looking to industry for the best ideas, and trying to be nimble enough to take advantage of those as the market evolves,"" Worthington said.  While he is interested in what industry can provide in terms of blockchain solutions, he said, he is more interested in how the technology can solve problems people are not even thinking about yet.  Worthington sees the development of solutions to these new ideas as a ""missing middle"" between blockchain technology today and its use in health record interoperability, he said.  At present, there are just not that many use cases for blockchain within the department, he added.  A bill introduced in the House in 2016 would have had the department use a blockchain ledger to store appointment information. However, while the bill was agreed in committee, it has not been passed or voted on in two years.

42428440,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL80Ph,1516266011,Enterprise Blockchain Is Ready to Go Live in 2018,"Mark Rakhmilevich is Senior Director of Blockchain Product Management at Oracle. He's working on Oracle Blockchain Cloud Service and guides enterprises, ISVs, and SIs in building blockchain applications and integrating enterprise systems with this platform.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      Talk to enterprise blockchain enthusiasts and they will tell you about the potential use cases in their industries and the proofs-of-concept they have run to prove blockchain value in the enterprise.  Ask them about production deployments… and they demur, pointing out implementation challenges and production-readiness gaps.  Will this change in 2018 and will we see a significant shift from experimentation to production deployments of enterprise blockchains?  In numerous customer conversations during 2017, the challenges to moving even successful use cases from successful PoCs to pilots and production boil down to five areas of enterprise-grade requirements: performance at scale, operational resilience, security and confidentiality, supportability and management, and enterprise integration.  Enterprises experimenting with blockchain use cases are recognizing the need to address these challenges, and in 2017, some vendors, (including my company, Oracle), announced blockchain platforms focused on these requirements.  With all of the enhancements coming in enterprise blockchain platforms, 2018 will be the year enterprise blockchain goes live and businesses can move from experimenting to production.  Performance at scale  Many enterprise systems handle business transactions at a rate of hundreds or thousands per second. For example, a large Asian telecom handles more than 100,000 billing and mobile payments transactions per second (tps), and a major credit card processor was running over 13,000 tps at peak a number of years ago. Naturally enterprises are concerned about creating large blockchain networks with hundreds or thousands of members, handling growing transaction volumes, and providing sub-second transaction latency.  While today's blockchain applications may not require these throughput levels, most real-world blockchains do not even approach 100 tps – bitcoin averages 7 tps and ethereum is about twice that, while the transaction wait times (latency) can run into minutes or hours. Enterprise blockchains not only need much higher throughput, but also transaction latency of less than a second for many businesses use cases.  Reaching beyond these limitations requires an architectural approach that uses separation of concerns (different types of work are done in separate, independently scalable servers or containers), leverages asynchronous flows, exploits parallelization, uses faster consensus protocols, and runs on optimized execution environments.  Some of these architectural principles are already present in Hyperledger Fabric, a Linux Foundation project that Oracle joined in 2017, but more can be done leveraging the experience from those same systems delivering hundreds and thousands of tps at many enterprises to reach the transaction throughput and latency enterprises need.  In addition, scaling a permissioned blockchain, where all members are linked to legal entities, to dozens or hundreds of participants also requires a robust and efficient on-boarding process. Enterprise PoCs rarely include more than a dozen participants on a single blockchain.  Some onboarding processes make assumptions and take short cuts that do not withstand real-world scrutiny, so effective tools will be required to handle adding organizations onto the business network in production, with all the necessary verification and approvals processes, and in a streamlined way that can leverage established identity management services.  Joining members must be able to deploy their validating nodes using multiple, highly available resource pools across distributed cloud or on-site data centers in an open, hybrid environment.  Resilience  Enterprise systems are built to avoid downtime with highly available services and to recover rapidly when (not if) some components fail. Avoiding small issues leading to major outages and quick recovery from failure are key to ensuring high availability in any business-critical system. Software and hardware is subject to failures – and the first design principle of resilient systems is to assume failures will happen and to be prepared to keep the overall system running in these situations.  Traditional enterprise software from Oracle and others use replication of services and redundancy to ensure that the system survives an outage of any single and even multiple components. Similarly, deploying redundant peer nodes per member organization, clustered ordering service, and replicating other blockchain network components is an important foundation for resilient blockchain infrastructure, which is enabled with Hyperledger Fabric's architecture.  Beyond redundancy, autonomous monitoring and recoverability of failed components, as well as continuous embedded backup of configuration information and ledger data can ensure rapid autonomous resolution of most glitches without manual intervention.  Minimizing intervention is an important aspect, as research shows that around 70 percent of outages are due to human error introduced while correcting other issues or adjusting configuration.  Security and confidentiality  Security assessments of blockchain deployments look at how blockchain can restrict transactions and ledger access to authorized participants, ensure encryption of data in-transit and at-rest, and verify that network messages are tamper-proof and their digital signatures are valid.  Enterprise blockchains start with a permissioned network model, meaning that all members are known legal entities and must be enrolled though membership services, which issue enrollment certificates. These cryptographically signed certificates securely link member identity and authorization attributes with the cryptographic key that enables authentication of their digitally signed messages.  Digital signatures applied to all network messages enable all nodes and clients to verify the sender and validate message integrity. This is coupled with transport security to authenticate the communications end points and encrypt the message traffic.  Further, automatically applying encryption for the stored data completes the best practices for encrypting data in transit and at rest. When this foundation is used transparently and pervasively for all secure communications and stored ledger data, it's a big step forward in maintaining the integrity and security of the blockchain network, preventing most hacking attacks.  When a blockchain certificate authority enrolls a new member organization and issues its digital certificates, the underlying process depends on properly authenticating the organization's identity and access privileges. This requires strong identity management and key management capabilities.  Moreover, since even in secure environments credentials can be stolen via spearfishing or social engineering attacks, a certificate revocation mechanism must be available as an integral part of the solution to prevent the use of compromised certificates.  Further, securing ongoing access to blockchain REST APIs or operations interfaces from external client applications or admin users requires strong multi-layered access control – with logical, physical, and data security controls, coupled with adaptive or behavioral authentication – comparing users' behavior to historical patterns and generating alerts for significant deviations.  In addition to external security, enterprise blockchain must have the ability to conduct confidential transactions, e.g., using channels in Hyperledger Fabric, which insulate peer nodes and maintain private ledgers that are only accessible to other peers on the same channel.  Additional important capabilities, such as fine-grained authorizations for enforcement of access control within a smart contract, private peer-to-peer interactions that limit visibility of transaction information from other peers and selective encryption of the sensitive data for restricted access by authorized peers, are necessary to further enhance data and transaction privacy.  Supportability  Once an organization builds a PoC and proves the value of applying blockchain to a particular use case, how does it put it into production to achieve the promised results?  Who's going to assemble, harden, and support the blockchain network components, and all their supporting infrastructure? Who will provide troubleshooting, day-to-day administration and monitoring, and deal with patching or upgrades to new versions? With a production blockchain, operations and supportability become critical, including blockchain operations and dynamic configuration, ability to monitor service-level agreements, troubleshoot anomalies, and manage a patching/upgrade lifecycle with backward compatibility.  One answer is blockchain as a managed service (BaaS), which leverages a service provider's ready-to-deploy infrastructure and operations capabilities to manage, monitor, patch, and maintain the infrastructure, while enterprises focus on the application-delivered value of using the blockchain.  The service provider would integrate and maintain the foundational technologies required to run the blockchain, monitor and troubleshoot the blockchain network, and provide an operations interface for the members to perform dynamic configuration, monitor SLAs, and manage policies as well as tools to manage smart contract lifecycle – deploy initial chaincode, upgrade to a new version, etc.  Integration  Many of the multi-party processes and business-to-business interactions that would benefit from using blockchain touch a number of enterprise systems of record (SORs.)  In the near term, blockchain will extend rather than replace many current enterprise systems of record (e.g., core banking, enterprise resource planning, supply chain management, human capital management.) But building these integrations one by one is very complex and costly. Business need pre-built onramps for enterprise systems and modern event and API-driven integration methods to invoke transactions, share data, and capture blockchain events and ledger updates into systems of record (SORs)  For example, a shipping transaction initiated in a supply chain management system can trigger a blockchain transaction to update the order information and related metadata stored in distributed ledger. In an outbound integration example, an account transfer associated with an invoice settlement in a blockchain system may emit an event to update an internal general ledger account.  Turning an isolated blockchain PoC into a fully fledged part of the enterprise IT depends on ability to simplify and accelerate such integrations. Application integration toolkits that address typical business processes and events is one promising approach.  This can be further extended with API-driven development that relies on managed API platform using REST APIs for invoking blockchain transactions and querying the distributed ledger. These can help to quickly deliver new applications that drive enterprise innovation and integrate existing back-end systems, such as General Ledgers, ERPs, SCM, and other systems that are key to information sharing and transactions with external organizations.  Conclusion  Last year saw a lot of blockchain experimentation in the form of PoCs and pilots in financial services, supply chain and a number of other industries as well as government operations (e.g., the U.S. General Services Administration's FASt Lane process for IT Schedule 70 contracts).  For these to move toward production in 2018, the technology needs to mature in the key areas outlined above. But open source consortia like Hyperledger and enterprise software vendors like us at Oracle are stepping up to the challenge to deliver on these requirements.  Together we will help enterprises fully adopt blockchain technology as a part of their business-critical IT systems.

Introduced on Jan. 16, Senate Bill 086 suggests that using a distributed ledger would eliminate the need for paper records and in-person updating of such data. The blockchain system would subsequently solve the state's existing data collection and retention issues, and create a more secure record.  If passed, the bill would direct Colorado's chief information security officer to evaluate the costs and benefits of using distributed ledgers in various government systems, and to determine blockchain's capability in handling cyberattacks compared to traditional computer systems.  In 2017, according to the bill, there were somewhere between six and eight million attempted breaches of the Colorado state government's digital platforms per day.  Many of the records kept by the government are unsecured, and therefore are ""valuable targets for identity thieves and hackers with the intent to steal or penetrate corporate records."" The bill went on to note that there is an increasing number of threats to steal personal information.  In addition, the bill pointed out that Colorado currently still requires citizens to visit state agencies in person to modify their information, a pain-point that can be solved by a blockchain system.  The bill went on:  ""Blockchain distributed ledgers provide the capability of openly traceable transactions while maintaining the privacy of each person performing the transactions.""

42428453,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL80nh,1516257039,Report: South Korea Could Decide This Week on Crypto Exchange Regulation,"South Korea could make a decision on Thursday over its stance on cryptocurrency exchange regulation, according to a report by Reuters.  Responding to a parliament member at the national policy committee meeting today, Choi Jong-ku, head of South Korea's Financial Services Commission, explained how such regulation may play out, reportedly saying:  “(The government) is considering both shutting down all local virtual currency exchanges or just the ones who have been violating the law.”  The comment indicates the government is moving to clear the recent confusion around cryptocurrency regulation in South Korea, mainly created by conflicting comments issued by different government bodies.  As reported before, on Jan. 11, the South Korean Ministry of Justice reportedly confirmed a plan to shut down all cryptocurrency exchanges. Yet soon the South Korea's Presidential Office commented that such a policy has not been finalized. As reported by CoinDesk previously, the unclear situation has also brought backlash from local residents and politicians.  According to the report, Hong Nam-ki, minister of the office for government policy coordination, said while government officials still hold different opinions over the issue, the meeting today expects to reach a decision on a cryptocurrency exchange regulation.  Elsewhere in the country today, South Korea's central bank made a comment that may signal a different approach on how the country may make use of cryptocurrency and its underlying technology.  According to Reuters, Lee Ju-yeol, governor of Bank of Korea said in a news conference on Thursday that while cryptocurrency so far is not a legal currency, the bank has been involved in researching a central bank-issued cryptocurrency.  ""We have started looking at virtual currency from a long-term standpoint, as central banks could start issuing digital currencies in the future.

42380275,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MdIN,1516252968,Blockchain Bloat: How Ethereum Is Tackling Storage Issues,"24,270 tokens. 27,358 pending transactions. 463,713 digital kittens.  Ethereum has hosted a lot of activity recently, and while many crypto enthusiasts see that as a positive sign, as the network's usage soars, its history gets longer and its blockchain more unruly.  And although network congestion leading to transaction backlogs and rising fees has taken the spotlight, there's another issue this scale causes – a growing database that puts significant storage costs on users wanting to run a full node.  That database, called the ethereum state, hold all the computations that need to be memorized by the computers supporting the platform and the ethereum blockchain itself. And with the costs (both in time and money) of storing the state increasing, fewer and fewer people are choosing to run full nodes, which many worry will centralize the network into the hands of only a few arbitrators.  And developers recognize the problem.  For one thing, ethereum developers are well underway engineering protocol-level changes such as sharding, aimed at minimizing the database.  But since these technologies are still in development, other stakeholders, namely those running ethereum clients – the software needed for users to communicate with the blockchain – have been under fresh pressure to cope with the growth of the state database.  ""The fact that improving this stuff is critical has been known since late 2016, the ideas have been floating around for half a year to over a year. Where are the implementations?"" said ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin on a developer channel recently.  The frustration is palpable with both Buterin and Afri Schoedon, who manages technical communications at ethereum software client provider Parity. Schoedon told CoinDesk:  ""At the current growth rate it's predictable that the state is going to grow very fast this year, to a point where it would be hardly manageable on small devices.""  In an effort to limit the effects of the unwieldy state, then, the two most popular ethereum clients – Geth and Parity – have recently released updates that attempt to improve the situation.  Turbocharged  The first update, released last week by Parity, reduced storage requirements by eliminating unnecessary, temporary files produced as the software memorizes ethereum's history.  By vastly minimizing the storage requirements, users hooking up to run full nodes then experience faster synchronization times. And with that, the company said its ethereum software could now be run on a hard drive instead of a solid state drive (SSD), a particularly notable feat since long sync times have made ethereum unable to run on a hard drive since last summer.  The update even got an excited response from Buterin, who said on a developer channel, ""Wow. How did you guys accomplish that?""  As a result of the update, users have been reporting a vastly improved experience.  At the same time, independent developer Alexey Akhunov has been working on a rewrite of the geth client, called ""turbo geth."" Described by Akhunov as an ""obsession,"" the project aims to remove a lot of unnecessary repetition in how ethereums' clients process the overall state.  While it's nowhere near ready, it has opened up some interesting avenues of ""speculative optimization,"" Akhunov said in a recent developer chat.  For example, Akhunov suggests “hard coding” certain information about the ethereum state into the clients themselves. Ultimately, the goal is to adapt the software to simply run using random access memory, or RAM, which could make the clients much faster – allowing them to potentially synchronize with the network instantly.  Developers at Geth itself are also working on optimizations, for one trying to correct a quirk in how information is stored when a client syncs with the network in what is called ""fast"" mode. Described by Geth core developer Péter Szilágyi as ""really horrible,"" the existing code is likely to be replaced along with a whole bunch of updates that make synchronization much faster and less storage-intensive.  The limits  There's also research being done into a client type called ""stateless clients,"" which only store a compression of the overall state.  Even Buterin is interested in the idea, recently undertaking a study that describes a scenario where ""miners and full nodes in general no longer need to store any state."" Plus, Buterin said later in a developer channel, stateless clients would also alleviate the need to clear up the state by other measures, such as pruning old, irrelevant data, for example, empty or long-inactive accounts.  ""I'm now in favor of the stateless client approach,"" Buterin wrote.  And there is even speculation that stateless clients might be possible without making protocol-level changes.  Touting such clients as a possible solution to the scaling hurdles faced by ethereum following the success of CryptoKitties, Akhunov wrote in a recent blog post: ""I believe (stateless clients) can be implemented already now, without any hard fork, 'simply' by changing the ethereum clients ... This means that nodes do not need to access storage from files and block validation times should drop significantly.""  However, client optimizations can't be the only thing the network relies on to decrease state concerns.  According to Szilágyi  , eventually, client optimizations will reach their limit. And then developers will have to turn their attention to in-progress technologies, such as sharding, which splits up the ethereum database into smaller pieces stored at different nodes, in an effort to alleviate the pressure of storing the full database on individual clients.  Perhaps in response to the recent strains on the network, sharding development has advanced in recent months, with an early stage specification sketched out on Github.  ""We can optimize the database and make it ten times faster and more optimal, which gives us room to grow to ten times our current size,"" Szilágyi said, adding:  ""But eventually, we will get to the point where we won't be able to do database optimizations anymore, and by that time we need to be able to shard our data.""

42380265,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Md5n,1516233612,3 (Possible) Reasons the Crypto Markets Tanked This Week,"$300 billion.  Poof. Gone in 36 hours.  This week's cryptocurrency market crash erased paper fortunes and likely churned a few stomachs belonging to new investors who had been piling into the space.  While the market has been in a frenzy over the past few months – with the majority of coins reaching all-time-highs while the market caps of cryptocurrencies with little technical development (Dogecoin) and niche business opportunity (Dentacoin) surged past $1 billion in network value – starting Tuesday morning, it began shedding weight.  Lots and lots of it, in fact. Most of the major cryptocurrencies saw double-digit drops continuing until Wednesday. The two most popular cryptocurrencies (and the two largest by market cap), bitcoin and ethereum, dipped below the psychological price levels surpassed last year – $10,000 and $1,000, respectively.  And XRP, the native cryptocurrency of enterprise blockchain startup Ripple Inc., lost nearly 50 percent of its value on Tuesday, after a month-long bull run that made the coin a retail investor darling and the apple of a startup's eye.  As always, crypto-enthusiasts took to social media to restate their HODL-ing patterns and declare that this, in fact, is a great time to buy.  But others, who haven't held on through the ups and downs of the last four-plus years, and might even have been some of the reason (i.e., panic selling) the markets tanked so hard, might be wondering what just happened.  And as the markets begin to regain some of their position going into Wednesday night, it's hard to pinpoint anything specific, but there's a confluence of events surmised to have driven the couple days of red.  Bitter taste of regs  By far, the most prevalent explanation is that harsh stances by governments in China and more recently, South Korea, led many investors to flee.  China, for one, has caused the markets to drop in the past. For instance, when the People's Bank of China banned payment companies from working with bitcoin exchanges in 2013, the market immediately dipped.  And although there was some market clamor in September when China banned initial coin offerings (ICOs) and moved to shut down crypto exchanges in the country, the market for cryptocurrency trading has diversified significantly, and as such, the markets took far less time to recover.  More recently, though, South Korea regulators have been hammering on the crypto industry all month, with banks facing scrutiny over crypto exchange relationships and investors facing fines for anonymous trading accounts, the latter of which was disclosed on Monday.  Still, any news of strict regulation will ""add pressure to the downside,"" said Lanre Sarumi, CEO at risk management system providers Riskbone and the CEO of Leveltradingfield, which designed a game that allows people to place bets on the future price of bitcoin.  And Michael Graham, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, an investment bank in New York, echoed that sentiment, saying that the regulatory rumblings have ""helped people start to create more of a cautious narrative that's sort of feeding on itself.""  Back to the futures?  Secondly – and perhaps interesting in its counterintuitiveness – is that far more technical people are a part of the cryptocurrency markets now, and according to Sarumi, that demographic shift of sorts could be exacerbating the downturn.  While the interest in cryptocurrencies by these sophisticated investors has been widely seen as a beneficial development, their use of complex market tools can have effects on the price that many in the crypto scene, especially novice retail investors, might not see as positive.  For instance, more experienced investors ""are putting their stop loss triggers at support levels,"" Sarumi said.  A stop loss is an order placed with a broker to sell an asset when it reaches a certain price. If a significant number of investors have stop losses around the same price, and if the price dips below that number, those sell orders are placed at once without demand on the other side. The sell-off could trigger others to panic sell, as they might think the market is crashing.  Sarumi continued:  ""Once those levels are breached, the stop orders flood the market adding additional pressure to the downside.""  Plus, the debut of bitcoin futures on Cboe and CME last month was also viewed with optimism, as a sign of the industry maturing, but the expiration of the futures contracts this week was a source of some trepidation.  Because the futures product is so new, and the development of derivatives is key to the crypto markets’ maturation, some were ""nervous about the first expiration,"" Graham said. ""If we can get through a few closings, it will give people confidence"" in the crypto sector. (Earlier today, Cboe's first bitcoin futures contract expired.)  In this way, there isn't yet a huge number of institutional investors jumping in that would keep the market more stable.  Lights out at exchanges  The increased interest in cryptocurrencies has also put a strain on market infrastructure.  ""Pretty much all the companies in the space are facing the influx of new users … and it's taken a toll on most companies,"" said Nejc Kodric, CEO of Bitstamp, a crypto exchange which has been around since 2011.  For one, several exchanges have stopped taking new users. Bitfinex, for example, temporarily curtailed account registrations in December “in a move designed to preserve the trading, support, and verification experiences of our existing, long-term user base,” the company said in a blog post last week. It said Friday it had resumed new account openings.  And further, many users of the U.S.-based crypto exchange Kraken were up in arms when a software upgrade, which was supposed to take two hours lasted nearly two days, halting trading for the same time period.
