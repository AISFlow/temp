42373903,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvW9rv,1662150873,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Trades Down After Initial Push Higher,"Price Action  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) both declined slightly on Friday, as investors digested the latest U.S. jobs report that showed the unemployment rate inched up slightly but not enough to change the tenor of the still hot labor market.  Bitcoin declined 1.1% on Friday, after popping 1% in the hour the U.S. jobs report. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap was recently trading at just below $20,000, up a few fractions of a percentage point over the last 24 hours but well within the range it has occupied for the past week. Year to date, the price of bitcoin is down 57%  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was recently trading at just under $1,600, up about a percentage point from the previous day. ETH was initially up about 2% after the release of the employment data. Ether is up about 3% over the last seven days and down 58% year to date.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Jobs growth slowed in August, with 315,000 jobs added, compared with 526,000 jobs added in July, although the total for August beat analysts’ estimates of a gain of 300,000. The unemployment rate rose to 3.7%, versus an expected 3.5% rate, although labor-force participation ticked up to 62.4% from 62.1% in July.  The U-6 unemployment rate, arguably a more comprehensive measure of unemployment, rose to 7% from 6.7%. The U-6 rate includes the unemployed and underemployed, as well as part-time workers who are marginally attached to the labor force, and attempts to account for those individuals overlooked by other labor indexes.  Historically, the U-6 rate is higher than the headline unemployment rate, because it takes more of the eligible labor force into account.  Manufacturing payrolls exceeded expectations with 22,000 new jobs versus an expected 18,000. Government payrolls increased by 7,000, down 85% from July’s increase and 65% lower than the expected 20,000. Average hourly earnings increased 5.2%, versus expectations of a 5.1% increase.  The impact to digital asset valuations revolves around the Federal Reserve’s stance on inflation and how that is affected by the economic data.  Traditional financial markets were down, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 fell 1.1% and 1%, respectively. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index declined 1.3%  Crude oil prices ended a three-day slide, rising 0.38%, while natural gas declined 4.2%. Copper futures fell 0.13%, and the price of gold, a safe haven asset, rose 0.68%.  Altcoins were mixed, as solana (SOL) and Polygon’s MATIC fell 0.9% and 0.6%, respectively, and uniswap (UNI) rose 0.49%  Latest Prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $19,909 −0.2%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,558 −1.1%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 3,924.26 −1.1%      ●Gold: $1,721 per troy ounce +1.4%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.19% −0.07      Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  Bitcoin shrugs off jobs report following an initial move higher.  Bitcoin’s price bounced between positive and negative territory on Friday. Following the release of U.S. jobs data, the price rose as high as $20,400 before retracing below $20,000 by midday.  The jobs report, solid by most accounts, doesn't appear to signal any change in the prospect for a rate hike by the Fed later this month. The labor market remains resilient, despite its slower pace of growth. The U.S. central bank has been weighing the strength of the labor market heavily in its interest rate considerations.  The increased unemployment rate likely stems from the corresponding increase in labor force participation, also a sign of economic strength.  As the Fed wrestles with monetary policy that tames inflation but doesn’t cast the economy into recession, bitcoin and other risky assets have traded relatively flat.  A look at BTC’s hourly chart shows the sharp uptick in prices during the 12:00 UTC hour, followed by a decline of greater magnitude during the day.  Overlaying Bollinger Bands on the hourly chart shows that BTC breached the upper range of its Bollinger Band following the data release and subsequently reverted to the lower band during the 17:00 UTC hour.  Bollinger Bands measure an asset’s average price movement and then calculates two standard deviations above and below that average. Prices breaching the upper or lower limit of their Bollinger Bands are often viewed as a signal that prices have moved too far in one direction.  As stated in Thursday’s Market Wrap, bitcoin appears to be poised to bounce above and below the $20,000 mark until a positive (or negative) catalyst pushes the price beyond its current level.  Meanwhile, on-chain data shows that bitcoin exchange reserves have risen by about 20,300 since Monday. The movement of BTC onto exchanges may be a bearish signal. It can often indicate the movement of BTC out of cold storage and on to exchanges for the purpose of being sold.

42411724,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfX41,1662150387,What Is an IEO or IDO in Crypto?,"You might have heard of an ICO, or initial coin offering. That’s where a nascent crypto project sells coins for its new blockchain or tokens to run on another one like Ethereum or BNB Chain. But those sales fell out of favor after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chased after issuers for securities violations. Lots of ICOs were scams, too, with developers abandoning their projects after raising funds, never to be seen again.  See Also: ICOs Revisited  The market needed a more secure mechanism to raise funds for tokens and tokens that directly traded on exchanges. So, in the place of the ICO arose the ""initial exchange offering,"" or IEO, and later, the initial decentralized exchange (DEX) offering, or IDO. These mechanisms are similar to an ICO – token sales of new crypto projects.  The main difference is that instead of taking place on a random website, sales of new tokens take place on a trusted site. In the case of an IEO, that’s a centralized crypto exchange, like Binance. For IDOs, that’s a decentralized exchange, such as Polkastarter.  IEOs explained  IEOs take place on cryptocurrency exchanges. Having the initial listing on a trusted site lends a sense of validity to the new token, which may lead to people believing the exchange has vetted the project and ensured its legitimacy. But take this trust with a grain of salt. Binance Launchpad, for instance, publishes research reports on all new tokens listed for an IEO. Those reports, however, aren't critical of the projects they list; they simply explain how the projects work.  Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, claims that new coins on its launchpad go through “rigorous due diligence,” and CEO Changpeng Zhao said there is a “98% chance” that projects “won’t hear from us” after submitting applications. “In general, we like coins with a proven team, useful product and large user base,” he wrote in 2021.  IEOs are directly listed on the exchange, meaning that new projects have access to a large, highly liquid market. That allows the project selling the tokens to enjoy access to a rapt audience already interested in buying new tokens and enables the possibility for sales to be boosted by the marketing power of the exchange. In addition, some IEOs, like those on Binance Launchpad, let users buy new tokens with funds they already hold on the exchange, making it very easy for users to invest in new projects.  Yet IEOs aren't necessarily more secure than ICOs – at worst, they can be considered centralized gatekeepers about the types of projects that proliferate. Projects must also pay to get listed on a centralized exchange, meaning that only somewhat established projects can earn a spot. And they might have to sign exclusivity agreements that prevent them from listing tokens on rival exchanges.  IDOs  The drawbacks of IEOs – gatekeeping, opaque vetting processes and listing fees – have attracted some projects to initial DEX offerings. In IDOs, projects list their tokens directly on a decentralized exchange.  The benefit of an IDO is similar to that of an IEO. The main difference is the way the tokens are approved for listing. Instead of an exchange like Binance rifling through submissions, IDOs are approved by a decentralized exchange’s community. In a truly decentralized exchange, anyone can become an approver. (It should be noted that IDOs are specifically a fundraising mechanism; most DEXes list all coins without approval.)  Another benefit is that while some countries cannot access centralized launchpads – most forbid the sale of new tokens to U.S. residents – decentralized exchanges don't necessarily have know-your-customer (KYC) restrictions.  Polkastarter, for instance, doesn't “have any direct control or mandate over a project’s KYC requirements or process.” Instead, this is at the discretion of the project, which “may choose to restrict participants from certain countries because of a region’s crypto laws or status as a region at high risk of fraud.”  Again, there are drawbacks. Decentralized exchanges tend to be a lot smaller than centralized exchanges, meaning that the traffic that a new project receives might be substantially smaller than the traffic on an IDO.  The bottom line  Are IEOs or IDOs safer than ICOs? Not necessarily. The platforms’ vetting procedures, at best, allow new projects that they believe are a good fit for the platform. That doesn’t mean they make for a good investment or a better one than an ICO. Before investing in a new token, you should make sure to do your own research.

This remains an important technical level for the digital asset because it is right above its previous cycle peak.

He recommends selling bitcoin now. The reason is that after the Ethereum blockchain switches to a drastically less energy-intensive method of validating transactions, known as ""proof-of-stake,"" investors and regulators may realize that the energy-intensive method that both Bitcoin and Ethereum use now, called ""proof-of-work,"" was never really necessary.  Speaking on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program on Friday, McDonald cited the ""climate crisis"" and Bitcoin's massive use of energy. He said that because “Bitcoin doesn’t have the coordination like Ethereum to leave proof-of-work,” it could be “the first to be regulated away.”  Crypto’s energy consumption has become a major bone of contention for environmental activists and governments, and McDonald said bitcoin will never see ""$69,000 again."" The cryptocurrency traded close to that mark last November.  McDonald said the possibility of Ethereum cutting energy costs by 99.95% is “highly realistic.”  “When you’re moving from a system that is about generating as many random numbers as fast as possible with 10 million [graphic processing units] across the world, to a system that’s running on a few thousand computers that are pretty low energy, it’s going to make a huge difference,” McDonald said. Graphic processing units, or GPUs, are used in cryptocurrency mining.

To track Ethereum’s energy movement, McDonald created the Ethereum Emissions tracker, which takes a bottom-up approach, but doesn't factor in Ethereum’s price or the price of electricity, according to McDonald’s website.  “I’m starting with the hashrate, then looking at the hardware and making a technical argument for how much electricity must be used,” he said.  Read more: Ethereum After the Merge: What Comes Next?  NFT risk  One risk, however, relates to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), McDonald said. That is, “there’s a good chance some miners are going to switch to proof-of-work temporarily after the Merge happens.”  If the miners do in fact switch, there could be duplicates of NFTs for a short period of time on another chain, he said. If that were to happen, it could “potentially even dilute their values.”  But OpenSea, the world's largest NFT marketplace, said it would support only the proof-of-stake chain and added that it has been preparing for the transition in order to make sure the “process runs smoothly.”  Read more: Miner Chandler Guo Repeats Support for Ethereum Fork Post-Merge",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/09/02/bitcoins-price-may-crash-after-ethereums-merge-researcher-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/134b235985f6291f3a74c6fa83a790609f95bcc5-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411737,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfXhh,1662145239,"What Is MEV, aka Maximal Extractable Value?","Blockchain technology is the driving force behind cryptocurrency, allowing transactions to take place between parties without the need for an intermediary. Depending on the blockchain and the consensus method used, cryptocurrency transactions can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours to process.  In both proof-of-stake and proof-of-work consensus mechanisms, pending transactions are held in the network’s publicly visible waiting area called the ""mempool,"" where they will sit until a miner or validator selects them, orders them and creates a block out of the information. That block is then validated by nodes in a network and added to the official chain.  But as a pending transaction sits in a mempool, miners and validators have found ways to profit from them by including, excluding or reordering transactions in a block. This strategy involves maximal (formerly miner) extractable value, or MEV.  MEV is a relatively new phenomenon, and research and development groups like Flashbots are working to mitigate the risks associated with it. According to the Ethereum Foundation, some methods of MEV extraction are malicious and result in a worse experience for the user, while other methods can help fix network inefficiencies.  While MEV is most commonly associated with Ethereum, because that is the second-largest blockchain, it’s important to note that it’s not an Ethereum-specific issue. MEV strategies are less lucrative on Bitcoin, the largest blockchain, because of its lack of smart contracts — a primary opportunity for MEV-extraction on Ethereum and similar blockchains.  What is MEV?  MEV is sometimes referred to as an “invisible tax” that miners can collect from users – essentially, the maximum value a miner can extract from moving around transactions when producing a block on a blockchain network.  The activity was first predicted in 2014 by an algorithmic trader under the pseudonym Pmcgoohan, who warned that miners could quietly rearrange transactions in a mempool for personal gain.  “Miners can see all the contract code they run (obviously) and the order in which transactions run is up to individual miners,” the trader wrote in a thread on Reddit. “What is to stop front running by a miner in any marketplace implementation by Ethereum?”  Smart contract researcher Phil Daian and his colleagues expanded on this idea in a 2019 paper titled “Flash Boys 2.0,” coining the term “miner extractable value” (MEV) to refer “to the total amount of ETH miners can extract from manipulation of transactions within a given time frame.” The phenomenon gained popularity after researchers Dan Robinson and Georgios Konstantopoulos published a blog post in August 2020, describing Ethereum’s mempool as a “dark forest” because of the fierce competition and shadowy methods used to capture MEV.  At the time of writing, Flashbots estimates that over $674 million has been extracted from transaction reordering on Ethereum since the beginning of 2020, though some researchers suggest it may be a lot more than that.  How does extracting MEV work?  There are different ways MEV can be extracted from block production on a network like Ethereum.  MEV was first used in the context of proof-of-work, where miners control the order and inclusion of transactions in a block. Thus, the original abbreviation stood for “miner extractable value.”  The Ethereum blockchain in late 2022 underwent a shift to proof-of-stake (a move referred to as “The Merge”) and value extraction methods will continue after that transition, leading to the more inclusive term “maximal extractable value” that is commonly used today.  In theory, the Ethereum Foundation notes that network miners or validators should get the full MEV amount, because they are the only party that can guarantee a MEV extraction is successful. It notes, however, that a large portion of the MEV is retrieved by independent network participants called “searchers,” who run complex algorithms to detect profitable MEV opportunities and use bots to automate the process.  “Miners/validators do get a portion of the full MEV amount anyway because searchers are willing to pay high gas fees (which go to the miner/validator) in exchange for a higher likelihood of inclusion of their profitable transactions in a block,” the foundations explains.  Here are several examples of tactics used to extract MEV:  Front-running: Some searchers will use bots called “generalized front-runners” to scan the mempool for profitable transactions. Once a profitable opportunity is detected, the bot will replicate a user’s transaction with a higher gas price so that miners will choose that transaction over others.  Some groups are working to use this activity for good. Flashbots runs a service that allows Ethereum users and miners to communicate their preferred transaction order within a block. This is meant to be a “fair ecosystem for efficient MEV extraction” and has reduced the effectiveness of generalized front-runners, according to the Ethereum Foundation.  Sandwich attack: The term refers to a malicious type of front-running that is often used to manipulate cryptocurrency prices. It occurs when a searcher detects a large pending trade on a decentralized exchange (DEX) and places a trade right before and right after it to benefit from an artificial price change.  The sandwich attack will ultimately affect the amount of cryptocurrency the user who put in the initial transaction will receive, while the attacker will benefit from the price difference.  Here’s an example to illustrate: Let’s say you place an order to buy $1,000 worth of APE on a decentralized exchange like Uniswap. Your pending transaction then goes into the mempool.  Seeing that there’s an order to buy $APE, the MEV bot places two orders: one transaction that pays extra gas fees to buy $APE before your transaction, and another transaction to sell $APE after your transaction.  Transaction 1: MEV bot executes a buy order, pumping the token price.  Transaction 2: MEV victim buys the token at the higher price.  Transaction 3: MEV bot sells the token into the pool, benefitting from the price difference.  How high the MEV victim will end up paying depends on the “slippage” they’ve entered – the percentage price difference they’re willing to accept between the time of trade order and execution.  Dex arbitrage: Tokens will often have different prices on decentralized exchanges due to varying demand. When there’s a significant price difference across one exchange to another, MEV bots will buy lower-priced tokens to sell them on another exchange at a higher value. As a result, token prices across exchanges become more aligned, making the decentralized finance (DeFi) market more efficient.  This method is competitive but can be lucrative. In August 2020, a trader exploited a temporary difference between the price of stablecoins on several different decentralized exchanges, resulting in a net profit of $40,000:  Liquidation: DeFi lending protocols require users to deposit some cryptocurrency as collateral. When a user can’t repay his loans, the protocol typically allows anyone to liquidate the collateral and earn a liquidation fee from the borrower.  MEV searchers will compete to determine which borrowers can be liquidated and collect the liquidation fee for themselves.  Is MEV good or bad?  Using methods of MEV extraction like front-running and sandwich attacks can be harmful and result in network congestion and high gas prices for other users. But methods like DEX arbitrage can result in users getting the most fair prices across exchanges.  There are attempts to reduce the impact of malicious MEV, like Flashbots, and certain protocols search for the lowest prices for a trade across all exchanges and aggregators.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Ekin Genç,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-mev-aka-maximal-extractable-value,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/55dd7381d994e02adf1e3a874414f6d3c1eccfd4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s What The Different Price Models Say,"The bitcoin bear market has continued on recently as the crypto has failed to keep up any upwards momentum. How low can the price go before a bottom is in? Bitcoin Price Models Put Different Targets For The Cycle Bottom A recent post by CryptoQuant has discussed about the various pricing models for BTC and where they may suggest a potential bottom to be. Before looking at the data of these price models, it&apos;s best to first get a grasp of the major Bitcoin capitalization models. The normal market cap of the crypto is calculated by taking the sum of the entire circulating supply and multiplying it by the current BTC price. Another capitalization method is the &apos;realized cap.&apos; Where this model differs from the usual market cap is that instead of taking the latest value of BTC, it weights each coin in the circulation against the price at which that particular coin last moved, and then takes a sum for the whole supply. Next is the &apos;average cap,&apos; which simply gives us the mean market cap for the entire life of Bitcoin by summing the market cap for each trading day and dividing by the total age of the crypto (in days).

The hacker started to drain Murray’s personal wallet at around 7:00 p.m. ET on Thursday, according to on-chain data from Etherscan and details from Murray’s team. The unknown individual also attempted to take non-fungible tokens from the actor’s personal collection.  The high-profile hack showcases how even well-known celebrities can fall victim to crypto hackers and thieves. In Bill Murray’s case, though, the actor had the benefit of a wallet security team that protected him from the worst of the incident.  Murray’s wallet security team from NFT consultancy Project Venkman stepped in to shield the actor’s NFTs by moving his high-priced JPEGs – including a Damien Hirst NFT, two CryptoPunks, a Pudgy Penguin, a Cool Cat and numerous Flower Girls – to a pair of safehouse wallets.  The hacker also tried to steal 800 NFTs from the Bill Murray collection that were sitting in the wallet, though Project Venkman said it foiled that attempt by moving those NFTs to a safehouse, too. They said they ran a script to automatically move the NFTs to safety.  They were less successful with protecting the funds. A representative confirmed the hacker made off with 119.2 ETH Murray had raised just one day before for a charity auction. The attacker sent the stolen funds to a wallet address tied to the crypto exchange Binance and Unionchain.ai, according to Murray’s team. The culprit has yet to be identified.  Though the original ETH is gone, a runner-up in the auction, Coinbase user Mishap72, has sent 120 ETH (around $187,500) to Chive Charities to replace what was lost, a representative of the marketplace told CoinDesk.  Murray’s team says it’s filed a police report and is working with crypto analytics firm Chainalysis to bring the attacker to justice.

42373887,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvW9Z3,1662143918,House’s Stablecoin Bill May Face Fatal Delays for 2022 Progress,"One of Congress’ most serious efforts toward stablecoin oversight may have hit an insurmountable snag as negotiations in the House Financial Services Committee drag out further than the calendar is likely to allow.  A legislative push toward the crypto industry’s first significant set of U.S. regulations remains bogged down over negotiations between the panel’s Democratic chairwoman and its ranking Republican, despite initial plans that aimed to release a draft of the bill as early as this week, according to three people familiar with the talks. There have been a number of points to iron out, including such thorny topics as the role of state regulators, the possibility of a future digital dollar in the U.S. and the treatment of customer money held by crypto platforms.  While the negotiations are still going between Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the timeline is tightening for getting a bill through Congress. At this stage – as lawmakers devote more and more attention to the November midterms and as the legislative session winds to a close – the effort is unlikely to make it through this year, the people said. Though there had been some discussion of a bill being marked up – or revised in preparation for a committee vote – by mid-September, it may slip until much later in this session, or not at all.  However, because the same lawmakers are likely to win their races in November, the effort could be picked up and dusted off by the new Congress next year.  Spokespeople for Waters and McHenry didn't respond to requests for comment.  ""If it's true that the bill isn't moving to markup, we're glad committee leadership has decided not to move forward with what likely would have been a problematic proposal,” said Mark Hays, a policy analyst for Americans for Financial Reform, who advocates a “slower, more deliberate approach” and says there is already “a great deal regulators can do right now to address the risks posed by stablecoins to consumers and the market.”  The industry, however, has been calling for Congress to start establishing federal oversight over crypto. The absence of rules in stablecoins – digital tokens meant to maintain steady value by being tied to assets such as the U.S. dollar – was on wide display in May with the fatal plunge of terra-luna, which gave critical lawmakers something to focus on.  The Waters-McHenry bill had neared the finish line for a draft to be released weeks ago, before Congress’ summer break, but at least one last-minute request from the Treasury Department complicated the talks, a person familiar with that development had said. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen – concerned with so many crypto investors losing access to their money as firm after firm collapsed in recent months – had insisted that the legislation carry a provision to keep crypto customers’ money legally walled off from the assets of the companies they were dealing with.  When Waters announced in late July that an agreement was still out of reach and they would have to revisit the legislation after the recess, she had also said that she wanted the bill to direct the Federal Reserve to do more work toward a digital dollar – a controversial point. McHenry and other Republican lawmakers have asked for caution from the Fed on issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC), insisting that the central bank ensures it’s worthwhile and allows a leading role for the private sector.  The sides are also trying to hash out what authorities state regulators should have as federal rules are established.  Now, as Congress prepares to get rolling again after Labor Day, the stablecoin work is one of several efforts trying to make a mark on crypto.  “It’s critical that we continue moving the ball forward on this so we can have a regulatory framework that protects consumers, while allowing for responsible innovation,” Waters had said in her statement weeks ago.  But since then, lawmakers have made progress on other fronts, too. The Senate Agriculture Committee is expected to devote time this month to a more comprehensive crypto bill introduced last month by Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and the panel’s ranking Republican, Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.).",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/02/houses-stablecoin-bill-may-face-fatal-delays-for-2022-progress,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/24d8e623a494eb0e79fa9aa185391f7d10936feb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373897,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvW9ld,1662141777,"As 10,000 Long-Dormant Bitcoins Finally Trade, Observers Wonder What's Up","Unusual blockchain data appears to show large blocks of bitcoin worth more than $200 million moving for the first time in years, prompting crypto analysts to scratch their heads and agonize over what to make of it – if anything at all.  On Aug. 28, according to a post from crypto data analysis platform CryptoQuant, 5,000 BTC that hadn’t moved for at least seven years was transacted. The next day, LookIntoBitcoin’s data tracker showed another 5,000 BTC was transferred again.  Analysts say the transaction data isn't enough to draw any major conclusions and there’s no hard evidence about why the coins were moved. It’s possible that a long-term holder is looking to get out of the market, even with bitcoin prices at around $20,000, which is well off their all-time high of nearly $69,000. Or it might just be that the holder is simply making some administrative changes to the account status.  “It is definitely not a bullish sign,” CryptoQuant said. “It's hard to say what impact it will have.”  Antoine Le Calvez, lead blockchain data engineer at Coin Metrics, also noticed the transactions. He suggested the coins are somehow related to the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.  “From most likely to least likely, an old Kraken cold storage address, a Kraken OTC (over the counter) deal, a Kraken user,” he told CoinDesk in an email.  Kraken didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  It’s long been a bit of a spectator sport in crypto to watch long-dormant bitcoin move. In May 2020, the market was briefly rattled by speculation that Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto might be moving around a small batch of the cryptocurrency. Wallets tagged to Nakamoto – who has never been conclusively identified – are closely watched by crypto analysts. His hoard is so great that if it wee liquidated, the price of bitcoin would drop.  This isn’t the first time this year that large long-dormant BTC transactions have been spotted. The CryptoQuant post said more than 10,000 BTC was moved when the BTC price was at $47,700 in March, 2,800 BTC moved in May, and more than 1,100 BTC was moved at $23,000 per coin in July.  “The broader trend among addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC has been to increase their holdings over the past month, with their aggregate balance climbing by 35,000 BTC,” Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, told CoinDesk.  Bitcoin's price  Theoretically, keeping coins in different wallets might help investors manage their holdings more efficiently in times of high market volatility, and industry experts said it didn’t seem too unusual for wallets of this age to move.  ""We regularly see early bitcoin wallets like this becoming active,"" Kim Grauer, director of research at Chainalysis, told CoinDesk in an email.  It could also be that the bitcoin market has matured to the point where major macroeconomic developments, like Federal Reserve rate hikes, inflation reports or the August jobs report might have a greater impact on bitcoin's price than a pair of isolated and unexplained data points.  IntoTheBlock’s Outumuro said the bitcoin data might be “secondary in comparison to macro correlations near term, as there is less liquidity in the system.”  For what it’s worth, the recent coin transfers happened shortly after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank would likely maintain an aggressive campaign to tamp down soaring inflation – a stance that in turn might keep downward pressure on prices for risky assets, from stocks to cryptocurrencies.  BTC’s price dipped below $20,000 following Powell’s speech.

42421472,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoPpV,1662138346,TradFi Investors Will Love Ethereum’s Merge,"Unless you’ve been living under a crypto rock, you’ll know that Ethereum’s long awaited, much discussed transition from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake is poised to happen this month.  The Merge, as it’s known, is the most consequential alteration to a blockchain protocol in the history of cryptocurrencies. The question for investors is whether the market for Ethereum’s native token, ether, is pricing in this momentous shift.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  I argue that it is not, primarily because of the value that institutional investors will eventually find in “Ethereum 2.0.” (Note: my expectation for a higher ether price does not necessarily mean Ethereum 2.0 will perfectly adhere to the purest principles of decentralization. They are two different things.)  Before we go into that, let’s look at the factors behind ether’s price declines of the past couple of weeks, which removed a short-lived, Merge-driven premium. That should help us assess the bears’ case.  Factor #1: Doubt  Like the townsfolk in Aesop’s fable, “The Boy Who Cried Wolf,” investors in Ethereum have years of historical precedent to be doubtful that this thing can go ahead.  Even if the Merge does proceed, there’s a high prospect for glitches and failures in this exceedingly complex and inherently contentious shift. And if that happens, DappRadar has warned, there could be negative knock-on effects for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and other systems built on top of Ethereum.  But while we should respect the wisdom of the crowd, there’s one crowd whose opinions matter most: the vast Ethereum developer community, which has been kicking the tires on this project for years. And as Bankless founder David Hoffman noted in a rebuttal to a contribution on that media outlet’s service from Jordi Alexander this week, “the people who are experts on the details of the Merge are more bullish on its success than the [broad community of] people responding to [Twitter polls on the matter.]”  You could even argue that all the false starts give greater weight to the probability of success now. Developers are an obsessively cautious, risk-averse breed, which resulted in all the previous postponements in the proof-of-stake transition. That they’re moving ahead now suggests an extremely high degree of quality assurance has been carried out.  Factor #2: Regulatory risks  The U.S. Treasury Department’s move on Aug. 8 to sanction the mixing service Tornado Cash has caused great concern in the Ethereum community. Companies and foundations running Ethereum-based services quickly moved to block wallets with exposure to tokens that had passed through Tornado Cash.  The response has fueled concerns that corporate providers of staking pool services will also be under regulatory pressure to exclude tainted on-chain transactions in blocks, which implies an end to the vital principle of censorship-resistance.  These are real and important concerns. (Hence my earlier caveat distinguishing between prices and principles.) But restrictions on sanctions-tainted tokens could, counterintuitively, be a motivation for compliance-obsessed institutional investors to buy ether. And for the many who rightly need privacy in their transactions, the Treasury Department’s move is simply going to spur all manner of alternative solutions to bubble up.  Factor #3: Macro conditions  The main reason ether has fallen these past two weeks is exogenous to Ethereum. It’s because Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that interest rate hikes will go on longer than people had hoped. That led investors to dump all “risk assets,” a category to which crypto currently belongs in their minds.  But if you’re looking for a story around ether decoupling from other assets dragged down by macro factors, then The Merge offers you one.  That story starts with traditional finance (TradFi) institutions. Those are the guys whose “risk-off” instincts in the face of tighter monetary policy led them to dump digital assets and exacerbate the current crypto winter. They’re the same guys who will help lead us into spring.  We know that despite the moribund state of markets, many hedge funds, family offices, venture funds and even pension funds and endowments are looking seriously at the long-term benefits of including crypto in their portfolios. Below I lay out why post-Merge ether could figure prominently in their future allocations.  The institutional case  ESG compliance: Look, as I’ve frequently stated, I think the anti-Bitcoin spin among many environmentalists wildly misses the opportunities for promoters of renewable energy to partner with miners to fund and build demand-response solutions that help make grids greener. But the reality is that until those solutions become ubiquitous, Bitcoin’s proof-of-work system will continue to produce a massive carbon footprint, making it a pariah among entities looking to meet environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards. Major institutions will be constrained from investing in bitcoin by their internal investment committees and, soon, by regulations coming from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ethereum’s shift to a massively less energy-intensive proof-of-stake mechanism will make ether, by comparison, much more attractive.  Staking as “fixed” income. Proof-of-stake systems allow holders of the token to passively and predictably earn additional tokens by participating in blockchain validation. Although the dollar value of ether will continue to swing, that income model looks a lot like the fixed-income patterns of bonds, an asset class on which institutions are steeped. With sophisticated DeFi hedging and stablecoin solutions coming, institutions will likely avail themselves of some unique new financial instruments that bring reliable returns to their portfolios. The staking boom is coming.  Scarcity function. According to the current Ethereum 2.0 specifications, the Merge comes with a significant, multi-year phased reduction in the rate of new ether issuance. This will make ether comparatively scarcer than it was and, by extension, underpin its market value. Institutions are going to like the long-term outlook in that.  Positive narrative. There’s a can-do aspect to all this that can’t be overstated. It is truly impressive that a hurly-burly, disparate community of open-source developers could pull this off while a blockchain supporting around $200 billion in total value continued to operate. It’s a grossly underappreciated example of humanity’s capacity for innovation and collaboration. That’s a positive story (assuming the Merge goes ahead as planned) that will boost confidence in Ethereum and, by extension, attract new and old investors.  Might the bears prove me wrong? Of course. And, as I said, the bull case I articulated comes with challenges to decentralization and a validation of wrongheaded ESG reasons to support proof-of-stake over proof-of-work. But, no, I don’t think the Merge is priced in.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Michael J.

According to a document filed Thursday by Kirkland & Ellis, the law firm Celsius has hired to help it restructure, Celsius expects “approximately $70 million of proceeds from the repayment of USD denominated loans.”  During a hearing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York on Thursday, a Kirkland & Ellis lawyer said the loans were mistakenly believed to be in dollar-pegged stablecoins, which the lender wouldn't have been able to use to finance its operations.  The extra money means a much-needed boost to Celsius’ scarce liquidity and will extend its runway to pay its business and restructuring costs as it seeks to find a more durable solution to its cash crunch problem. The firm’s costs far exceed its proceeds from its unprofitable bitcoin mining operation.  Celsius expects to receive the majority of the repayment by Oct. 7. The forecast shows that its disposable cash balance will stand at $42 million by the end of November. Extrapolating its weekly net cash flow, the cash pile will barely last through the end of this year.  The company initially forecasted – without accounting for the loan repayments – that it would run out of cash by October. It later revised its forecast to say it would probably survive till the end of the year, citing $61 million in loans maturing. The document that contains the latest cash-flow forecast declared a slightly greater figure than that, $70 million.  The troubled lender found itself in the middle of a recent insolvency crisis in the crypto industry. The firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July and later revealed it was $2.8 billion short of crypto holdings that it owed to its customers.

Watching his allies abandon him. And hearing the lamentations of his shareholders.  Call me the world’s happiest cynic, then, because when I predicted the utter and catastrophic failure of Facebook’s rebranding as “Meta” starting less than a year ago, I genuinely didn’t think it would all unravel as quickly and ignominiously as it has. Horizon Worlds, Meta’s intended metaverse, went live in December and, my god, it has been downhill from there.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The good news is that we’re getting a lot of free entertainment out of Mark Zuckerberg’s attempts to be “the face” of this dead-end transition, and the past few weeks have seen some real highlights, culminating with a transcendently embarrassing appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast last week. Zuck and his marketing team are still seemingly in thrall to the Meta CEO’s former status as a Silicon Valley wunderkind, evidently blinding them to his nearly supernatural lack of personal appeal.  See also: What Facebook's Patents Tell Us About the Fight for the Soul of the Metaverse | Opinion  The results are frequently, in a word, delicious for a hater like me. And while the sizzle comes in the form of incredible public relations embarrassments, after that comes the steak: Facebook’s pivot to Meta is crashing and burning as a material business proposition with astonishing rapidity.  The past few weeks have been particularly brutal for Zuckerberg’s grand ambition to create a Second Life mod in which everyone is a double amputee. The current (far from first) wave of embarrassing flubs kicked off on August 17 when Zuckerberg posted a “selfie” from Meta’s Horizon World’s rollout in France. As pretty much everyone was happy to point out, it looked embarrassingly bad – not just like a game built to roughly 2007 levels of detail and immersion, but like one without the slightest spark of design creativity.  Uncreative, passive, pointless  This lack of creative juice can’t be overemphasized. There are genuine technological limits to the graphical fidelity and avatar-tracking that’s possible in an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment, but Horizon Worlds could have done a lot better within those limits. Compare its aggressively bland corporate vibe to the spectacularly colorful Minecraft-inspired voxels of The Sandbox (which has an alpha season open right now, FYI).  That comes down substantially to business models. Blockchain-backed metaverse projects like Sandbox and Decentraland are gratifyingly weird and quirky in part because they’re fairly chaotic organizations answering to a lot of stakeholders. But Zuckerberg has effectively total control of Meta, and the emptiness inside of him is written across every pixel of his creation.  Zuckerberg followed up with an even less-realistic simulation, when he last week appeared on an episode of the “Joe Rogan Experience” as an uncanny mimic of Rogan’s martial-arts loving, red-meat fanbase. Bloomberg’s Max Chafkin has a definitive read on this one, but in a nutshell Zuckerberg made the case that virtual reality will make you more of an ass-kicking alpha, compared to the “beta” passivity of watching television.  This is hilarious for at least three reasons. First, sitting inside staring at screens will never make you more vigorous – for god’s sake, touch grass. Second, Zuckerberg himself has already spread more hormone-sapping passivity in the world than maybe any other single person via Facebook and Instagram. And third, on a personal level, it’s hard to think of a less-convincing pitchman than the eternally affectless-to-miserable Zuck for any supposed shortcut to leading a more fulfilling human life.  A real business?  But this is all just theater and window dressing, however gobsmackingly inane. The real question is how Meta’s Reality Labs is doing as a business. And the answer is … surprisingly, maybe, better than you think! But still pretty rotten once you scratch the surface.  You see, it turns out that Meta actually sold a whole lot of its Oculus Quest 2 headsets over the 2021 holiday season, with app installs suggesting about 2 million new units activated over a two-week period. For comparison, a little over 20 million total Playstation 5 consoles and 15 million Xbox Series X units have sold in the past two years.  But that comparison itself is a problem for Zuckerberg’s real goals: If the Quest or successor units are successful as video game consoles, they’re probably still a failure. You see, the units are almost certainly being sold at a big loss. This more or less affirms that the long-term business model is the same kind of data harvesting and ad monetization that Facebook and Instagram run on.  That means Zuckerberg doesn’t actually want you using the headset for playing Superhot VR, he wants you in Horizon Worlds specifically, having the kind of data-rich social interactions that he can use to spy on your tastes, habits and network, then nudge you into clicking on advertisements.  See also: Reflecting on Facebook's Hilarious, Well-Deserved Crypto | Opinion  The problem is that Horizon Worlds is not just unimpressive graphically, but functionally clunky and basically pointless. Most crucially, there’s seemingly no equivalent to the stream of posts and updates that keep people coming back to the actually-successful Facebook and Instagram products.  Broken simulation  To be crystal clear, Horizon Worlds’ morally execrable agenda, which essentially amounts to commercialized mind control verging on psychological abuse, is the main reason it’s so fun to watch Zuckerberg flounder. This is a man who has harmed society, so celebrating his not-so-slow downfall is a completely guilt-free pleasure.  But it’s even more delightful that serious business observers seem to believe he’s going to completely flub even this manipulative agenda.  Equity markets utterly loathe Facebook’s pivot to the metaverse, and every word about it coming out of Zuckerberg’s mouth. Over the past six months – that is, even after its epic 26% one-day crash in February – Meta’s stock has underperformed both every other major tech stock except Netflix, and the overall market. Meta is down 21% for that span, versus a 4% drop for Apple (AAPL), a 15% drop for Amazon (AMZN), a 10% drop for the Dow Jones industrials and a 14% drop for the Nasdaq composite index.  There are endless reasons for this, but one in particular deserves highlighting. As Kotaku’s reviewer observed, Horizon Worlds is currently packed with hall monitor-like “community guides” keeping watch on what’s going on. From a business perspective, that might be the scariest signal of all, highlighting the risk that Horizon Worlds will be even harder to moderate for offensive or dangerous content and behaviors than Facebook already is. If the “community guides” are a permanent necessity, as 15,000 content moderators still are at Facebook, the whole thing may yet prove fundamentally economically non-viable.  See also: Facebook Steals Another Crypto Idea | Opinion  Then there’s the ultimate sign of imminent doom – the June departure of former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. Sandberg has always been the “adult in the room” at Facebook/Meta, the person who knew how to turn a mind-destroying Skinner Box into a profitable business. (Which is, yes, an embarrassing reality given that Zuckerberg is now nearly 40.) Sandberg’s departure signals a deep lack of faith by probably the single living human who knows the most about what’s actually going on over there.

42411086,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC0CR,1662136518,Designer Drug Markets Get Boost From Crypto,"Conversations on drug forums can get nerdy. People looking to push the barriers of their mental and bodily experience tend to know a lot about the vagaries of the law, organic chemistry, metaphysics and, increasingly, the ins and outs of blockchain technology. For many, the first step towards opening the doors of perception is managing a bitcoin (BTC) key.  Technology and drugs have always been intertwined. Marijuana was the first thing ever sold over the ARPANET, an early version of the internet, in a cross-country deal between graduate students. Magic mushrooms were the first thing listed and sold on the Silk Road, a shuttered anonymous marketplace that was proving ground for commercial use of Tor and Bitcoin.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Sin Week.  And now, crypto is serving as a bedrock tool for an emerging world of novel drugs, the interaction of which is fundamentally reshaping the recreational drug industry. Research chemicals, aka designer drugs, are new synthetic substances sold primarily online that exist in a legal gray area.  These are chemical cousins to familiar, illicit substances like LSD, ecstasy and meth that, through a few chemical tweaks as well as ambiguities in global regulations, can be sold and advertised with almost total impunity. They have names like 2C-B, AMT and 5-MeO-DMT, and hundreds of variations are synthesized annually.  “The internet has allowed for easy access to drugs, weapons and other criminal activity through the dark web as well as other criminal organizations who make their living off the backs of those unsuspecting young people looking to score any number of drugs,” James Capra, the retired chief of global operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), told CoinDesk.  That’s only the half of it. While darknet markets remain a popular place to score, the research drug industry thrives on the “clearnet,” or the part of the web you can explore with a Google search. This has enabled people who otherwise would not have access to recreational drugs to discover them.  Roy Gerona, a drug monitoring specialist at the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, said “the explosion” of research chemicals can be attributed to three concurrent and interrelated trends: the democratization of information over the internet, easy shipping through globalization and the adoption of digital payments – including credit cards and crypto.  “The market has evolved so rapidly,” Gerona, who was one of the first to model novel synthetic cannabinoids, said in an interview from a book-lined office. The internet has allowed for an entirely new type of market to emerge, creating a platform for demand to surface and for suppliers to meet it.  There are dedicated forums, like Erowid and on Reddit, where psychonauts (those who experiment with the new pharmacopeia) act as guinea pigs to study the effects of these never-before-seen chemicals and post about their experiences. They titrate doses and write trip reports, breaking down their experiences by the minute or hour.  The internet is a flat communications platform, allowing people from all corners to interact and share information. An illegal industry that was already difficult to police became infinitely more so now that the chain of distribution and knowledge has fragmented and dispersed online. Permissionless blockchain networks, a step change in empowering individuals through software, further complicates law enforcement.  See also: Inside a Manhattan Web3 Sex Club | Sin Week  “For the first time, you had an online payment mechanism that cannot stop you from using your own money,” Nicolas Christin, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies online marketplaces including the Silk Road, said about the beginnings of bitcoin.  Market size  “More brazen than anything else by light years” is how U.S. Senator Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) characterized the Silk Road, the Tor-based marketplace founded by Ross Ulbricht, before it was shut down by the FBI in 2013.  In less than three years, some 3,877 vendors sold approximately $183 million worth of various goods and services to 146,946 users on the Silk Road. That information, a government estimate, is available because the marketplace only used bitcoin. Bitcoin was once thought to be fully anonymous, but turned out to be only pseudo-anonymous, where alpha-numeric addresses can be traced back to real identities with a little legwork.  “As law enforcement agencies get better at shutting them down, the necessary trust for such large marketplaces to function has eroded leading the way to exit scams and a general sense of wariness within the darknet market ecosystem,” Carles Lopez-Penalver, a senior cybercrime analyst at blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, said.  For years, authorities believed the next phase of the war on drugs would involve shining lights on darknet marketplaces. After the Silk Road shut down, Silk Road 2.0 emerged, which was shuttered a year later. Copycats were easy to spin up because the original marketplace’s code was open source.  Hydra, the longest-running dark web marketplace before closing this year, took its name from this phenomenon – if you cut off one head of the mythological Hydra, two new heads grew in its place. While darknet markets are still being founded, much of the drug industry has begun to shift into public view.  “The darknet market ecosystem has changed dramatically over the past decade,” Lopez-Penalver said. The industry has moved, in part, instead to “single-vendor” shops including Next Generation and Heineken Express. Telegram and Wick, encrypted messaging platforms, allow dealers to spin up groups or interact with clients directly.  OpenBazaar, another darknet marketplace, which aimed to go mainstream, closed due to a lack of volume. Christin, who studied the marketplace, called it a “ghost town” with interesting technology that deployed decentralized file storage network IPFS, privacy-preserving cryptocurrency Zcash and Tor. Part of this issue is OpenBazaar, to appease investors, disabled drug queries in its search bar.  Part of the research chemical industry’s growth is due to its ability to operate in open view. Exact figures for the size of the industry are not available, due, in part, to its semi-clandestine nature, global spread and constantly changing bevy of available substances. In 2013, the United Nations’ World Drugs Report found 90% of countries surveyed attributed synthetic drugs a “significant” market share.  See also: Can Crypto Save the Cannabis Industry? | Sin Week  When asked how Chainalysis might treat cryptocurrency transactions involving research chemicals, Lopez-Penalver said categorization is tricky. “Some research chemicals/designer drugs may be ‘legal’ in one country; however, they may be controlled substances in another country.”  By and large, the most popular sites for designer drugs are hosted in Eastern Europe. Actual drug synthesization is done in “loosely regulated” facilities in China and India, experts have said. Increasingly, manufacturers are operating in Canada, one retailer who asked not to be identified said.  Loopholes  Governments have been slow to respond to the wave of research chemicals, which can pose serious risks for users. Manufacturers play a cat-and-mouse game with law enforcement, tweaking scheduled substances to avoid prohibition and drug testing. Because these are literally novel substances, often the effects are unknown before a drug forum guinea pig tries them.  Although entire classes of drugs have been made illegal in varying jurisdictions – such as how fentanyl and its analogues (fentalogues), synthetic opioids that can be thousands of times as potent as heroin, were banned outright in the U.S. – that is not always possible or advisable for other chemical structures that may have medicinal or other uses.  It comes down to “risk assessment,” Gerona said. The U.S. “blanket-banned” fentalogues due to their potency, wagering any potential benefits of later studying them did not square with their contributing negative effects on the ongoing opioid epidemic.  “For others, we know there are legitimate uses for synthetic cannabinoids for pain relief. Some stimulants and psychedelics can also have therapeutic effects,” Gerona said. Banning research chemicals completely would essentially be a ban on chemistry.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime records under 300 banned substances globally. Because laws are typically based on specific chemical formulas, these variants, created by tacking on or snipping off groups of atoms, are legal until they are broken down in government laboratories and explicitly banned.  “While new harmful substances have been emerging with unfailing regularity on the drug scene, the international drug control system is floundering, for the first time, under the speed and creativity of the phenomenon,” the U.N. wrote.  Technically speaking, the U.S. does have a law on the books that outlaws whole ranges of chemicals that mimic illegal drugs. Other nations have similar laws and have also banned import/export of certain precursors needed to synthesize various illicit substances. But it’s a patchwork system, and hundreds of novel chemical structures continue to slip through loopholes in the law.  ""The darknet market ecosystem has changed dramatically over the past decade,” Chainalysis' Lopez-Penalver said.  Jerry Martin, founder of MicroDelics, a research chemical retailer based in “beautiful” Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, said his wares are unregulated and for research purposes. Sometimes simply sticking a “not for human consumption” sticker on packages makes all the difference.  Martin did say some of his customers, typically people interested in microdosing trace amounts of psychoactive drugs, prefer transacting in crypto even if what they’re buying is not illegal. “A lot of customers want to make their purchases discreetly,” he said.  This was echoed by Gerona, who investigates drug forums to stay up-to-date on the market. “The main attractive feature of that community is the non-traceability of the transaction,” he said.  Tammy Jarbeau, a representative of the Public Health Agency of Canada, sent CoinDesk a series of documents spelling out Canadian regulation of pharmaceutical drugs for human use, of drug analogs and controls on chemicals and precursors, which together allow authorities to trace financial flows as part of criminal investigations.  But as it stands, the Canadian government is not necessarily tracking cryptocurrency transactions to drug retailers or manufacturers.  “I have reached out to many departments, and from the Canada Border Services Agency there are currently no reporting requirements under the Cross-border Currency and Monetary Instrument Reporting Regulations (CCMIRR) and the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) related to virtual or crypto currencies,” Jarbeau said via email.  “Most marketplaces are now cognizant of the fact that bitcoin is not a panacea, and instead recommend that people use privacy coins. We've seen dash also, to a lesser extent, and monero seems to be more prominent than it used to be,” Christin said.  Information spreads  The most hardcore research chemical users often see their experiments as ways to improve their lives and possibly better humanity. Many of the chemicals currently sold today were first synthesized or theorized by professional biochemist Alexander Shulgin, whose books “TIHKAL” and “PIHKAL,” short for Phenethylamines and Tryptamines “I Have Known and Loved,” have become touchstones for the community. In both, Shulgin describes routes of manufacturing as well as his and his wife and friends’ subjective experiences with various substances.  The complicated chemistry he wrote about was once privileged information, which began to spread on the Usenet message boards in the early days of the web. Self-described psychonauts have taken up his tradition of experimentation. For them, drug use is a personal choice that should not be intermediated by governments.  Shulgin, who died in 2014 and is credited with inventing MDMA, argued that drug prohibition has the opposite effect to the one intended and argued for decriminalization. Although he didn't live to see the rise of the internet or the mass sale of some of the many compounds he first created, his prediction was likely correct.  See also: Criminal Crypto Use Is Growing, but That’s Just Half the Story | Sin Week  Gerona said prohibition is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it limits legitimate use and research into potentially helpful chemicals. On the other hand, it likely prevents death, addiction and other societal harms. He did say that the thousands of posts on message boards about recreational use of novel drugs has “legitimate” scientific value.  James Capra, of the DEA, said it’s not uncommon for drugs to be “counterfeit” and “deadly” when bought online. Christin said you should assume you’re talking to someone in law enforcement when using a darknet service.  Research chemicals are similar to crypto in at least one way – it’s an industry that seems to have hit escape velocity. Neither seems to be slowing down soon, and the more individuals who join the truer that is.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/09/02/designer-drug-markets-get-boost-from-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d074050a104e8662d2e4b34b47d12a152f81e07c-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373892,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvW9fL,1662133541,Automated NFT Market Maker Sudoswap to Release Its Governance Token via Airdrop,"Decentralized non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Sudoswap is releasing its new governance token via an airdrop to community members, according to a blog post published Thursday.  The Ethereum-based SUDO token’s initial supply of 60 million will be distributed mostly to holders of XMON, the native token behind the 0xmon NFT collection, created by the founders of Sudoswap. XMON holders will participate in a lockup to collectively receive 41.9% of the total SUDO supply. During the three-month lockup, XMON holders can receive 10,000 SUDO per XMON token locked.  The price of XMON has jumped 38% in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko,.  The blog post also specified that 1.5% of the SUDO supply will be distributed to holders of 0xmon NFTs, while a retroactive liquidity provider airdrop will allocate 1.5% of the supply to Sudoswap liquidity providers.  The remaining 55.1% of tokens will be allocated across the treasury, founding team members and SudoRandom labs, the primary contributor to the Sudoswap protocol.

42373904,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvW9uR,1662128608,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Inches Up After Report Shows Slowing US Jobs Growth,"Price Point: Bitcoin was rising Friday after the U.S. Labor Department reported that jobs growth slowed dramatically last month, which is seen as a boost for the prices of risky assets, because it relieves pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates aggressively.  Market Moves: A look at how derivatives are dominating ether markets ahead of the Ethereum blockchain's Merge.  Chart of the Day: U.S. inflation-adjusted bond yield is at its highest since mid-July.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) was back trading just above $20,000 Friday, after dipping to $19,500 during the week as stock markets in Europe opened in the black after a negative week.  The largest cryptocurrency got an extra boost from a U.S. government report showing that the world's largest economy added 315,000 jobs in August – a slowdown from the 526,000 reported for July, but still above economists' estimates for a gain of 300,000. The data might prompt traders to dial back their expectations for interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve, which is generally a positive for the prices of risky assets like cryptocurrencies.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up 2% on the day. It has gained 6% over the last seven days. The network’s Merge, which is a major software update, is now less than two weeks away.  In the altcoin market, Lido DAO, a liquid staking tool for Ethereum, was up 8%. The platform has almost $7 billion in total value locked and a market capitalization of $1.2 billion. Polygon’s MATIC was up 7%.  In the news, Reuters reported Thursday that in late 2020, U.S. federal prosecutors asked crypto exchange Binance to submit internal documents related to its money-laundering checks and communication involving CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao.  Futures exchange FTX.US Derivatives said Thursday that Jill Sommers, a former commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,has joined its board in a move to help bolster the firm’s regulatory efforts. The hire comes as FTX has previously pitched the CFTC to directly clear customers' crypto swaps.  The International Monetary Fund has called for a global platform for cross-border payments, and reiterated calls to regulate a crypto sector that officials say is unstable, inefficient and riddled with fraud.  Cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.comhas backed out of a five-year sponsorship deal worth $495 million with the UEFA Champions League, Europe's elite soccer league, according to a report in SportBusiness.  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Chainlink LINK +7.8% Computing Polygon MATIC +5.6% Smart Contract Platform Polkadot DOT +5.3% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Terra LUNA −8.9% Smart Contract Platform  Market Moves  Ether Derivatives Markets Continue to Heat Up Ahead of the Merge  As the much anticipated Merge gets closer, data from Kaiko, a provider of crypto data, shows that ether derivative markets are heating up.  New money is returning to the perpetual futures markets more ferociously than ever, specifically for ETH, with open interest recently breaking all-time highs and an increase in volume in ETH perpetual futures as investors on either side of the debate look to position themselves ahead of the Merge.  The share of perpetual futures volume between bitcoin and ether had ETH commanding 45% of volume at the start of August and going up to 57% at the end of August as this month's Merge approaches, according to Kaiko.  Spot vs. perpetual futures volume  An increasing number of ETH perpetual futures trades are being made compared with spot market trades and are beginning to have an outsized influence on sentiment surrounding ether, according to Kaiko.  According to Kaiko's report, volume typically correlates to price movements, and if futures markets are seeing a greater increase in volume than spot markets, the correlation might signal that the futures market is leading price discovery.  ""Back when markets were at all-time highs last November, perps only did 4x the volumes of spot markets,"" the report stated.  ""Now at 7x the volumes and with open interest at all-time highs, it seems investors and institutions are turning to perpetual futures to place their bets on ETH, which as we’ve seen over the last month have been predominantly biased to the short side.""  Based on the ETH perpetual future daily volume over the last year, there is an increase from $19 billion to over $33 billion. Daily spot volumes rose to $4.8 billion from $3.7 billion in just over a year.  Chart of the Day  U.S. Inflation-Adjusted Bond Yield at Highest Since Mid-July  By Omkar Godbole  The inflation-adjusted 10-year U.S. bond yield has jumped to 0.67%, which is its highest level since July 11, according to data sourced from charting platform TradingView.  Like gold, bitcoin tends to move in the opposite direction of the real yield.  Bitcoin's 90-day inverse correlation with the real yield reached a record -0.95 in July and remained elevated at press time.

42411081,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBzvu,1662126374,Why Crypto Winter Hasn’t Dulled the Passion for Web3 Sex Work,"PolyAnnie worked hard as an erotic NFT artist and adult content creator for two and a half years. Last year, she spent the whole summer traveling and teaching other adult content creators about non-fungible tokens, but she became burnt out and has been on hiatus for at least six months.  Something changed in the crypto industry when she came back. She found herself out of the loop. Projects she had dedicated time and energy to were inactive, and some were dead.  This feature is part of CoinDesk's Sin Week.  PolyAnnie was one of the content creators on Datingverse, a metaverse for mingling. The platform introduced a “dating-to-earn” tool to the world of crypto, enabling fans to develop connections with “content producers” while earning tokens ($DVC).  PolyAnnie started working on Datingverse in its early days, hoping to direct it to be the best version of a badly needed adults-only space in Web3. There was going to be ownable land, NFTs and a bustling community.  “The idea they presented to me was a platform to explore diverse and unconventional sexual expressions,” she said. In other words, a place for the types of misfits who find crypto attractive. She intended to eventually share personal, erotic photos on the site – one of her many streams of income.  But nothing panned out. There were lots of promises and little delivery, she said of the site that still advertises her as one of its “first 50 creators.” The project seems to have been abandoned.  ""I checked their Discord, and there's been no activity for over two months,"" she said. For many adult content creators who are getting into crypto, these projects are an alternative and possibly more reliable way to earn income.  This situation is far from uncommon in the Web3 world now. After experiencing skyrocketing growth during the crypto bull run last year, many players are down and out, or mothballed. Once reliable ways for creators to earn income have dried up. But many still believe crypto offers a better alternative to the traditional adult entertainment industry and advocate for its adoption.  Run-ups to roadblocks  In June of last year, Elon Musk tweeted a series of emojis that appeared to refer to CumRocket, an adult-themed cryptocurrency. No one was sure if it was a joke or if Musk was even referring to the project, but nonetheless, the price of CumRocket rose to 28 cents from 7 cents. Suddenly, sex work crypto projects seemed like a viable model – at least as promising as the billionaire’s other crypto fascination, dogecoin.  ""Everyone and their mother made a porn token last year,"" Ben Fraden, chief business officer of Vicewrld DAO, a Web3 adult entertainment organization, said. He said he was aware of around 80 porn tokens, some of which, such as TABOO, had market caps of more than $400 million.  Read More: The Sex Club, Tokenized  The money rushing into the sector was a huge incentive for some adult content creators. By selling NFTs, PolyAnnie finally felt that for the first time she was an artist, getting paid fairly for her work.  “I had to hustle my ass off to get people to give me $10 a month [on OnlyFans]. ​​But I sold a painting [as an NFT] for $5,000. There were months where I would do $10,000, which was crazy for me, because I'm not used to making more than $20,000 a whole year,” she said.  After the run-up, many project founders exited the market when they realized sex work was more than a fantasy and they would have to do more than sell a token to make their business viable. The biggest project remaining on Fraden’s radar, called TABOO, is worth just $16 million now, down 96% from its peak of $400 million.  ""There’s probably 15 or less out of 80 [projects that] still have active communities one way or another,"" Fraden said.  Many things can kill a crypto project. Its founders could depart, its token could collapse or its community could lose interest. That’s all true and then some for erotic projects, which carry their own particular risks.  Crypto’s adult creators also feel the crypto winter.  PolyAnnie's first five months' income from selling adult NFTs was twice as much as her previous year's earnings. That’s not the case for Web3 sex workers this year. Liv X Jem, a Canada-based adult content creator and Web3 obsessive, also recently switched to creating for traditional web platforms after experimenting with Web3.  ""I have a family to support, so I'm trying to bring in as much income as possible. I have moved back to OnlyFans as well,"" she said, referring to the private “camming” platform.  Pain or pleasure  According to IBISWorld, a U.S.-based industry research publisher, the online adult and pornographic industry in the U.S. in 2022 is worth $1.1 billion. The adult industry in Web3 is still far from competing to any meaningful degree with traditional adult entertainment companies.  Often, the crypto industry erects its own roadblocks. Tim, CEO of the Pleasure Network, an adult social platform, got a “no” when he reached out to MoonPay, a cryptocurrency exchange, when looking to list his project’s token.  ""Our native token cannot get listed on centralized exchanges because they don't allow adult projects, and they are working with Mastercard and Visa,"" said Tim, who requested that his surname be withheld.  This was even after he took steps to sanitize the project, which was initially called xxxNifty and focused on selling NFTs. PolyAnnie worked as a brand ambassador and NFT manager on xxxNifty, where she also sold lots of her erotic NFTs. One of the reasons it made the change is because the name carried a “negative stigma.”  Read More: The Truth About Crypto and Sex Work  ""Anything with XXX or porn in front of it, or super adult-related things makes it extremely difficult to do business in the United States and even many places in Europe,"" Dan Leal, aka “Porno Dan” of the Pleasure Network, said.  Pleasure Network had trouble opening bank accounts, getting lawyers to take it on as a client and paying its bills. It also felt it was having trouble drawing an audience on social media.  Despite Pleasure Network’s payment issues, its founders have expanded the scope of the project and are now developing the “​​world’s first adult metaverse,” a token-gated platform that promises a safer environment for adult models.  Tim and Leal are far from the first people to believe that crypto can right the wrongs of adult entertainment. The industry is known for its exploitation of workers and a web model that has meant most revenue accrues to centralized companies like Pornhub, rather than content creators.  Many projects have set out to build something like Pleasure Network’s $NSFW token, pitched as a standard way to pay for porn, which on the day of this writing saw only $12,131 in trading volume. Many have failed or exist only on the margins. But many will continue to try to bring sex work into Web3, because it seems so compatable.  ""The adult content industry is the most legitimate thing I can think of for crypto,"" Fraden said.  Financial issues  In 2020, Visa and Mastercard stopped allowing their cards to be used on the world’s largest porn site Pornhub. Recently, those two credit card giants suspended card payments for advertising on Pornhub and its parent company MindGeek.  Under the pressure of being kicked off mainstream payments platforms, the adult entertainment website moved to accept only cryptocurrency payments in 2020. It now accepts direct deposits and paper checks, but similar financial risks have caused other adult businesses to also adopt crypto as a failsafe.  Some crypto projects were founded as dedicated solutions to deal with this long-existing problem. Back in 2019, for instance, Spankchain launched a crypto payments platform called SpankPay that allows users to pay with ""privacy coins"" zcash (ZEC) and monero (XMR) and a few other cryptos.  In addition to being censorship-resistant, crypto’s basic design structure naturally addresses the significant financial woes for adult enterprises: chargebacks and piracy. The chargeback rate is well-known for being unusually high in the adult content industry, likely in the double digits, Fraden said. Customers can easily make a call to their credit card companies to get their money back after watching porn they buy online.  Read more: How to Pay for Porn With Crypt  That is less of an issue for porn creators using blockchain technology, which by design makes transactions irreversible. You can't have chargebacks in crypto. And for a similar reason, piracy becomes harder.  ""It was so easy to rip off content that was produced by people like myself, and they just uploaded it randomly,"" Leal said.  Blockchain prevents piracy in a number of ways, although all digital media (even stuff appended to a blockchain) can still be copy and pasted. There are token-gated entertainment platforms, and the ability to monetize original works using NFTs, which reduces the sting of counterfeits.  The pseudo-anonymity of crypto is also useful for people who can’t have or would prefer not to have porn-related transactions tied to their financial identities.  ""People don't like 'Sexy Fox 69 OnlyFans' showing up in their bank account,” Fraden said. “Buying ethereum or something looks nicer.”  Still exploring  The recent crypto bubble brought in believers and speculators alike into the Web3 sex industry. What survives now that it has popped, mainly believers, will be stronger, some say.  Jordanna Foxx, a British porn star, created her Web3 project, called Vicewrld, in September 2021 amid the height of crypto mania before bitcoin started to deflate. It has generated about $27,000 so far since its NFT marketplace launched in February.  Although it hasn’t yet pulled in the revenue she was expecting, Foxx said she continues to work hard on it, she said. For her, it’s not just about the money – but the chance to better conditions for sex workers.  The project has given her the ability to test her mettle as a front-end developer and experiment with increasingly complex technologies, she said. Vicewrld, for instance, recently merged with Adult DAO, a Web3 adult production company and community Fraden belongs to, to form the Vicewrld DAO.  Foxx thinks crypto can help adult performers expand their “shelf life,” or the amount of time that producers think they are young or new enough to the industry to attract attention.  To Foxx's mind, the metaverse expands a porn star’s options because it allows them to be whoever they want – young, old or penguin.  ""There isn't a shelf life and your avatar is forever young,” she said. “The metaverse elongates somebody's career, so they don't have to kind of then be ashamed of who they are.”  The metaverse is expanding the options for sex work, including for jobs that are removed from the stage. Inspired by Foxx, Liv X Jem, previously an adult performer, has taken up front-end development after joining the Vicewrld DAO team as an operation manager, and she has started to learn how to code.  ""I just finished Python. I know how to write smart contracts, and I've built a generator for my own NFT project,"" she said.  For PolyAnnie, Web3 isn’t just an alternative way to earn income but also a place to explore solutions to censorship, income inequality and individual data ownership. PolyAnnie is exploring moving away from platforms like OnlyFans that would increase her vulnerability.  She said she might explore building her own Web3-enabled website, which could link with other creator’s sites and begin to build a community.  ""I'm exploring a more autonomous and sovereign way of doing things,” she said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Xinyi Luo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/09/02/why-crypto-winter-hasnt-dulled-the-passion-for-web3-sex-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/06176383247d00c182982881fe02d576826caf63-3157x2368.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The research project, which began this month, involves the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Center (DFCRC), made up of 25 prominent institutions. The goal of the project is to explore the economic impact of a CBDC's use-cases in the country and how digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC) should be regulated.  “Now we have banks [that] are coming out being incredibly bullish about decentralization,” Bacina said.

Bacina noted that crypto was not part of the agenda for the new Labor Party (ALB) government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese unlike the pro-crypto stance of the previous government of the Liberal Party’s Scott Morrison.

The firm was said to have been eyeing the loan book business of Celsius, according to people familiar with the matter.  Voyager filed for protection from creditors in June after pausing customer withdrawals as it faced a liquidity crisis triggered by the collapse of Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Celsius followed suit, citing “extreme market conditions.” Another lender, BlockFi, was hit hard by the sharp downturn in the crypto market in June and July, trimming roughly a fifth of its workforce and accepting a $250 million loan from crypto exchange FTX in moves that sparked concerns about its financial health.  “We want to offer an option for distressed lending companies that may not be able to come out of bankruptcy due to regulatory issues,” BnkToTheFuture CEO Simon Dixon told CoinDesk in a statement.  BnkToTheFuture is registered as an excluded securities business with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority. Salt, founded in 2016 and based in Denver, was one of the first entrants to the crypto lending arena, predating companies such Celsius and BlockFi.  ""By combining a registered securities business with a registered lending business, we believe we are able to offer a regulatory-compliant lending and yield platform to users,"" a company representative told CoinDesk.  The company worked with crypto exchange Bitfinex on a recovery plan. In 2016, Bitfinex was hacked for more than119,756 bitcoins, or $66 million at the time, in 2016, after attackers managed to bypass account security controls.  Bitfinex recovered in less than a year after working with BnkToTheFuture, Dixon said. That plan involved enabling the redemption of Bitfinex’s BFX tokens for equity in iFinex, its British Virgin Islands-based parent company, to customers affected by the hack.  The deal with Salt Lending is contingent upon signing definitive agreements and obtaining regulatory approvals.

42373899,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvW9o9,1662122781,US Job Growth Slowed in August; Bitcoin Gains,"The U.S. added a robust 315,000 jobs in August, slightly more than expected but still revealing a slowdown in hiring amid rising interest rates and slowing economic growth.  Bitcoin (BTC) gained 0.8% in the minutes after the report was released. The weaker growth gives the Federal Reserve cover to refrain from more aggressive interest rate hikes at the U.S. central bank's next monetary policy meeting in September, relieving downward pressure on risky assets from stocks to cryptocurrencies.  “Obviously we’re looking at how the Fed may or may not change their reaction function based off of this number,” said Path Trading Partners chief market strategist Bob Iaccino on CoinDesk TV. With the CME FedWatch Tool now showing a 64% chance of a 75 basis point rate hike at the next meeting, “it’s a little easier for markets and for crypto,” he said.  Economists had forecast 300,000 added positions. But it's a stark decrease from the 528,000 jobs added by the U.S. economy in July.  The fresh data released by the Labor Department on Friday showed that hiring – a rebound after 22 million jobs lost during the coronavirus pandemic – is still strong but is slowly coming down; it might be a sign that changes in monetary policy by the Fed are starting to have an effect.  The unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose to 3.7% from 3.5%, indicating that large-scale layoffs by big companies are starting to weigh on workers. Wages increased 0.3% from the previous month.  Bitcoin was slightly up after the report. Traders anticipate the data could give the Federal Reserve green light in their aggressive fight to tame inflation by raising interest rates and making borrowing money significantly more expensive.  August’s Employment Situation report might be one of the most important data points this year because it is one of the last big economic reports considered before the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) next meeting on Sept. 21-22.

42373902,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvW9tB,1662119830,Did Ethereum Merge Optimism Lift Ether or Was It the S&P 500?,"Ether (ETH), the native token of Ethereum's blockchain, rallied sharply in the four weeks to mid-August., doubling to $2,000.  Most analysts attributed the price rally to the long-awaited Ethereum Merge – the technological upgrade that will transform the smart contract platform to a proof-of-stake network. The switch is expected to cause a drastic reduction in ETH supply, and thus hoped to bring a store of value appeal to the cryptocurrency.  And they may be right, as the rally began mid-July after Ethereum developer Tim Beiko hinted at Sept. 19 as the deadline for the Merge.  Read more: The Ethereum Merge Has an Official Kick-Off Date  However, a closer look at the price action over the past two months suggests the risk reset in traditional equity markets probably paved the way for ETH's bull move. Looking ahead, that sensitively to stock markets warrants caution on the part of ether bulls expecting a more significant rally after the Merge, which is now likely to happen around Sept. 15.  Over the past two months, ETH has moved in lockstep with Wall Street's benchmark stock index, the S&P 500.  Ether's 90-day correlation with the S&P 500 strengthened from 0.70 to 0.90 in the past four weeks, and the 30-day correlation is a strong one as well. While correlation doesn't always imply causation, the U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike hopes/fears appear to be driving the positive relationship in this case.  Possibly behind the equity rally in July and the first half of August was the hope that inflation has peaked and the Federal Reserve would resort to rate cuts next year. That dovish Fed narrative, however, fizzled out in the second half last month, bringing renewed weakness in stocks and cryptocurrencies, with ether tumbling more than 20% from a peak hit on Aug. 14.  The move suggests evidence of Merge optimism failing to shelter the cryptocurrency from macro jitters and stock market decline.  Post-merge rally to remain elusive?  While the demand-supply factors seem to favor an ether price rise after the Merge, the cryptocurrency's recent failure to stay resilient in the face of stock market weakness calls for caution on the part of the bulls. The expected rally may remain elusive or could be muted if the macro jitters and traditional market risk aversion worsens.  Per several industry experts, including trading giant Cumberland and Arca Director of Research Katie Talati, the real Merge rally in ether has yet to happen and will likely begin only after the upgrade takes out a significant chunk of selling pressure from the market.  ""Assuming the ETH [proof-of-work] fork does not lead to a robust new market, it is safe to assume that this $40 million of daily [ether] selling will disappear once the PoS chain is established,"" said Cumberland in a Merge-focused report published in August. ""With the demand persisting, and the supply decreased due to the Merge, we would expect upward price pressure to resume.""  ""This should ultimately look very similar to the halving of the miner rewards, which have typically been followed by bullish price action,"" Cumberland added.

Georgia's national currency, the lari (GEL), was priced at $290 rather than $2.90 on Wednesday.

Some users who were able to take advantage reported that their bank accounts and debit cards were frozen by their banks after transferring their funds to them, which Coinbase said was not at its behest.  Coinbase said the issue was exploited by 0.001% of its total users, or about 1,000 customers.

42373918,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWEwR,1662114115,Derivative Volumes of Ether Surpass Bitcoin Ahead of Merge; Here's Why,"Volumes of derivatives tracking ether (ETH) have grown by nearly 10% in the past month and now lead those of bitcoin (BTC), according to a report from Kaiko, citing data sourced from multiple crypto exchanges.  Out of the total addressable market of ether and bitcoin futures, ether now commands 57% compared to 45% on Aug. 1. Open interest – or the number of unsettled futures contracts – has ballooned to over $8.43 billion this week from under $4 billion in July, data shows. This suggests that in the past few weeks ether prices have been pushed upwards due to the high use of leverage.  Futures data from the past 24 hours shows ether futures crossed over $35 billion in total volume compared to $32 billion on bitcoin futures, which usually see the highest volumes.  The interest in ether futures likely arises from traders positioning themselves ahead of Ethereum’s Merge scheduled for later this month – a catalyst that has changed market dynamics for ether and caused price fluctuations.  Read more: What Is the Ethereum Merge?  Funding rates data suggests a significant part of that open interest could be from short trades, or positions that bet against price rises. Funding rates are periodic payments made by traders based on the difference between prices in the futures and spot markets.  Depending on their open positions, traders will either pay or receive funding, and the payments ensure there are always participants on both sides of the trade.  As per Kaiko analyst Conor Ryder, such short trades are growing in popularity as investors are either betting on an unsuccessful or delayed transition to proof of stake, or hedging their long spot ether positions ahead of The Merge. The latter reason is increasingly becoming a favored bet among investors, Ryder said, as some anticipate the possibility of an Ethereum fork and an eventual airdrop of a new ETHPOW token.  “A strategy also doing the rounds involving short ETH futures has been to go long spot ETH, short futures and leave yourself eligible for any ETHPOW airdrop,” Ryder wrote. “Think of this as a dividend strategy, eliminating any price risk by going long spot, short futures, but collecting a potential dividend in ETHPOW.”  Future markets for ETHPOW have pegged prices of the potential token at $18, or just 1.5% of ether’s current value, as reported.  The Merge shifts Ethereum from a proof-of-work mechanism to a proof-of-stake design, after which the network will rely on “stakers” to process transactions instead of miners. This would theoretically increase network speed and security, while considerably reducing the power requirements needed to run the current Ethereum blockchain.  Read more: The Ethereum Merge Has an Official Kick-Off Date  The event is additionally expected to slow the rate at which ether is issued – particularly in the months immediately following the switch. As issuance slows, the blockchain’s token-burning mechanism will continue removing ether from circulation at the same rate as before the Merge.  Over time, this could decrease ether’s total market supply and eventually cause an increase in prices with increasing demand. However, some traders remain skeptical about the medium-term price performance of ether.  Ether trades at just under $1,600 at writing time and has risen 3% in the past 24 hours, data shows.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | AIRDROP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/02/derivative-volumes-of-ether-surpass-bitcoin-ahead-of-merge-heres-why,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b1a4149418cacd71aac6480d900fb6eb68839123-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373915,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWEsf,1662105293,"Bitcoin, Ether Consolidate as Traders Eye US Jobs Report to Gauge Next Fed Rate Hike","It's nonfarm payrolls (NFP) Friday and prominent cryptocurrencies are trading in established ranges ahead of the critical U.S. jobs data that may help determine the scale of the impending Federal Reserve rate hike.  Once largely ignored by the crypto market, the report has gained prominence this year as it reveals the state of the labor market and wage growth in the world's largest economy and helps the Fed determine the amount of liquidity tightening – or how much money to withdraw from the economy – needed to cool inflation.  The tighter the labor market, the stickier inflation and the more pro-tightening, or hawkish, the Fed will be. Risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, are addicted to cheap liquidity and have taken a beating this year, mainly because of the Fed's interest rate hike cycle. This year, the central bank has raised rates by 225 basis points. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.)  The figure for August, scheduled for release on Friday at 12:30 UTC (8:30 a.m. ET), could help determine whether the Fed will deliver a third 75 basis point increase later this month or opt for a smaller 50 basis point move. According to Reuters, the economy probably added 300,000 jobs last month following July's 528,000 additions and the unemployment rate held steady at 3.5%. Average weekly earnings likely rose 5.3% year on year following July's 5.2% rise.  ""Instead of looking to the broader rate path, or the terminal rate, markets are back to trading the Sept. 21 FOMC odds – whether they will hike 50 bps or 75 bps,"" Crypto Fund QCP Capital said in a market update published on Telegram early this week, referring to the Federal Open Markets Committee, which sets the interest rate.  QCP said markets are already pricing a 90% probability of a 75 bps hike, which seems like a high degree of certainty given that NFP and inflation figures for August are yet to be released. A ""sizable miss"" in the jobs data could see traders pare back bets.  A lower probability of a 75 bps hike will most likely hurt the dollar and lift cryptocurrencies. According to data tracked by ING, the long (buy) dollar is now the most crowded trade. So, a weak report could trigger a knee-jerk drop in the greenback. Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) tend to move in the opposite direction to the dollar.  ""We are in a bit of a weird situation where bad news = good news for the market. If we see surprise downside in NFP, it’s possible rates won’t be lifted as high/fast, lifting speculative assets such as BTC higher,"" Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds, said.  While an interest-rate increase of 50 basis points still represents monetary tightening, markets battered by rampant inflation and back-to-back 75 bps jumps could find solace in the prospect of a smaller move.  According to analysts at ING, the case for a 50 bps rate hike would strengthen if NFP prints at 250,000 or higher, while the odds would swing in favor of a 75 bps move if the data comes in above 350,000.  ""Should the economy add substantially more jobs, say 350k+, and the wage number posts a second consecutive 0.5% month-on-month increase, or higher, then it could swing the argument in favor of 75b bps,"" ING analysts wrote in a market update published on Aug. 26.  Bitcoin traded near $20,000 at press time, extending a five-day consolidation between $19,500 and $20,600. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, traded little changed below $1,600, according to CoinDesk data.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/02/bitcoin-ether-consolidate-as-traders-eye-us-jobs-report-to-gauge-next-fed-rate-hike,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0fe53d26c67f6bf228424125d045a5b4d2dde3cd-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The fatal drop in EOS prices bounces back from the support trendline sustaining above the 50-day SMA. Currently, the morning star pattern forming at the trendline shows a bullish follow-through candle teasing a price jump above the psychological mark of $1.50. So, will this trend sustain in these volatile market conditions to reach the $2 mark? Key Points: The EOS prices jump by 11% from the support trendline. The RSI slope resurfaces above the halfway line. With a market cap of $1.51 Billion, the intraday trading volume of EOS has increased by 81.22% to reach $546 Million.

However, the bund control at the support trendline with the morning star pattern. The bullish reversal accounts for a price jump of 11 % over the last two days and reclaims the psychological mark of $1.50. Hence, the improving market condition increases the possibility of an uptrend continuation. If the EOS sustains above the psychological mark of $1.50, an uptrend to $2.0 is possible if the buyers overtake $1.75. Conversely, a downfall below the support trendline will result in an increased supply pressure dropping the market price to $1.20.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin's Wrestling Match With $20K Continues  By James Rubin  Bitcoin's tango with $20,000 continued on Thursday.  The largest cryptocurrency by market value danced below the psychologically important threshold but then rebounded for the sixth straight day.  BTC was recently trading at about $20,100, roughly flat over the past 24 hours and near the middle of the tight range it's occupied for a week. Bitcoin plunged late last week amid mounting fears over continuing U.S. central bank monetary hawkishness and macroeconomic uncertainty.  The asset seems increasingly likely to remain in the same price rut until the release later this month of the latest inflation numbers and other key economic indicators, and the Federal Reserve's next interest rate hike, which is widely expected to be 75 basis points.  ""I think we're definitely in a market purgatory for some time until some big things start to happen around the regulatory front,"" Greg Johnson, co-founder and CEO of Rubicon Crypto, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. He added: ""I'm paying attention of course, like everybody else in the industry to what happens in September.""  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands just below $1,600, up about a 1.5% from a day ago. Johnson was upbeat about the Merge, the Ethereum blockchain shift later this month from a proof-of-work to more energy efficient proof-of-stake protocol that has excited investors.  ""We look at the Merge as one of the most important experiments in the blockchain community that's ever happened,"" he said. ""The success lays the blueprint for other migration [from proof-of-work] to proof-of-stake. That's going to have an impact on market performance short term. Really, the big thing is what does this do to set in motion broader, similar moves across the blockchain space?  Other cryptos in the CoinDesk top 20 by market cap spent much of Thursday in the green, with COSMOS and LINK recently climbing more than 7% and 4%, respectively. Popular meme coins DOGE and SHIB were also up.  Stocks  Equity markets were mixed, with the tech-focused Nasdaq falling slightly but the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) breaking four-day losing streaks to close up 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively. Investors will be nervously eyeing the U.S. Department of Labor's latest jobs report on Friday for signs of a cooling job market more consistent with a contracting economy. The current jobless rate stands at an historically low 3.5%, although a report Wednesday by payment processor ADP showing private employers adding a lower number of jobs to their payrolls than the average of the previous three months suggested some weakening in the jobs market.  Crypto news  Beleaguered crypto lending platform Celsius Network's troubles continued on Thursday as a group of custodial-account holders formally asked the court overseeing the company's bankruptcy case to authorize the return of their funds.  Other industry and crypto market news was brighter. As CoinDesk's Krisztian Sandor reported, some analysts believe the current bitcoin swoon offers a good opportunity to put on a contrarian bet on the digital asset's price rising. And CoinDesk's Jocelyn Yang found that even as the crypto market pointed downward in August, the prices of several altcoins rose because of positive news events affecting them.  Rubicon's Johnson believes the crypto market will expand considerably at least in the U.S. only after regulatory efforts by leading government agencies progress.  ""We believe that for big things to happen in the crypto markets, for us to go from being stuck at 16%, 17% 18% U.S. adoption, we're going to need everybody to get on board, and over the next year or so I think you're going to start to see more and more of that start to take place. That's when we start to see the network scale that everybody talks about.""  Johnson added: ""There's over $100 trillion easily in the registered advisory industry in the United States. If just a small amount of that starts to migrate, the entire crypto ecosystem moves and it moves exponentially.""

Numbers play a part of it, but not the entirety.  The cryptocurrency industry is full of big, brash personalities. Given the increased prominence of the asset class, law enforcement is paying closer attention.  Binance is the subject of a probe by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (though it’s unclear if this is a subpoena or just a conversation). The IRS has also promised to make more of an effort to go after traders that underreport income. MicroStrategy founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor finds himself being scrutinized by the District of Columbia’s Attorney General over his tax residency. Saylor says he’s a resident of Florida, where he claims he resides for over half the year, votes and reports for jury duty, but the case being brought by the District says he’s also a resident of D.C.  “Under District law, any individual is subject to District tax liability if they are domiciled in the District, or if they establish statutory residency in the District. Saylor has been domiciled in the District, or a statutory resident of the District, or both, in each year from 2013 through 2020,” the complaint reads.  The complaint outlines that under D.C. law a person can be a statutory resident if they maintain a place of abode in the district. It also outlines that from 2013-2020 Saylor sometimes spent less than three months in Florida – and always returning to Washington, D.C. This round trip, they say, proves that his real home is in the District and not in Florida.  “He continued returning to Georgetown, where his yachts were docked, time and again. Furthermore, social media posts confirm that the District remained the center of both his social and business lives. His District abode served as a home accessible to his principal place of business in Tysons Corner, showing that his economic base of operations remained near the District, not Florida,” the complaint reads.  Complaint  The complaint also says that despite registering to vote in Florida, Saylor has never actually voted in person in the state, according to voter records.  “Voting records show that he requested absentee ballots sent to the address of MicroStrategy’s corporate office in the District suburbs in the 2020 election, and, on information and belief, he requested that absentee ballots in prior elections be sent to either his corporate address in Virginia or home address in the District,” the complaint says.  Saylor, for his part, disputes the charges, saying that he always remained in Florida for the majority of the year.  But the problem is the case isn’t about that. It’s about where he made a home.  Every tax jurisdiction in the world accounts for this, otherwise the rich would shuttle themselves between low-tax jurisdictions and their ""home base"" and avoid paying tax. Washington, D.C., even has a special clause for this: Part-Year D.C. Resident. The item accounts for those that spend part of their year in the District, even if they don’t have a statutory residence.  One defense Saylor might have is to highlight the seemingly political nature of the prosecution. Saylor, brash personality and all, is a staunch libertarian (though he tends to donate across party lines), and cryptocurrency along with bitcoin maximalism tends to be a favorite whipping boy of the political left. The Attorney General, on the other hand, is fairly open about his disdain for the political right.  While the D.C. AG’s office does present a strong case against Saylor, it could have undoubtedly gone after lower-profile targets that don’t have lightning bolts in their Twitter profile picture.
