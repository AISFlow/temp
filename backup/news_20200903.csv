He also failed to report roughly $1 million in income that he received in exchange for his promotion of BitClub.  “Abel operated as a large-scale promoter of the BitClub Network,” according to a press release from the District of New Jersey U.S. Attorney’s Office. The scheme took money from investors in exchange for shares in the scheme and rewarded its investors for recruiting new participants.  BitClub highlights how widespread investor enthusiasm over bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be co-opted by fraudulent actors.

Campos Neto also was reported to have said that CBDCs are the consequence of fast-digitizing financial systems such as Brazil's. Banco Central is rolling out its PIX instant payments system in November and launching an Open Banking initiative later this year.

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $10,726 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 6.1% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $10,468-$11,474  BTC below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bearish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin continues its downward trend Thursday, with prices descending as low as $10,468 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase. While it has recovered a bit, traders selling for profits has certainly been the theme right now.      Read More: Bitcoin Plunges $403 in 1 Hour to Lowest in a Month      “This is similar to what we’ve seen as bitcoin approached the $10,000 and $11,000 levels, where profit-taking occurred on a few different occasions,” said John Kramer, a trader at crypto over-the-counter firm GSR. “Many investors will see this as an opportunity to buy the dip.”      Just like Wednesday, leveraged liquidations played a role in exacerbating bitcoin’s price drop. However, Thursday’s wipeout of long traders on derivatives exchange BitMEX was a bit higher, with $10 million in hourly liquidations topping Wednesday’s $9 million hourly spree, the equivalent of a margin call in crypto parlance.

Thomas suspects bitcoin’s price will not reach new 2020 highs in the near term, despite testing that level as recently as Tuesday when the price hit $12,085. “I think we trade in the $11,000-$12,000 range for a while,” he said.      In equities, while the major Asian Nikkei 225 index was buoyed by expectations new leadership in Japan will continue economic stimulus policies put in place by outgoing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, stocks in Europe and particularly in the U.S. are awash in red – as it is in most of the crypto ecosystem Thursday.    Asia’s Nikkei 225 ended the day in Tokyo climbing 0.94%, boosted by gains in the chemical and metals sectors.  Europe’s FTSE 100 slipped 1.5% as concerns about further job losses on the continent soured investor sentiment.  The United States’ S&P 500 dropped 4.1% as tech stocks took a tumble, including Apple falling 7.2% and Microsoft down 6.7%.    GSR’s Kramer views the equities markets with some trepidation, and has concerns about the performance of traditional finance for the balance of 2020. “Stock valuations remain overinflated in the eyes of many observers, and economic uncertainty persists,” he said. “A crypto drop like this won’t deter the majority of investors who have a longer-term investment thesis.”      Read More: Jump Trading Invests in Decentralized Exchange Serum    Ether dominance dominates    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was down Thursday, trading around $402 and slipping 7.6% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

Raytheon BBN Technologies won a $495,039 contract titled: ""Characterizing the applicability and relevance of DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) in Air C2"" (CARDIAC) from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL).  The contract's title indicates that Raytheon's advanced tech researchers will consider how DLT can benefit commanders' ability to keep their eyes on the skies and their pilots safe and lethal. That's the gist of C2, Pentagon shorthand for Command and Control.  Other than the title, the parties, the funding and the date, the CARDIAC viewed by CoinDesk Thursday had little to reveal. Raytheon BBN did not immediately respond to a request for comment and neither did AFRL.  But Lt. Col. Neil Barnas, who has studied blockchain's military potential, told CoinDesk DLT could be an asset for the USAF's C2. He said distributing otherwise centralized C2 systems makes them less vulnerable to enemy attack.  ""If you have the one command and control system to rule them all you’ve really just created a target,"" he said, speaking to CoinDesk in a personal capacity.  The USAF has made clear this year that it is preparing to spend millions of dollars on modernizing C2. ""Highly advanced and lethal tools"" help airmen ""to prevail in the high-end fight,"" officers wrote in their FY2021 budget overview.

Under the Stacks Open Internet Foundation's beta grant program, projects will get between $1,000 and $5,000 to support their visions for Stacks blockchain tools, initiatives, evangelism and development.  Funding these relatively small-dollar projects will help grow Stacks' community and facilitate its mission of supporting a user-owned internet, said Brittany Laughlin, the nonprofit's chief.  For now, the foundation said it will dole out its grants in dollar form in lieu of stacks tokens (STX). That's a notable break from the crypto space's now commonplace practice of fostering development with grants in their target project's native token.  Stacks plans to switch over to STX payouts just as soon as the blockchain upgrade called Stacks 2.0 goes live, Laughlin said.  Her foundation has no shortage of the token. Last month Blockstack PBC turned 100 million STX tokens (worth $21.5 million at press time) over to Stacks, along with intellectual property rights to certain patented Blockstack technologies.  Laughlin said Stacks will pour most of its token fortune into ""grants and ecosystem development.""  ""At least 30 million STX are dedicated to fund application development, as they were set aside for App Mining's next evolution, which will likely be awarded in the form of app development grants,"" she said.

42404999,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKLcW,1599155377,Wasabi Wallet Patches Flaw That Could Have Thwarted Bitcoin Privacy Feature,"Wasabi Wallet users need to upgrade to the latest version if they want to continue using the CoinJoin feature to keep their Bitcoin transaction histories private.      That’s because those running older iterations of the wallet can no longer use this feature to mix their coins with users who have the newest version.      The Wasabi Wallet team hard-forked the wallet Thursday to address a vulnerability discovered by a team member at Trezor, a leading maker of hardware wallets. A hard fork is a code change that makes older versions of a software incompatible with newer ones.      The flaw’s discovery is another example of the open-source community's camaraderie and cooperation. Developers are constantly tinkering to improve their peers’ software, and many vulnerabilities have been responsibly disclosed during these processes to patch flaws before they can be exploited by bad actors. (Sometimes, however, the disclosures by rival teams are less-than-cordial, as evidenced by the long-running tensions between Wasabi and rival Samourai Wallet.)      Read more: Hardware Wallet Flaw Lets Attackers Hold Crypto for Ransom Without Touching Device      According to a Wasabi Wallet blog post, Trezor hardware wallet developer Ondřej Vejpustek responsibly disclosed the potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack to the Wasabi team on May 10 (a DoS attack entails an attacker spamming a network or protocol with the hopes of stymying its operations, hence “denial of service”).      “Vejpustek has been very cooperative since the beginning and left us total freedom on how to manage the disclosure, both in terms of time and communication. This demonstrates the importance of proper communication between security researchers and dev teams. This is how a responsible disclosure should be,” Wasabi Wallet contributor and marketing strategist Riccardo Masutti told CoinDesk, adding that Vejpustek was paid a bitcoin bounty for his efforts.      This hypothetical DoS attack, which Wasabi Wallet assumes has never been carried out, would have interfered with the wallet’s implementation of CoinJoin, a privacy protocol that allows users to mix their bitcoin with others’ to obscure the coins’ transaction histories.      Wasabi Wallet’s CoinJoin implementation requires each participant to take out as much as they put in. If, for instance, 10 participants join a mix for 0.1 BTC, then each user must send exactly that amount (plus a miner fee) and must receive that exact amount for the mix to be successful and to retain CoinJoin’s privacy protections. Mixing coins makes it harder for blockchain snoops and nosy parkers to pin bitcoin transactions to known addresses and their owners' identities.      Read more: Wasabi Wallet Is Revamping Its CoinJoin Design to Allow Bitcoin Mixing With Differing Values      The disclosed DoS vulnerability would have halted the mixing process. The attacker would register bitcoin for a mix without that bitcoin being signed (verified) by the mix’s coordinator, while at the same time submitting a real, verified transaction to the mix.      The result would be an incongruity between the total value of inputs made to the CoinJoin and the value of expected outputs. As a result, the coordinator would unwittingly “build a transaction that can't be valid, since the sum of all inputs is less than the sum of all outputs,” according to Vejpustek's analysis.      If the attack were pulled off, it would foil the CoinJoin, though it would not have given the attacker the ability to steal any coins nor could they deanonymize any peers in the mix.      Wasabi Wallet patched the fix with the hard fork deployed Thursday.

42405008,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKLnL,1599153771,3 Reasons Bitcoin Just Tanked Below $11K for First Time in a Month,"Bitcoin prices tumbled 6.2% Thursday, falling below $11,000 for the first time in a month.      The price drop trimmed the largest cryptocurrency's 2020 rally to 50% and sent digital-asset market traders and analysts scrambling to explain the sell-off.      Here are three reasons cited by analysts:    1. Bitcoin slid in sync with traditional markets    The Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks retreated Thursday after climbing to a new record high earlier in the week. A report showing new U.S. jobless claims at 881,000 in the final week of August was better than feared – and the lowest since the pandemic hit earlier this year – but still well above the 665,000 level that marked the high point of the last recession in early 2009. Pantheon Macroeconomics called the figure ""still grim,"" while Navy Federal Credit Union economist Robert Frick said the labor market was ""continuing to struggle, and not showing improvement despite COVID-19 levels that declined in August.      John Todaro, director of institutional research at the cryptocurrency analysis firm TradeBlock, said:      ""There could be an overlap between equity sellers and digital currency sellers. The largest equity market decliners this morning are tech stocks, including retail trading darlings, Tesla and the FAANG names [Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet, once Google]. It is unclear if this will push into a continued broader crash in equity markets, which could put more pressure on digital currencies, or if it is just a short-term correction.""    2. Bitcoin got pulled down because of DeFi unwinding    Traders have been getting out of the recent speculative fervor in decentralized finance, or DeFi, much of which takes place on Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain. Prices for ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, tumbled 8.3% on Thursday after a 7.6% drop the prior day. Yet those price drops followed gains of 54% in July and 25% in August amid reports of eye-popping dollar amounts flowing into DeFi – especially with recently-launched projects like Compound, Yearn.Finance and SushiSwap – attracting attention from traders to the fast-growing and lucrative-but-risky pursuit of ""yield farming."" Total value locked in DeFi more than doubled in August to $9.5 billion, but in the past few days the amount has shrunk to $9.1 billion, according to the website DeFi Pulse.      Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the crypto prime broker BeQuant, told CoinDesk in an email: ""The explosive growth that decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and all things DeFi has finally reached levels that begin to impact on the sentiment across its centralized exchange (CEX) counterparts, with the sell-off triggered by a combination of stratospheric Ethereum fees. Also, an aggressive unwind of the very crowded trade across Uniswap token related positions in the wake of a number of tokens, namely PIZZA and HOTDOG, dramatically collapsed from $6,000 to $1 in a mere few hours. This is likely because the same assets (bitcoin, ether and others) are used aggressively to structure collateralized positions. Similarly to another DeFi heartthrob SushiSwap, these offerings were also Uniswap clones. DEX and DeFi trading is no longer a hobbyist activity and a number of firms that dominated CEX space have recently ventured out into DeFi to generate alpha. As such the Chinese wall that once separated markets is no longer in place and sentiment from one market will flow into another, and vice versa.""    3. Miners sold some of their bitcoin    Bitcoin miners and possibly traders decided to take risk off the table by trading in some of their cryptocurrency, which they receive as rewards for helping to maintain the security of the blockchain network. CoinDesk reported prior to Thursday's sell-off that blockchain data were showing elevated transfers of bitcoin to exchange wallets, typically seen as a precursor of heightened selling pressure. According to CryptoQuant, a blockchain-data analysis firm, tracking of major bitcoin-mining pools showed an increase in bitcoin being transferred out – ostensibly also to exchanges for a possible sale.      Ki Young Yu, founder of CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat: ""Miners are good traders. I think they are just looking for selling opportunities, not capitulation. I think it's going to be the war of miners between those who want a bitcoin price rally and those who don't.

42404992,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKLVd,1599153344,"Russia's Latest Draft Bill Would Still Largely Ban Crypto, Stifle Miners","The Russian Ministry of Finance has drawn up a new draft bill that echoes a previous attempt to outlaw cryptocurrency use and, if passed, would have a major impact on the nation's crypto miners.      The document, sent by the ministry to other government branches for feedback, states that miners located in Russia and using Russia-based infrastructure may not be rewarded for their work in cryptocurrency, according to the Russian newspaper Izvestia, which first reported the bill.      The draft is intended to amend a new law on digital assets signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin at the end of July.    Blow for miners    If the bill becomes a law, it might push individual miners outside of lawful operations, says Igor Runets, CEO of BitRiver, one of the largest mining farms in Russia. ""They receive crypto as a reward [for recording transactions on the blockchain], and this becomes illegal,"" Runets said.      A way around this issue would be for a miner or mining farm to establish a foreign entity through which to conduct its finances, Runets suggested. However, the process isn't cheap, and wouldn't be an option for small miners that can't afford the legal costs.      Read more: Russia’s Crypto Mining Farms Would Have to Report to Government Under Proposed Bill      The draft bill, obtained by CoinDesk (see below), states that the ""actions allowing third parties to use digital currency, creation of software and hardware for issuance of the digital currency and transactions with it in the computer systems created by the foreign laws,"" are ""not forbidden."" However, accepting digital assets as a payment for such work would be outlawed.      The new rules could affect facilities in Russia that host clients' mining devices and get paid in cryptocurrency for the electricity and services they provide.      According to Jakhon Khabilov, head of the Sigmapool mining pool, currently only smaller mining farms in Russia accept crypto as payment, while larger ones are paid in fiat currency via bank transfers.    Prison threat    The bill includes stipulations from a previous draft, introduced into the Russian parliament but abandoned after a public outcry. Both state that Russian citizens can only possess crypto assets if they inherit them, receive them as debtors of a bankrupt company or receive them as compensation after winning a lawsuit.      Read more: Russia Is Blocking Bitcoin-Related Websites Again      The new draft also carries over the proposal that illegal issuance and usage of cryptocurrency, and accepting it as a means of payment, should be punished with fines of up to 1 million Russian rubles (about $13,240) or up to seven years in prison.      These measures were introduced in May but met strong criticism from the Russian crypto community as well as from the country's Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Economic Development.

Blockchain technology would provide the GVC Passport a distributed, trusted, real-time source for global regulators to verify business’ accreditation claims, according to the Saudis' accompanying white paper.  The result: a more efficient financial system with firms – especially small and midsize ones that normally lack a global presence – cut free from repetitive, redundant, cross-border regulatory burdens, the Saudis said.

The company is an example of legal, though untraditional, online businesses struggling with centralized payment processors: PayPal has blocked payments to the site without explanation, CoinDesk’s EU News Editor Daniel Palmer reports. The company has accepted verge (XVG) since 2018, and has recently added support for dollar-linked stablecoin tether (USDT).      Crypto for taxes People and businesses in the Swiss canton of Zug, home to ""Crypto Valley,"" will be able to pay their taxes in bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) beginning next February. Authorities have partnered with the Zug-based crypto broker and custodian Bitcoin Suisse, which will convert cryptocurrency payments into Swiss francs and hand them over to the tax office. The canton will accept tax payments up to 100,000 CHF (around $109,000) in those cryptos, though no partial payment will be accepted. In a statement Thursday, Zug Finance Director Heinz Tannler said the move would help to normalize the use of cryptocurrencies in everyday life.      Another Twitter hack Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India has become the latest victim of a Twitter hack meant to siphon cryptocurrency from unsuspecting users. A Twitter account of Modi's personal website known as the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) was hacked and began soliciting 2.5 million followers to donate to the relief fund using cryptocurrency, the Nikkei Asian Review reported and Twitter confirmed. The social media giant is ""not aware of additional accounts being impacted,"" a Twitter representative said. Modi’s hack follows a high-profile breach that compromised several accounts, including those of U.S. Democratic Presidential nominee Joe Biden, Tesla's Elon Musk, Kanye West and CoinDesk. The alleged perpetrators of that attack have been apprehended.      Full disclosure The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is calling upon Coinbase to release regular transparency reports related to the government and law enforcement requests for information it receives. In a Wednesday blog post, the digital advocacy nonprofit said financial data is one of the ""most sensitive types of information"" a user produces. The way Coinbase responds to government requests could ""have a huge impact on what types of speech thrive online,” CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair reports. In June, Coinbase initiated procurement deals with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), for its investigations tool called “Coinbase Analytics,” which traces transactions conducted across the exchange ecosystem.      COVID-19 relief The Congressional Blockchain Caucus is urging President Donald Trump and other federal officials to adopt blockchain solutions to boost COVID-19 relief efforts. In a Wednesday letter, lawmakers said blockchain technology can help identify and authenticate individuals set to receive government benefits, streamline supply chains and create a registry of medical professionals. They further cited blockchain’s strong encryption mechanism that protects sensitive data. The U.S. government’s response to a pandemic has been a case study in governmental inefficiency, with states duking it out over critical supplies. Last April, 11 representatives signed a letter calling on the U.S Treasury Department to consider blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLT) in streamlining the distribution of stimulus funds to citizens across the nation.

Derivatives exchange Opium has introduced CDS for the dollar-linked stablecoin tether (USDT), providing insurance to buyers in case Tether, the issuer of the stablecoin, defaults.      Tether, a key component of the crypto marketplace and fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, claims a 1-to-1 backing with U.S. dollars. This is often contested.      Tether revealed in April 2019 that only 74% of USDT was backed by “cash and cash equivalents.” The firm later said USDT was once again fully backed in a November 2019 retort to an academic paper that blamed the stablecoin for the 2017 bitcoin bubble.      Further, the firm behind the stablecoin is under investigation by the New York Attorney General’s office for alleged misappropriation of funds.      Opium’s CDS product finally lets the controversial crypto’s critics and defenders “put their money where their mouths are,” CoinDesk’s Will Foxley reports.      A CDS is a “transfer of the insurance from people who know and are confident to people who’d like to be insured. Derivatives are just about transferring the risk. Some people would like to have the risk and get paid, some people would like to pay to get rid of risk,” Opium founder Andrey Belyakov said.      The new CDS tethered to USDT can be customized to pay out under different scenarios, such as the stablecoin falling under a preset value, said Aave founder Stani Kulechov, who is advising Opium.      In this case, a sharp drop in USDT’s price from the usual $1 is used as a proxy for Tether turning out to be insolvent. So if the token fell to 70 cents, the writer of the contract would pay the buyer 30 cents at maturity.      Investors don’t need to hold USDT to purchase this coverage. They can use CDS to bet against the asset, while those who trust Tether to honor its obligations can earn a premium for standing ready to cover defaults.      Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer at Tether, said through a spokesman: “Tether is solvent. Therefore, this solution is not really interesting to us or our community.”    Market intel    Steep pullback Bitcoin (BTC) pulled back about $403 to $10,838 early Thursday, deepening a two-day sell-off that pushed the largest cryptocurrency to its lowest point in a month. CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole previously reported an influx of 92,000 BTC on Wednesday – the biggest-single day rise in 37 days – could deepen bitcoin’s descent. ""Inflows surged as people rushed to sell at near $12,000,"" Philip Gradwell, chief economist at Chainalysis, tweeted early Thursday. There’s evidence exchanges have not fully absorbed this selloff, hinting at a lack of buyers, which could lead to a profound drop in price.      Ether options Ether option contracts listed on Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange, rose to a record high of $507 million on Tuesday. This is possibly due to yield farming, the act of putting crypto holdings to work on decentralized applications to earn more crypto, Godbole reports. Open positions in ether options have surged by 45% from $349 million to $507 million over the past five days and nearly doubled since the end of July, while the total value locked (TVL) in the DeFi applications has surged by over 20% to $8.65 billion in the past five days.    Tech pod    Hypothetical attack A recently disclosed vulnerability in popular Trezor and KeepKey hardware wallets would have allowed attackers to hold users’ cryptocurrency for ransom without going anywhere near the device, CoinDesk’s Colin Harper reports. ShiftCrypto, the Swiss company that manufactures the BitBox hardware wallet, has disclosed a potential man-in-the middle ransom attack vector that leverages the two wallet’s optional passphrase feature users can use to unlock their device in lieu of a PIN. Trezor has issued a patch, KeepKey has delayed taking action, though it has not been suggested the hypothetical attack has been carried out.    Op-ed    DeFi, meet CeFi. Author of “The Business Blockchain,” William Mougayar thinks centralized finance and decentralized finance should link up for each other's benefit. “CeFi” will bring users and expertise to DeFi – which will struggle to grow beyond its pen of hardcore users – but must begin thinking like wholesalers and hurry to “pick the DeFi products they want to build on top of,” he writes. “The CeFi market potential is staring DeFi in the face. If CeFi exchanges want to start looking more like full-service financial services institutions, they need to become DeFi’s best distribution channels.”    Podcast corner    Policy shift?

Announced Thursday, Cozy Finance has raised a $2 million seed round, led by Electric Capital and including Variant Fund, Dragonfly Capital, Robot Ventures, Slow Ventures, Volt Capital, Spencer Noon, Moncada and others.      The team attempting to bring some order to the creative chaos that is DeFi consists of Cozy co-founders Tony Sheng, formerly of Multicoin Capital, and Payom Dousti, co-founder of Rare Bits, a peer-to-peer marketplace for crypto goods.      The value of assets deposited in Ethereum-based DeFi dapps has soared from $1 billion to over $8 billion in the span of six months. Developers have unlocked massive value for crypto investors by creating useful ways for them to manage their assets. However, these users face new forms of risk, like irreversible technical vulnerabilities.      See also: Retail Trading Platforms Pile Into $5M Funding Round for Zero Hash Crypto Settlements Firm      “As DeFi has grown, a clear and important hole are tools for people to be able to manage their risk appropriately,” Electric Capital co-founder Avichal Garg told CoinDesk. “Tony and Payom have deep experience in crypto and novel ideas on how to build risk management tools. We are thrilled to be working with them.”    DeFi hedging options    At the current moment, the transformative potential of DeFi is being hindered by a lack of appropriate risk management tools, the firms said in a Medium post.      “Today, the most common method of managing risk is ‘position sizing’ – even the most active users and funds aren’t deploying as much capital into the ecosystem as they’d like to,” Sheng told CoinDesk via email. “Part of this is that demand for risk management tools currently outstrips supply. The other part is that we have yet to see a truly ‘DeFi native’ ways to manage the risk.”      Other players trying to make DeFi safer include London-based Nexus Mutual, which runs a decentralized risk pool designed to hedge against DeFi smart contracts blowing up – something which appears more and more to be an acceptable risk of late.      But Sheng disagreed that blow-ups are simply part and parcel of the nascent DeFi economy.      “I don’t think anybody believes we should learn by making mistakes with user deposits,” he said. “Major blow-ups set the entire industry back. Better risk management is a key enabler of more experimentation.”      See also: SPiCE Takes Tokenized Blockchain VC Fund to Asia in Quest for Greater Liquidity      Asked how Cozy Finance compared with risk management in traditional finance, Sheng said the unique risks of DeFi require unique solutions.      “We’re building something that is – to our knowledge – quite new.

42405006,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKLkO,1599148053,The Crypto-Dollar Surge and the American Opportunity,"Stablecoins are a hot commodity. Over $16 billion of them circulate in the wild today, up from $4.8 billion to start the year. Mostly these are issued outside of the U.S., and so are largely unaccountable to financial regulators. If they keep growing, U.S. policymakers, in particular those in the state of New York, will have to stomach the loss of their dominance over dollar clearing. But because stablecoins represent a powerful neutral financial infrastructure, the U.S. should welcome their ascendance regardless.      It’s no secret that banking is highly politicized, often in informal or hard to apprehend ways. The overt politicization of the N.Y.-based correspondent banking system represents a tax on all users. Embedded in each transaction is a slight risk of censorship. Dependence on the system means submitting oneself to an American aegis. The harder it is to extricate yourself, the more you are subject to the demands of the administrator.      Banks and payment processors have also become more politicized, as they have begun to “de-risk” (read: de-platform) individuals and industry sectors with whom they disagree politically, or where they consider implied compliance costs too significant to be worth the hassle.      In February, I wrote that U.S. regulators should embrace the potential of stablecoins as continued instruments of dollar dominance. I stressed the potential welfare benefits of allowing savers in countries with inflationary regimes to engage with currency substitution without relying on the bank sector. Since February, the outstanding supply of stablecoins has grown from around $5.5 billion to $16 billion and their daily settled value has grown from about $1 billion daily to $4 billion daily. This phenomenon is no longer localized to the crypto industry. It has begun to cause geopolitical reverberations.    CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the cofounder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup. This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Internet 2030"" series.    First, stablecoins make for an excellent tool to avoid capital controls in oppressive monetary regimes. Chainalysis has reported that tether (USDT) is extremely popular in China, even recently exceeding bitcoin’s (BTC) usage in the region. It’s important to understand that the popularity of stablecoins or “crypto-dollars” is not solely due to their digital nature but because of the transactional freedom that they offer to users.    Policymakers should be thanking their lucky stars that a putative successor to the U.S.' financial infrastructure is a largely American phenomenon.    China’s financial system is highly digitized already. Crypto-dollars like tether offer a fundamentally different value proposition from AliPay or the state digital currency, DCEP, because they are bearer assets not subject to the same level of surveillance or transactional restrictions. Their digital nature isn’t what sets them apart; it’s the fact that you can permissionlessly accept or send any quantity of crypto-dollars with nothing more than a smartphone and trade it on a vast network of exchanges and brokers worldwide.      Today, crypto-dollarization is in full swing in places like Venezuela. Recently, Venezuelan President-in-exile Juan Guaido has begun promoting the usage of AirTM, a crypto-focused remittance company, to send U.S. dollars (USD) seized from the Maduro regime by the U.S. Treasury to health-care workers in Venezuela. Startups like Valiu are offering users digital access to the USD thanks to established crypto-financial infrastructure like LocalBitcoins. Crypto-dollars make sense because U.S. banks do not service Venezuelan users, even if regular Venezuelans are not formally sanctioned.      See also: Alejandro Machado - Venezuelans Look to Crypto-Dollars for Financial Security      Crypto-dollarization works because stablecoins are, for the most part, unencumbered by the shackles of the U.S. banking system. The largest issuer, Tether, relies on a network of offshore banks, and remains frustratingly outside the purview of the New York regulator, the Department of Financial Services (despite a long campaign to bring Tether to heel). Stablecoin issuers treat the IOUs as bearer instruments, and generally do not seek to police user behavior when a transaction does not involve the issuer. Users only need a relationship with the issuer if they are redeeming or creating stablecoins with bank dollars. By granting a measure of transactional privacy and not embedding political conditions into transactions, stablecoins are the closest thing to digital cash we have today. Notably, it is the private sector, not the state, that has delivered on this promise of digitally native cash.      Now, U.S. policymakers reading this might feel a profound sense of unease. New York is the center of the dollar universe. SWIFT, which the U.S. effectively controls, is unambiguously an instrument of power projection abroad. And the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Department of Justice have a habit of expressing political prescriptions through informal bank guidance and veiled threats. Touch a dollar anywhere – even in a transaction in which neither counterparty is American – and you’re obliged to Uncle Sam.      But these tools are wearing blunt with overuse. The more the U.S. threatens sanctions, the greater the incentive for its peers – allies included – to seek out alternatives. The more risk-averse and puritanical banks become, the stronger the tailwinds for non-bank alternatives. The more dissidents are de-platformed from U.S. payment processors, the better neutral alternatives start to look.      See also: Pascal Hügli - Hyper-Stablecoinization: From Eurodollars to Crypto-Dollars      Perhaps catalyzed by the growth of stablecoins, or more likely by the announcement of Facebook’s libra or China’s DCEP, various branches of the Federal Reserve are now industriously pursuing a “digital dollar.” But would such a project, regardless of its final form, grant transactors the autonomy that they deserve? Would a digital cash system produced by the Fed consist of an instant-settling, private bearer asset, as is the case with physical cash? Would an American central bank digital currency be able to credibly guarantee that its rich database wouldn’t be plundered in real time by Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as Larry White has wondered?      Today, the U.S. is still the center of gravity as far as bitcoin and the crypto-dollar ecosystem are concerned. This is a significant advantage that should not be squandered. Policymakers should be thanking their lucky stars that a putative successor to the U.S' financial infrastructure is a largely American phenomenon. The U.S. can continue to muddle down an increasingly exclusionary path and punish subscribers to its financial infrastructure by burdening them with political dictates, or it can embrace a neutral alternative. Self-disruption would be a significant bullet to bite, but it suits the U.S. Values like liberty, privacy, free enterprise and personal autonomy are embedded into our Constitution and social fabric. One can hardly think of a better nation to underwrite a shift to a truly neutral payments and settlement infrastructure.      See also: Nic Carter - Policymakers Shouldn’t Fear Digital Money: So Far It’s Maintaining the Dollar’s Status      While dollar infrastructure is likely to remain dominant far longer than some critics allege, it’s undeniable that banking and messaging have been deputized into carrying out the political objectives of their administrators. As relations with U.S. allies sour and China grows its sphere of influence in Asia, viable alternatives will be created. And if the DCEP is any guide, these alternatives will not encode strong privacy protections for end users. The U.S. is clearly suited to be the steward of a politically neutral payments technology, if our leaders can rise to the challenge.      If the U.S. chooses to marginalize crypto-dollars and punish their issuers, not only will they suppress a burgeoning American industry, they will also push users into even less accountable alternatives. While most stablecoins are backed by dollars in bank accounts – and are hence somewhat subject to governance – a subset are issued natively against crypto collateral like ether (ETH). These projects are more automated and lack the vectors of control and the linkages to the banking system that characterize convertible stablecoins. While still small, crypto-backed stablecoins like dai (current supply $455 million) take a more crypto-anarchist approach, and are harder to surveil or influence. More draconian regulation of crypto-dollars would not eliminate the category. Instead, it would push users into these slipperier alternatives.      The architects of these public digital dollar solutions should take a leaf from the private sector’s book. Users simply crave the qualities of cash, this time in a digital context. Far from being a dangerous techno-utopian fantasy, a genuine cash standard on the internet is simply a restoration of what was once ubiquitous and normal: transactional privacy and autonomy. These qualities are not for criminals but for everyone. And if policymakers dig in their heels, the private sector will only push back harder by providing the service that users demand – but this time outside policymakers' sphere of influence.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/03/the-crypto-dollar-surge-and-the-american-opportunity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7affb845c6c7350dfc99a0b86460d7fca6f81d58-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405005,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKLjP,1599144632,Bank of England Governor Wants Global Regulations as Stablecoins Pick Up Steam,"The governor of the Bank of England (BoE) has said stablecoins need global regulation, warning private issuers that an international regulatory framework could soon be in the cards.    Governor Andrew Bailey said regulators have to come together for a ""global response"" so they can effectively regulate stablecoins.  Speaking Thursday, he said the international nature of stablecoins, which can be based in one country and operate in another, meant failure to coordinate could result in confusion and regulatory fragmentation.  Bailey addressed an audience at the Hutchins Center on Fiscal & Monetary Policy of the Brookings Institution – a think tank that has called on policymakers to devise regulation for cryptocurrencies.  In a published speech, he said: ""[H]ost regulators of global stablecoins must, and are, working with other regulators in other jurisdictions to ensure that they are appropriately regulated and gaps in coverage, opportunities for regulatory arbitrage, do not emerge.""  While Bailey recognized stablecoins could reduce frictional costs, he emphasized that private issuers had to do more to ensure users can always redeem their stablecoins 1:1 with the underlying fiat currency.  He also warned that future stablecoin offerings may have to do more to satisfy regulatory standards at both a national and international level.  Compared to bitcoin, which he described as wholly unsuitable for payments, he said some stablecoin proposals could become the primary means for purchasing goods and services.  In a possible inference to Facebook's libra coin, he said discussions about multi-asset stablecoins were currently premature.  The BoE has previously toyed with the idea of launching a digital pound – even suggesting private companies could play a role in issuance.  It also joined a working group with five other central banks and the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) at the start of the year.

42405001,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKLfT,1599144325,"Buterin, Ethereum Developers Focus on Congestion as Fees Spike Over 600% in 1 Month","Ethereum developers are turning their focus back to the current version of the network after months of focus on the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 release to address exponential fee growth.    The surge in fees is being driven by the explosive popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications that are predominantly built on Ethereum.  Average network fees reached $15.21 on Wednesday, up 660% from $2 a month ago. Ethereum's median fees also spiked nearly 900% over the same period, reaching $8.95.  Moreover, the day after CoinDesk reported about new record highs Tuesday for transaction costs, average fees climbed another 24% and median fees spiked 37 percent.  In a bid to ameliorate soaring fees, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin released his Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 2929 Tuesday that proposes making certain heavy contracts more expensive by a factor of three. Contracts affected would be those that update the Ethereum state, including some applications.  This repricing proposal could break some smart contracts already operating on Ethereum, Buterin wrote. He added that developers “have had years of warning” about potential changes.  Approving this proposal, however, requires consensus from the Ethereum community, a process that can take weeks or months. Other broad-brush scaling solutions like EIP 1559 or sharding remain on the distant horizon as well.

Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team and edited by Bradley Keoun, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.    Price Point    Bitcoin was down early Thursday to about $11,250, extending Wednesday's sell-off and falling to its lowest price since early August. [Update: At press time prices had slumped further to around $10,850.]      The cryptocurrency tumbled 4.4% on Wednesday, the most in a month, leading to a heightened level of margin calls and position liquidations. Prices appeared to fall in sync with gold and silver prices, which tumbled as the dollar rebounded following a recent slide.      ""Failure to hold at the $12,000 level has turned the milk sour,"" the crypto trading firm Diginex wrote in a note to clients. ""Leveraged longs have been forced to drink it.""    Market Moves    With stocks soaring to new records after a decade-long climb, traders in traditional markets are asking how much higher they can go in the midst of a global pandemic, openly discussing whether the market is just propped up by government stimulus checks and Federal Reserve money injections.      The conversation around bitcoin is very different. The assumption among many digital-asset investors is the cryptocurrency's price will definitely, inevitably go higher, much higher. It's only a matter of time.      Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who run the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, wrote last week that bitcoin prices could reach $500,000, in an extensive analysis that somehow relates to a database of 600,000 asteroids.      Nobody really knows if any of that will pan out, of course. What's clear is a lot of investors have bought bitcoin because they see it as a deep out-of-the-money option (with no expiration date) on financial Armageddon, severe currency debasement or at the very least an inflation rate well above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. According to CoinDesk Research's monthly review published this week, bitcoin's price appears to be rising whenever the dollar falls in foreign-exchange markets.      Bitcoin costs $11,200 now, and it might be possible to lose it all, but it also might be worth $500,000 at some point. That's the general gambit anyway.      Invented just 11 years ago, bitcoin is exceedingly difficult to value partly because it has such a short track record. Similar to gold and many other commodities, the cryptocurrency offers no yield, so bond math won't work. Bitcoin has no earnings or dividend, so stock analysis won't work either.      Philip Bonello, director of research for the money manager Grayscale (owned by CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group), says his favorite chart for thinking about bitcoin's price trajectory might be one showing ""holders"" versus ""speculators."" A holder in this case is defined as a bitcoin that has not moved for one to three years, while a speculator coin has moved in the past 90 days.      An increase in holders is considered ""likely bullish,"" while an increase in speculators is ""likely bearish,"" according to a recent Grayscale report. The idea is that it's positive for the market if more investors appear to be holding the cryptocurrency for the long term, versus those who merely appear to be in it for a quick volatility ride.      Right now, the chart shows holders increasing and speculators decreasing. According to Grayscale, it's a ""similar structure to that of early 2016,"" just before bitcoin went on a bull run toward its all-time high around $20,000.      ""It's reassuring,"" Bonello said Wednesday in a phone interview, ""that the sentiment of the investor base is growing day by day."" The holders appear to have been unfazed by the volatility witnessed in March, when the spread of the coronavirus quickly sent bitcoin prices swooning from above $9,000 to below $5,000. ""It's probably unlikely that they're going to sell right now at $11,000,"" Bonello said.      All of this might mean nothing for the future price of bitcoin. It just shows that a growing number of investors are holding onto their tokens in a bet that the cryptocurrency's price will – or even that it might – eventually go up. By a lot.    Bitcoin Watch  Bitcoin may extend Wednesday's price pullback, as exchange flows indicate increased selling pressure in the market.  While the top cryptocurrency fell by 4% on Wednesday, it defended the long-held support zone of $11,100-$11,200. [Update: At press time prices had slumped further to below $10,850.]  The cryptocurrency may breach the support zone, as exchanges witnessed an inflow of 92,000 BTC on Wednesday – the biggest single day rise in 37 days, according to blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis.  ""Inflows surged as people rushed to sell at near $12,000,"" Philip Gradwell, chief economist at Chainalysis, tweeted early Thursday. In other words, the number of coins on exchanges, potentially poised for liquidation, increased.  ""I think there is still sell pressure to work through,"" Gradwell said.  A violation at immediate support at $11,170 would confirm a bearish reversal pattern on technical charts.

42404995,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKLZZ,1599138009,New Crypto Derivatives Let You Bet on (or Against) Tether's Solvency,"After years of debating whether tether (USDT) is fully backed 1-for-1 with U.S. dollars, the stablecoin’s critics and defenders alike can now put their money where their mouths are.      Opium, a derivatives exchange, has introduced credit default swaps (CDS) for USDT. The product, launched Thursday, insures the buyer in the event of default by Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin and fifth-largest cryptocurrency overall.      In this case, a sharp drop in USDT's price from the usual $1 is used as a proxy for Tether turning out to be insolvent. So if the token fell to 70 cents, the writer of the contract would pay the buyer 30 cents at maturity.      It’s the second time in a month that Opium has launched a CDS tied to a digital asset. Such contracts have been around on Wall Street since the 1990s and gained notoriety for their role in the 2008 global financial crisis.      However, they were invented to manage risk, and their prices arguably offer markets an early warning signal of credit troubles. Also, unlike the paper agreements litigated in “The Big Short,” these new CDS are smart contracts, executed by code on the Ethereum blockchain.      A CDS is a “transfer of the insurance from people who know and are confident to people who’d like to be insured. Derivatives are just about transferring the risk. Some people would like to have the risk and get paid, some people would like to pay to get rid of risk,” Opium founder Andrey Belyakov said in an interview.      Investors don’t need to hold USDT to purchase this coverage. They can use CDS to bet against the asset, while those who trust Tether to honor its obligations can earn a premium for standing ready to cover defaults.      ""You can use it to protect yourself against (or speculate on) a systemic failure of the most widely used stablecoin in crypto. It also allows you to earn interest on your capital in case you are willing to bet on the quality and sustainability of USDT,"" Opium said in a blog post to be published Thursday.      Read more: No Collateral Required: How Aave Brought Unsecured Borrowing to DeFi      Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer at Tether, said through a spokesman: ""Tether is solvent. Therefore, this solution is not really interesting to us or our community.""    Hedge for crypto exchanges    In late August, Opium Exchange rolled out a contract that insures the buyer against defaults on “credit delegation” loans, a form of unsecured borrowing on decentralized money market Aave.      For both CDS products, information about off-chain events that would trigger payouts (in this case, a change in USDT's price) is fed to the smart contracts by “oracle” service Chainlink, a 2020 standout project in terms of market adoption.      While fully collateralized smart contracts may remove the counterparty risk once embodied by AIG, they introduce a new kind of risk: bugs in the software. To mitigate this possibility, security firm SmartDec audited the new CDS' code and Opium itself.      The new CDS tethered to USDT can be customized to pay out under different scenarios, such as the stablecoin falling under a preset value, said Aave founder Stani Kulechov, who is advising Opium.      “You can insure Tether for the next one month [or] three months. And you can insure Tether at different price levels. You could set the credit default event to 95 cents or 90 cents. If it hits [that price point], that means it's a credit default event. The buyer of the CDS will get the amount covered,” Kulechov said.      As Opium’s blog points out, USDT is the lifeblood of the borderless cryptocurrency marketplace. It is designed to maintain its value in fiat currency, hence the term ""stablecoin."" The oldest stablecoin, USDT remains the largest such cryptocurrency by market cap and a top-five coin overall with $13.8 billion in issuance. Traders often use it to move money in and out of exchanges quickly to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities.      The firm behind the stablecoin is under investigation by the New York Attorney General’s office for alleged misappropriation of funds, along with its sister firm, crypto exchange Bitfinex.      Tether revealed in April 2019 that only 74% of USDT was backed by “cash and cash equivalents.” The firm later said USDT was once again fully backed in a November 2019 retort to an academic paper that blamed the stablecoin for the 2017 bitcoin bubble.      Read more: As Tether Supply Hits Record Highs, It Moves Away From Original Home      Either way, Belyakov said Opium’s CDS can act as a hedge for crypto exchanges that have large exposures to Tether’s solvency.      The derivative also functions as insurance for “long-tail risks” of rare events that are common to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and should soon be available for stablecoins USDC, BUSD and even algorithmic stablecoin dai (DAI), he said.

42405009,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKLmM,1599132846,Bitcoin Risks Deeper Price Pullback as Exchange Inflows Spike,"Bitcoin (BTC) may soon extend Wednesday's price pullback, according to a data metric that suggests there's increased selling pressure in the market.    While the top cryptocurrency by market value fell by 4% on Wednesday, it defended the long-held support zone of $11,100–$11,200.  Exchange platforms witnessed an inflow of 92,000 BTC on Wednesday, the biggest-single day rise in 37 days, according to blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis.  ""Inflows surged as people rushed to sell at near $12,000,"" Philip Gradwell, chief economist at Chainalysis, tweeted early Thursday.  Gradwell believes the selling pressure (arising from the exchange buildup of 92,000 BTC) has probably not been fully absorbed yet.  That's because bitcoin's median trade intensity, which measures the number of times an inflowing coin is traded, remained low at 3.113, well below the 180-day average.  Put simply, there were not enough buyers to match sellers.  As such, coins that weren't liquidated yesterday could still be offloaded into the market in the short run, causing a more profound price decline.  ""I think there is still sell pressure to work through,"" Gradwell said.  Bitcoin is currently trading near $11,300, representing a 0.7% decline on the day.  As discussed Wednesday, a violation at immediate support at $11,170 would confirm a bearish reversal pattern on the technical charts.

Sources speaking to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) for a report Wednesday said the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating the app-based trading platform  The allegations are that Robinhood, which is popular with retail investors, failed to disclose that it was selling order flow on its ""How We Make Money"" page – which was taken down in October 2018.  In the U.S., brokerages, like Robinhood, have to fully disclose all the material facts investors need to make an informed decision.  During this period, Robinhood did disclose in regulatory submissions that it was making revenue from order flow payments.  The SEC investigation is reportedly in an advanced stage, one WSJ source said.  CoinDesk approached Robinhood for comment but hadn't received a response by press time.  Payment for order flow is a practice where brokerage firms are compensated for routing customer orders to market makers for execution.  This creates business for market makers; for brokerages, it saves them executing thousands of varied and complex orders, creating a new source of revenue instead.  While legal, some have argued that selling order flow creates conflicts of interest for brokerage firms.  Robinhood does now disclose that it makes money from rebates from market makers, and argues that it helps create better prices for the customer.  Although Robinhood and the SEC haven't yet entered formal fine negotiations, one WSJ source said the trading app could be looking at a $10 million settlement.  A settlement could save Robinhood from having to admit to misconduct, one source said.  Robinhood offers trading of stocks, exchange-traded funds and options, as well as 17 cryptocurrencies.

Previously Revolut conducted cryptocurrency transactions on behalf of its customers.  The fintech firm began its foray into crypto in the summer of 2017 after completing a $66 million series B funding round led by Index Ventures, BitPay, Xapo, Balderton Capital and Ribbit Capital.

42384596,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAkgJh,1599120113,Digital Rights Advocacy Group Calls On Coinbase for Greater Transparency,"A nonprofit that champions digital rights wants Coinbase to be more transparent in how it handles authorities' requests for users' private financial data.    In a post on its website Wednesday, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) argued that the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange should begin releasing regular transparency reports.  These should detail the number of government and law enforcement requests for information Coinbase receives and how it goes about dealing with those requests, the EFF said.  Financial data is one of the ""most sensitive types of information"" a user produces, the group went on.  Further, the EFF suggested that how Coinbase responds to government requests could ""have a huge impact on what types of speech thrive online.""  Founded in 1990, the EFF is a nonprofit organization that sets out to defend ""civil liberties in the digital world"" by championing user's privacy, free expression and grassroots activism.  Cryptocurrency exchanges should ""especially understand"" the importance of privacy, given their users tend to value censorship resistance and anonymity, the EFF said.  Unlike Coinbase, Kraken, a rival U.S.-based crypto exchange, received high praise for its apparently transparent behavior around requests for information from government and law enforcement agencies.  Kraken ""already recognized the importance of being open on this topic,"" said the group, pointing to a tweet in January of a 2019 transparency report showing the U.S. topped the number of requests for information.  Coinbase built its reputation as a reliable platform by stressing regulatory compliance from the start.  In June, the exchange initiated procurement deals with a number of U.S. agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), for a cryptocurrency investigations tool called “Coinbase Analytics.”  The tool enables tracing of transactions conducted across Coinbase, with the IRS claiming the tool possessed ""capabilities that are not currently found in other tools on the market.""  At the time, Coinbase told CoinDesk the analytics data was ""fully sourced from online, publicly-available data, and does not include any personally identifiable information for anyone.""  The exchange has made disclosures about how it would deal with requests for user data.  In 2018, Coinbase told 13,000 customers it would share “only certain limited categories of information” following demands from the Internal Revenue Service, though it did not disclose precise details.  It had previously tried to fight the tax agency's request for the information of 14,000 customers in a lengthy legal battle, but ultimately the court sided with the IRS.  By releasing transparency reports, the EFF said Coinbase could ""display leadership"" and ""fill in the gaps"" of current knowledge ""by simply shining a much-needed light on government requests for information.""  Coinbase declined to comment for this article.

According to a report by the Nikkei Asian Review on Thursday, a Twitter account of Modi's personal website known as the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) was hacked.  A series of tweets were posted by hackers asking the PMNRF's 2.5 million followers to donate to the relief fund using cryptocurrency, Twitter has confirmed.  It is unclear whether funds were sent to a private wallet address or how much may have been siphoned off.  Funds from the PMNRF are generally used to provide relief to families of those killed in natural disasters such as floods, cyclones, and earthquakes. Donations are usually paid in fiat.  ""We are actively investigating the situation,"" a Twitter spokeswoman said in an email statement cited in the Nikkei. The social media giant is ""not aware of additional accounts being impacted,"" she said.  The event follows the recent hacks that compromised several high-profile accounts, including those of U.S. Democratic Presidential nominee Joe Biden, Tesla's Elon Musk, Kanye West and CoinDesk.  The attacks used celebrity accounts in order to deceive unsuspecting victims into handing over their bitcoin through a rudimentary giveaway scam promising to double a victim's funds if they sent it to a particular address.  In late July, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and local officials arrested three young men in the U.S. in connection with the hacks – including alleged mastermind Graham Ivan Clark.  Clark has pleaded not guilty to all charges brought against him.  It is unclear whether those attacks might be related to the one on Modi.    The Modi incident is another sobering reminder to always think twice before sending crypto to strangers on the internet, even if there's a blue check and the portrait of a head of state in the profile.
