42398898,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhI0r,1456267545,Japan Considers Regulating Bitcoin as Currency,"UPDATE (24th February 3:35am BST): This piece has been updated with comment from Japan's Financial Services Agency.      Regulators in Japan have reportedly proposed treating digital currencies like bitcoin as methods of payment, a distinction that would make them legally equivalent to conventional currencies in the country.  According to a report by Nikkei, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is considering whether to make revisions to legislation that would classify digital currencies as ""fulfilling the functions of currency"".  ""They are now recognized as objects but are not treated on a par with their more established counterparts,"" the report states, adding:  ""Under the FSA's proposed definition, virtual currencies must serve as a medium of exchange, meaning that they can be used to purchase goods and services. They must also be exchangeable for legal tender through purchases or trades with an unspecified partner.""  As a result of the change, financial institutions would need to register with the FSA, a policy regulators believe could help prevent a scenario similar to the collapse of Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, which lost millions in consumer funds to insolvency in 2014.  The news comes amid a broader conversation ongoing in Japan over how digital currency exchanges should be regulated under know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) statutes.  Nikkei adds that the proposed changes are expected to be submitted during the current legislative session of the Diet, Japan's legislature, which runs from 4th January to 1st June, with any changes being approved before the session concludes.  Despite the article, the FSA told CoinDesk that ""nothing has been decided yet"" and that it has yet to take any official action on the treatment of digital currency.

42398903,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhI5m,1456266399,CFTC Hearing Explores Role of Regulators in Blockchain Future,"The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) Technology Advisory Committee discussed how blockchain applications could reshape the derivatives market at a meeting today in with special attention was paid to the need for industry standards and collaboration.  The hearing  , originally announced in January but later postponed, featured testimony from representatives from both traditional finance firms as well as startups in the blockchain space.  Notably, the CFTC commissioners present indicated a willingness to avoid cumbersome regulatory demands on the still-nascent technology, with CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad remarking that, despite questions about what industry problems blockchain tech could solve, the agency doesn't want to prevent any possible benefits.  Massad stated:  ""I think I can speak for my fellow commissioners in saying, you know, we want to make sure we're at least not standing in the way of new technological developments, and potentially encouraging technological developments that can be beneficial.""  Commissioners Sharon Bowen and J Christopher Giancarlo also struck positive notes during comments, with Giancarlo expressing a stronger interest for blockchain applications in financial markets.  In opening remarks  , Giancarlo remarked that, in his belief, the technology ""will have enormous implications"" for the finance world, with applications for payments, securities settlement, banking and other sectors.  ""Open ledgers may also make possible new 'smart' securities and derivatives that will revolutionize operational and transactional efficiency,"" Giancarlo continued. ""They may help reduce some of the enormous cost of the increased financial system infrastructure required by new laws and regulations, including Dodd-Frank.""  These remarks echo comments made by Giancarlo late last year, when he suggested that the technology could result in a reduction of jobs in the financial sector should adoption take place.  Panelists during the blockchain session included Sandra Ro, head of digitization for CME Group; Brady Levy, head of processing for MarkIt; Robert Sams, CEO of Clearmatics; and James Slazas, CFO for ConsenSys.  Push for clarity, collaboration  During testimony, those on the panel and the advisory committee appeared to agree that, as it stands today, the possible applications of blockchain tech in financial markets, particularly in derivatives markets, are still being examined.  Ro remarked that one of a number of lingering questions is how digitized assets, in this case tokens on a blockchain, would be governed under the law – particularly in the event of an issuing organization's insolvency.  ""I think one of the big hurdles that we need to figure out is...what happens in the event of a default, or a bankruptcy,"" she said. ""What regimes would cover these tokenized assets? And if they're in transit from one jurisdiction to another, do these tokenized assets become recognized under law?""  The topic of collaboration between both financial institutions and regulators was frequent during the hearing.  For example, Levy remarked that there is a strong willingness among financial incumbents to engage in this process, highlighting that MarkIt believes open-source code will be an important aspect of this process.  ""Even if you think about the words that are used in this space, share, peer to peer, distributed, all assume some level of collaboration,"" he said. ""And then we actually think open source is going to have a really big role in this space, probably more so than any other initiative in our industry, maybe ever.""  Regulatory inclusion discussed  One subject that came up during the hearing was how regulatory bodies would conduct oversight of blockchain networks.  According to the panelists, this process could result in regulators maintaining nodes on a distributed network or being given special access to the data on these networks.  Ro remarked:  ""I can attest from a CME group perspective the few consortium industry consortiums that we're a member of, there is very much the inclusion of regulatory bodies to be at least, in the very least an observer status in the network, or, further to that, you know, having additional powers inside of the network.""  Slazas echoed these comments, suggesting that regulators like the CFTC would have access to a ""dashboard"" giving them a window into what’s happening in a particular network.  ""I think that in just a few short years that we would be able to provide some type of mechanism where you have a window into that space, and I think it can be done in parallel to what is being done currently, off the blockchain,"" he said.  While no indications were given as to specific actions the CFTC may take, it was suggested by some committee members during the hearing that aspects of existing regulations be adjusted to account for blockchain use.  In closing statements, the commissioners said further discussion and fact-finding about the technology is needed and encouraged.

42398905,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhI7k,1456259128,"Orix, Shizuoka Become Latest Japanese Banks to Trial Blockchain","A group of Japanese banks and technology companies, including Orix, Shizuoka Bank, NTT Data and NTT DoCoMo Ventures, have formed a new blockchain research initiative.  Announced today, the news marks the latest move by members of Japan's finance and technology sectors to embrace or experiment with blockchain technology.  As a result of the announcement, NTT Data, a professional services firm with a focus on IT consulting, will work with digital currency startup Orb to research the technology with the initiative's partners.  Orix and Shizuoka, the banks involved with the project, said they plan to test international remittance and transaction settlement applications of the tech. Orix is a consumer-focused financial services firm founded in the 1960s, while Shizuoka Bank, one of Japan’s regional financial institutions, was founded in the 1940s.  NTT DoCoMo Ventureshttps://www.nttdocomo-v.com/en/  , the venture arm of major mobile network operator NTT DoCoMO, will act as mediator between the major companies involved.  Further, the group says it intends to branch out beyond financial applications of the technology, noting:  ""The companies also plan to work with partners from various industries to investigate applications to services using blockchain technology in fields of business besides finance.""  Sea change in Japan  The announcement comes amid an increase in awareness in blockchain technology among Japanese financial services firms.  Earlier this month, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFG) disclosed that it was working on an internal digital currency project, while more recently, financial services giant Mizuho announced that it is working with Microsoft Japan on a trial system for syndicated loans.  Activity can also be seen on the investment side, as regional finance group SBI Holdings has made recent investments in bitcoin and blockchain startups like Kraken and Ripple through its venture arm.

42378613,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iqEN,1456251824,UK Financial Regulator Vows to Give Blockchain 'Space' to Grow,"The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said it does not plan to regulate the blockchain industry for now as it believes the technology will need ""space"" to grow.  The news was delivered yesterday in a speech by Christopher Woolard, the FCA's director of strategy and competition, who took a focus on innovation at the start of London London Fintech Week.  Describing innovation as an ""iterative process"", Woolard said that it is ""crucial"" that innovators are given space to develop their solutions. He further framed the development of distributed ledger technology as a potential revolution in financial services, though he cautioned it has yet to be seen if the tech is ""the panacea of all ills in the financial world"".  Moving onto the authority's position on regulation of the blockchain businesses, Woolard said:  ""The FCA continues to monitor the development of this technology but is yet to take a stance until its application is clearer.""  Woolard went on to state that he believes there are ""regulatory and consumer issues"" that will need to be examined as the technology evolves, such as how individuals gain access to a distributed financial network and which entities control this access.  Additionally, he cited levels of data security for users as a further ""vital consideration"" for the FCA.  The FCA regulates domestic financial firms providing services to consumers, and is also charged with helping to maintain the integrity of UK financial markets  Applications for regulators  During the speech, Woolard took the time to discuss the FCA's Project Innovate initiative, launched in October 2014 to help startups improve policies and processes.  The FCA chief explained that the FCA will continue to work with firms developing distributing ledger technology solutions via the innovation scheme to ensure ""consumer protections are being factored in during the development phase of this technology"".  Woolard further explained that the FCA had identified some ""key opportunities"" in applying the technology to the needs of regulators, which he termed ""RegTech"".  He said:  ""[This area] is an opportunity for us to understand how we can best support developments and potentially adopt some RegTech solutions ourselves.""  Of particular interest to the authority is whether blockchain technology can help companies across industries meet know-your-customer (KYC) or anti-money laundering (AML) requirements ""more efficiently and effectively"".  The FCA is currently engaged in discussions with government and industry on the issue, he indicated.  Blockchain-friendly stance  To date, the UK has taken an extremely open stance on both digital currencies and blockchain technology, issuing a number of official statements and initiatives expressing a willingness to help the industry develop.  In October 2015, the economic secretary to the UK Treasury, Harriet Baldwin MP, spoke about the benefits of digital currencies and blockchain technology, explaining that the government was working to create the right regime for digital currency businesses that would attract both overseas investors and companies to the UK.  This January, a report from the UK Government Office for Science recommended a broad government effort to explore and test blockchain and distributed ledger technology.  The report, headed by the government's top scientific advisor Mark Walport, contained proposals aimed at pushing for segments of the UK government to pursue applications of the technology.

42378632,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iqZl,1456246836,Ripple: Distributed Ledger Tech Can Save Banks 42% on Payments,"Ripple has projected that banks that use the Ripple network and its native cryptographic token XRP for cross-border payments can save up to 42% when compared against today's options.  The findings are part of a new 15-page report issued today by the distributed ledger technology (DLT) startup. Entitled ""The Cost-Cutting Case for Banks"", it finds Ripple offering clarity as to the cost-savings its products can realize for the first time.  Further, the report projects respondent banks using Ripple without XRP can save 33% on international payments, with savings being generated by a 65% reduction in liquidity costs, a 48% drop in payment operations costs and a 99% decline in Basel III compliance costs.  The release comes at a time when blockchains and distributed ledgers are being widely touted as having the potential to bring new efficiencies and savings to a variety of industries, particularly finance. However, there has been a lack of information as to the levels of such savings the technologies can achieve, largely since most projects are still in development or are being built behind closed doors.  Ripple instead has the advantage of experience working with financial institutions including a number of banks, as well as Western Union, Japan's SBI Holdings and global payment hub Earthport.  Still, the projected figures are based on ""model assumptions"", meaning its unclear how the report was informed by any real-world data about its clients' use of the service.  Support for XRP  Perhaps most notable about the report is its implications for XRP, the cryptocurrency that is used to facilitate trades on the permissioned Ripple DLT system and that trades on an open market on digital currency exchanges.  More recent Ripple announcements have found the company largely glossing over the role of XRP in its system. For example, the Interledger protocol, released in October, sought to create a way to exchange funds between ledgers without a ""digital asset"", as it is described in the report.  Like bitcoin and other digital assets, XRP is a store of value that can be transferred between parties anywhere in the world without a central counterparty. However, Ripple stresses that XRP can also support liquidity between any two currencies, acting as a bridge asset.  Instead of holding local currency in many accounts around the world, banks can instead bring their liquidity for global payments into just one XRP account, the paper argues.  ""This singular XRP pool then allows respondent banks to allocate less total liquidity to service the same volume of international payments,"" Ripple writes.  Further, this process allows banks to minimize the number of intermediaries involved and their markup on spread, it says.  As a result, claims Ripple, respondent banks that use the Ripple network with XRP as a bridge currency can save up to 42% on costs today, and potentially up to 60% as XRP gains usage and volatility decreases.  As for whether bitcoin and other blockchain platforms can provide similar savings, Ripple says that's a ""different story"".  Cutting out the middlemen  The bulk of the report, however, finds Ripple analyzing the ROI of a respondent bank using Ripple in several scenarios.  Summarising the problem today, the firm explains that cross-border payments are processed through a chain of banks with each intermediary representing a ""potential point of delay, failure and cost"".  Smaller, respondent banks depend on large correspondent banks to provide liquidity for their cross-currency payments, but are required to maintain liquidity in nostro (foreign) accounts with the correspondent banks.  The costs of this process make servicing certain types of cross-border payments, such as low-value payments, unprofitable for banks.  However, DLT-based solutions like Ripple, enable ""instant, point-to-point settlement"", reducing these liquidity requirements, the firm says. Furthermore, by providing end-to-end visibility, Ripple reduces operational costs associated with reconciling exceptions and failures.

42378622,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iqPh,1456203192,Mediachain is Using Blockchain to Create a Global Rights Database,"One of the biggest, still-dormant use cases for blockchain technology is in the field of media – the overarching term capturing a slew of creative professions whose traditional business models have been upended by lightning-fast digital file replication.  Across various fields, the problems are clear: writers, photographers and musicians lack the ability to prove and protect ownership of their works and ideas, a prospect that renders monetization in a digital environment difficult.  In the face of this challenge, blockchain tech, with its ability to provide provenance, identity and micropayments has emerged as a potential antidote.  One of the more unique projects innovating in this area is Mediachain, a newly launched metadata protocol that allows digital creators to attach information to their creative works, timestamp that data to the bitcoin blockchain and store it with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a distributed file system incorporating aspects of blockchain technology.  To Jesse Walden and Denis Nazarov, co-founders of Mine, the startup behind the Mediachain project, entrepreneurial innovators approaching the space have too often tried to undo how the Internet has changed media business models, rather than help those affected work more effectively within the parameters of this new reality.  As an example of its thesis, Mediachain is beginning its work by focusing on image data and attribution, using machine learning and blockchain tech to offer a service whereby users can not only attach identifying information to files, but reverse query files to search for creators.  At launch, the focus of the project will be on pictorial works, as Nazarov told CoinDesk:  ""With drag and drop and copy and paste, images are the easiest media type to share on the Internet. Images travel virally, but it’s hard for the creators and content owners to benefit. We really see Mediachain as a global rights database for images.""  When used in conjunction with a service like Instagram, Nazarov and Walden envision a future where users who wanted to repost an image would be able to pull up historic information on the file using Mediachain.  In this light, they see the effort as a way to help preserve identity, even if enforcing the rights and monetizing such content may be, in their own words, ""an impossible problem"".  On a sufficiantly long timeline, such a reliable metadata database could enable the creation of new platforms, Walden and Nazarov contend, such as a next-generation Spotify or Netflix, which would be able to easily access identifying information for creative works.  ""The goal of Mediachain is to unbundle identity and distribution. We’re the identity layer on which distribution platforms can be built,"" Walden said.  Lessons from the past  Walden and Nazarov have also identified what they believe to be a viable point of attack in order for the Mediachain platform to gain wider use – public institutions that offer open data sets for images used in galleries, libraries and archives.  “Part of their public mandate is to have openly licensed metadata about their works. The Metropolitan Museum of Art might have its own metadata platform, it might have an API and there’s lots of interesting projects being built on top of them,” Nazarov said.  In particular, he cited efforts by the New York Public Library to make maps with its historical images available to the public. The co-founders said that by focusing on this group, they could help bootstrap the effort as they seek to encourage the platform’s wider use in consumer-facing projects.  In initial blog posts, Mine has provided details as to its choice of architecture for the platform, and why it believes IPFS was the best option for the database when compared to alternatives such as the bitcoin blockchain or even a newly created blockchain.  Mine has cited IPFS’ ability to store ""richly structured data"" in what they contend is a more readable format than alternatives. This was of interest, Walden said, because Mediachain features only descriptions of media, not the actual files themselves.  Still, Walden argued that the decentralized nature of Mediachain is crucial to its efforts given the past failures of the Global Repertoire Database (GRD), one of the more high-profile, high-investment attempts to create a database of musical rights and works.  Launched in 2008, the effort saw stakeholders from across the tech and recording industries come together to invest €23m-€32m in a digital rights management system, only to have the GRD fall apart amid missed deadlines and fights over funding.  Walden said that the lesson from the effort is that a centralized solution is not best equipped to handle the storage of digital rights, adding:  ""The goal of that project is similar to our goal, but our belief is that a GRD will need to be decentralized.""  Building trust  Given its design, however, Mediachain has had to adapt to future challenges even before its launch, for example, how it might deal with bad actors who want to claim ownership to the works of others.  Here again Walden and Nazarov cited their strategy of engaging public institutions as an example of how the platform will seek to acquire the trust of its users.  The Mine team said they have been working on a platform that would allow Mediachain users to annotate images, but use a reputation system so that others can begin to trust the information on its platform.  “I could claim I made the Mona Lisa, so the way we think about it is, this federated approach lets you trust people to vouch for a metadata’s correctness. That is where we see the value will be,” Nazarov said.  They also suggested they believe the Mediachain community would gain or lose trust over time depending on how it maintains its open-access resource.  Here, Nazarov cited the success of past Internet community efforts and their ability to achieve reputation as evidence that the approach could prove successful.  ""On Wikipedia, if you read an article about George Bush, you believe that it’s factual because Wikipedia is a credible source,"" Nazarov explained.  Major media applications  Once off and running, the Mine team believes Mediachain could be incorporated into existing popular social media platforms.  New media companies like Tumblr, they said, could enable its users to search images, even those substantial altered by subsequent creators, by using its API. This, in turn, they said, would enable Tumblr to better monetize through improved analytics.  ""As soon as the content hits Tumblr, they lose all analytics. An incentive is you get cross-platform analytics and we think that is a compelling incentive for larger platforms,"" Nazarov said.  Futhermore, Nazarov and Walden see applications as Facebook and Apple both explore deals that could see them hosting the content of major global media outlets.  With reliable information on identity and rights, Nazarov and Walden suggested these efforts would be better able to meet the needs of even major business content creators.  ""The idea here is that, as a publisher, CoinDesk would be able to publish an article and set the terms for that article for it to be consumed in an application like Facebook Instant Articles,"" Nazarov said.  They went so far as to project that new efforts could spring up more easily, allowing innovation on a platform layer that has so far produced mostly market-leading players such as Spotify and Netflix, with few competitors in between.  For now, however, Mediachain cautions that its use of new technology may slow its efforts, as IPFS is best described as a ""bleeding-edge"" technology, and its ability to advance on development goals may affect their own roadmap.  Further, the Mediachain team sees subsequent issues in ensuring the durability of its database, as well as in creating standards for metadata.  Still, the platform is now soliciting developers for its efforts to attack such challenges, cautioning in its launch post:  ""We are only getting started.""
