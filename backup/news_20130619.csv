42424984,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXJTh,1371652840,Green address – the solution to slow Bitcoin transactions?,"One of the reasons Bitcoin has experienced a degree of success over other digital currencies is its ability to overcome what is known as the double-spend problem. Double spending, for many years, had been a vexing issue for any sort of e-currency: how to avoid someone from having the ability to send money to one party while simultaneously sending it to another.  Double spending is not a problem that exists in physical fiat-based currencies. This is due to the fact that one can duplicate files that make up a digital system much more easily than the time and effort it takes to counterfeit something like paper money. For digital currencies, a host of problems can result from double spending as it can easily destroy confidence and has been one of the reasons why money that is not backed by a government has struggled to take off – until now.  Bitcoin solves the double spending issue by utilizing proof of work, requiring that a mathematical problem set be solved in order for a transaction to be validated. This resolves the predicament of double spending, but can cause another problem: transactions require a period of time before they are completed. In Bitcoin's case, it can take up to an hour for a transaction to confirm. This is a problem, because one feature that has become an expectation from digital money is speedy transactions.  This is one of the reasons why Litecoin is an alternative to Bitcoin; that currency’s proof of work uses a different algorithm method called scrypt over the SHA-256 hash technology used in Bitcoin. Many have agreed that scrypt is a faster method for verifying transactions. But although Litecoin can be a solid number two to Bitcoin in the market for decentralized currencies, it just doesn’t have the widespread adoption of Bitcoin – and it's easy to question when it will, given that for now it is harder to obtain.  A way that parties can speed up transactions in Bitcoin itself is by utilizing something called marker addresses. In a paper called “ Marker Addresses: Adding Identification Information to Bitcoin Transactions to Leverage Existing Trust Relationshipshttp://www.bitcoinmonitor.com/static/paper/marker-addresses.pdf,” author Jan Vornberger describes a process that has come to be known in Bitcoin circles as the “green address approach”.  Using Bitcoin’s own communications channel, parties are able to establish trust through an address that has been commonly identified as a ""marker"". This, in effect, is able to reduce the time it takes for a transaction to complete since a receiver is already waiting, or “listening” for an address to send money. By utilizing the already existing Bitcoin protocol to do this, listening makes the green address approach an easy feature to implement, since there is nothing to build on top of the already existing system.  The more complicated understanding of green addresses is laid out in this chart. A “marker” Bitcoin address is made known publicly. A small amount of Bitcoins is held at that address, in order to provide a corresponding key for redemption. When sending or receiving bitcoins from a party that is trusted, a transmission includes the publicly known green address in the transaction. This, in effect, speeds transaction time – no need to wait for confirmation when the address is used.  An example of one of these addresses is one used for the Bridgewalker mobile app. You can see the outgoing transactions taking place, since that Bitcoin address is publicly known in order to establish the trust element to make the process work.  Jan Vornberger, who wrote the paper about marker addresses, recognizes there are drawbacks to this green address approach. “It does not magically solve the instant transaction problem for everyone. It just offers a way to mark your transactions so that you can leverage your reputation among anyone who recognizes and trusts you,” he said.  This system offers no promise of anonymity; in fact, green addresses are recognizable on the blockchain, since they are public to be used to represent trust. The additional transaction inputs that validate are also included in the blockchain and are recognizable. Yet, even despite potential negatives, green addresses are being used because they can easily be implemented in the existing Bitcoin system. Mt Gox has been using them since 2011 and when you go to withdraw bitcoins from Mt. Gox, you can select the option to use a green address.  “I hope that this fairly simple mechanism can offer a way to speed up transactions between larger entities that trust each other, without having to build a custom solution for each partnering organization,” Vornberger tells CoinDesk.  That's what is really important about this concept. In order for a payment to be accepted by a party, it needs to have some sort of confirmation. Having to wait an hour for a transaction to confirm on the blockchain is troublesome for so many reasons that it doesn't ensure any sort of confidence. That's why something like point of sale applications is one useful reason for the green address approach. Confirming large transactions would be another use. With the green address approach, a transaction can go through immediately instead of what can be described as a tedious delay.  While a developer could, in theory, build something on top of Bitcoin’s existing protocol to make something similar to green addresses possible, not a lot of work has been done in that regard. One developer has devised a point of sale application, which is necessary in order to confirm transactions just as is currently done with credit or debit cards. It can utilize the green address approach and can also use its own method to help validate and speed transactions.  It may just be that the long-term result is a system that validates transactions outside of the Bitcoin protocol. But for now, the green address approach works.  What reasons do you find the green address approach useful? Do you think that at some point there will be another method that might be used in order to validate Bitcoin transactions?",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | LTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/19/green-address-the-solution-to-slow-bitcoin-transactions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/48bc23b9d671b2029732d568b4f874ced9581045-386x254.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424981,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXJJh,1371641439,First of Butterfly Lab's BitForce 500 GH/s mining rigs seen in operation,"The first 500 gigahash per second ASIC mining rig from Butterfly Labs has been put into operation, as reported on the Bitcoin Forum. We recently reported on the first shipment of the Bitforce SC 60 desktop miner, and at the other end of the hashing spectrum is Butterfly Lab's BitForce 500 GH/s unit. Until yesterday, none had been seen in the wild.  Bitcoin forum member gigavps posted a photo of a mining room filled with rigs. Most of which are reportedly field-programmable gate array (FPGA) devices. However, the large unit centred in the photograph with two grey power plugs is the Butterfly Lab's BitForce 500 GH/s unit that has caught the attention of many.  At the time of posting, gigavps warned that the unit would be repeatedly shut down while ckolivas, who was assisting, modified the machine's software to optimise performance. After some tweaking, the device was said to have been left to run continuously for two hours, and was shown to have an average hash rate of 478.1 GH/s. As you can see in the table below, ASIC number four (of a total of eight hashing chips) ran significantly hotter (86 degrees) and consequently gave the highest hardware (HW) error rate.  When asked what type of cooling was being used for the menagerie of miners, gigavps replied, ""12 tons of high powered dc hvac"". When asked about the mining rig's power consumption, gigavps estimated that each 500 GH/s unit should consume ""2,300 to 2,400 Watts"". However, that power estimate was not confirmed in the forum thread.  Forum user Syke criticised the unit's performance for being short of what had been originally planned by Butterfly Labs.  It was supposed to be 1500 GH/s @ 1500 watts in October '12. Now it's 500 GH/s at 2400 watts in June '13. They didn't ""come through"". They blew it.  The unit referenced by Syke is shown on Butterfly Lab's website here and was detailed in October 2012 by Bitcoin Magazine. Another forum member, crazyates, responded by saying: ""They will be compensating customers with 3x the number of units, so you will be getting the same hashrate as what you paid for"". However, we could not confirm this information.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/19/first-of-butterfly-labs-bitforce-500-ghs-mining-rigs-seen-in-operation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8bd1924684ef8defb4decc4f7e6da7af9043bc38-800x400.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424976,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXJFh,1371637819,"TerraHash opens ASIC mining preorders, loses business","TerraHash  , the Californian company which has been promising Avalon-based ASIC miners, has started taking preorders on its website – but has also lost over $100,000 worth of business due to late delivery.  The company, which announced its entry into the ASIC mining market just over a month ago, is promising a device it is calling the DX Large. It will use boards designed to contain ASIC chips manufactured by BitSynCom, which has announced that it will sell those chips independently to manufacturers.  TerraHash had previously said that it wouldn’t take payment for products until they were ready to ship, but yesterday it backtracked on that policy, opening up a preorder option on its web site, even though it will be at least 4-6 weeks before customers see their units.  “Customer demand was one of the biggest reasons,” Amir Khan, a director at TerraHash, told CoinDesk. Another was logistical. “We wanted to ensure that we had a constant supply, and for that we needed more money to buy more chips.”  In the meantime, the firm has lost its biggest customer to date. Emmanuel Abiodun, founder of UK-based cloud mining company Cloudhashing, has cancelled his order with the company.  Abiodun originally ordered $105,000 of equipment from TerraHash, sending $79,109.13 up front on 14th of May (for which he complains he didn't get a receipt). This was an upfront payment, with the remainder stored in a company savings account to ringfence it. However, on June 4, he issued a formal request for a refund.  “We made the order while being led to believe that we would get the hardware at the end of June,” said Abiodun. For people like him, ASIC mining business is all about getting the first products to secure an early advantage before more ASIC power piles into the network and sends mining difficulty soaring. “If they deliver in mid-July then it doesn’t give us much advantage over when Butterfly Labs would deliver.”  Cloudhashing had also ordered ASIC miners from TerraHash competitor Butterfly Labs. Although it hasn’t cancelled those orders, it won’t be placing any more, either.  One other reason for the TerraHash cancellation was down to product quality. “The Avalon chips are very power-inefficient. On that basis, the scalability isn't workable,” he said. When TerraHash was working to a late June delivery date, it was still worth getting the equipment for the short-term time advantage. When the deadline slipped, it wasn’t worth pursuing.  Abiodun, who has now opted for Swedish ASIC mining equipment vendor KnCMiner, also criticised Avalon and TerraHash’s communication skills.  “The problem I have with Avalon is that it seems to have taken more of a hobbyist approach to getting things done. The fact that I can't even get the Avalon guys to talk on the phone with me is a big worry for me in the first place,” he said, adding that he also struggled to get TerraHash to talk with him on the phone. “I would rather talk to people who are focused on providing customer service. I’m looking for long-term business relationships.”  Khan said that the loss of the Cloudhashing order was “not a big deal,” arguing that it had little effect on the manufacturer.  He also responded to the power efficiency criticism. Avalon’s chips are built using a less dense fabrication technology to Butterfly Labs’ chips, leading to a difference in power efficiency, admitted Khan. However, “our industrial engineer did all the simulations, so we don't see any heat issues,” he added.  The Avalon chips should hit TerraHash’s loading dock by mid-late July. “Once we have those chips it shouldn't take long to deliver the product,” he said, advising companies to expect a two-week gap between receipt of the chips and the first product shipments.  The company received 30 chips from BitSynCom late last week, and has been using them to begin testing the Klondike board that was built for it using the reference design produced by BitSynCom for the Avalon chips. This testing should take 2-3 weeks, said Khan.  TerraHash will use the chips and boards to build two modular systems. DX Large is designed to take up to 10 boards, each of which uses 64 chips to produce 18 GH/sec and consumes around 128 W of power.  Also on offer is its smaller brother, the DX Mini, which can contain up to 20 boards, each offering 4.5 GH/sec, for a maximum total of 90 GH/sec. That starts at $1250 for a one board unit including a power supply, and will set you back $6000 for the fully loaded version.  Now that customers are able to preorder for the systems, they will want to know how the company will prioritise them. Khan confirmed that it will fulfill preorders on a strict first-come, first-served, per-order basis. The largest preorder received yesterday was for two fully-loaded DX Large units. An order like this, requiring 1280 chips, would be fulfilled before the next in the queue, even if the next needed only 16 chips to be shipped.  Once the chips arrive, the company should be able to begin producing them relatively quickly. It has its own surface mount technology (SMT) assembly line that can theoretically produce 150 18GH/sec cards per day (although Khan wouldn’t officially commit to that number).  Khan wasn’t worried by allegations on the Bitcoin forums that the firm was operating a scam. Such accusations are levied at many new ventures on the forums, especially ASIC mining rigs, and Butterfly Labs has also been scorched by scam rumours.  “Some people that have been burned in the past, once you get bitten by a snake, you're afraid,” Khan said. “It's their right to question the credibility of a company and we have provided all the information that people have wanted.”  The firm has posted pictures of its physical offices on its blog, along with its address, and asked people to stop by. It has also posted a copy of its Avalon order status screen on the forums.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/19/terrahash-opens-asic-mining-preorders-loses-business,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3b1351b70e70f14ed34b4cec0dc8e74a8cc32209-533x352.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424965,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXIxh,1371626128,IRS targets bitcoin,"Those trading in digital currency in the US will soon be given more guidance on their tax reporting requirements.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has agreed to provide more information on this topic following a report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which highlighted current confusion surrounding digital currencies and tax.  The GAO put the report to the IRS and recommended it find relatively low-cost ways to provide information to taxpayers on the basic tax reporting requirements for virtual currencies.  In a response letter to the GAO, Stephen Miller, deputy commissioner for services and enforcement at the IRS, said: ""The Service is aware of the potential tax compliance risks posed by off-shore and anonymous electronic payment systems and we are working to address these risks.  ""We agree that providing taxpayers with information on the basic tax reporting requirements for transactions involving virtual currencies could further aid our efforts.""  Robert Wood, who practices tax law nationwide with Wood LLP, said: ""I believe the concern is that some are intentionally evading taxes, and that a larger number of people just haven’t thought about it.""  He went on to say that, in his experience, this is true with many barter transactions, too.  ""Many people seem to be surprised when they learn that there could be tax implications,"" added Wood, who is also a writer for Forbes.  He said the big issue centers around how the government will go about identifying and taking action against those avoiding paying tax on digital currency transactions.  ""I think the assumption by many is that these are 100 percent anonymous and that no one can track them. But it seems likely that the IRS will start imposing Form 1099-type obligations, if they already do not apply,"" Wood concluded.  Meanwhile, in the UK, a spokesperson for Her Majesty Revenue and Customs (HMRC), said the department is ""closely monitoring the development"" of the digital currency market.  He went on to say, however, that the tax system already deals with transactions in currencies other than sterling.  If a digital currency, such as bitcoin, is used in the payment of someone who is offering goods or services, that person is classed as a trader, so the profits are taxable.  The spokesperson added that traders would need to convert their profits into sterling before entering them into their UK tax returns.  Also, those who are VAT-registered must remember to charge VAT on any goods and services they supply within the UK.  Both the UK and the US governments are keen to get the word out there that they are aware alternatives to the state currency are being used and are on the rise. The question is, when will tax regulations be altered to give specific mention to digital currency?",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/19/irs-targets-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a137d950b36cb6c55e9b1f39354467f50175d657-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
