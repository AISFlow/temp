Kansler told analysts IHS Markit already has ""tactical partnerships"" with crypto firms like Lukka to source cryptocurrency pricing and reference data. These data points could form the bedrock of a cryptocurrency index product, although Kansler said IHS Markit currently uses them to help clients value portfolios.      ""So it's an area where we’ll continue to focus not just on the valuations side, but probably even moving into the index side in the near future as well,"" he said, referring to cryptocurrencies.      IHS Markit executives acknowledged Wednesday that bitcoin has generational momentum behind it. Chairman and CEO Lance Uggla said the younger ranks of his firm are chomping for more products in the crypto space, even if the firm has ""nothing big and significant"" in the pipeline.      ""Of course, we have every millennial that works for us [thinking] we should have ... major pricing, data services, software and participation around a marketplace that is really legitimizing itself. So we’ve got to take it seriously,"" he said.      IHS Markit is barreling toward a stronger stance in crypto on multiple fronts. In November, it partnered with crypto data firm Lukka to develop crypto data products for Wall Street.

His departure will come a day after the federal banking regulator granted crypto custodian Anchorage a conditional trust charter, making it the first crypto-native national bank.      “It has been a great honor to serve the United States as Acting Comptroller of the Currency,” Brooks said in an emailed statement through a spokesperson. “The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is the most extraordinary of federal agencies filled with the most dedicated, professional and gifted staff any executive can hope to have. I am extremely proud of what we have accomplished together through what have been extraordinary times by any measure.”      Under Brooks, the OCC published a number of interpretative letters surrounding how national banks can interact with the cryptocurrency space, with particular attention paid to stablecoins and their issuers. However, he said during a public seminar hosted by analysis firm Elliptic that much of this work began prior to his arrival at the agency last March.      The former chief legal officer at Coinbase has said multiple times he believes digital assets and blockchain technology can form the basis for the future of the financial system, a view he reiterated during the seminar.      ""Blockchains, fundamentally, are banking because what they’re doing is allowing the transaction of value across networks … they’re doing it in an orthogonally different way,"" he said Wednesday in what may be his swan song in public office.    It is unclear who the incoming president, Joe Biden, might tap to replace Brooks. The OCC announced Chief Operating Officer Blake Paulson will become the new acting comptroller in the interim. Law firm Davis Polk said in a public presentationhttps://www.davispolk.com/sites/default/files/the_road_ahead_for_financial_regulatory_reform_in_a_time_of_democrats_in_control.pdf Wednesday that it is unlikely Brooks' efforts around digital asset custody will be overturned by his successor, though further efforts around digital currencies may be slowed.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/01/13/occ-chief-brian-brooks-is-stepping-down-thursday,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/984531b1a438faf8afa81b566ebfb94da9d3502e-1500x1003.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""The central bank digital currency (CBDC) landscape in free markets is lagging the pace of crypto adoption – it is still unclear how entrenched private cryptos will become before CBDCs become a viable alternative for more efficient transactions,"" the report reads.  ""We think the use cases for private crypto could come to fruition if commerce becomes too accustomed to private crypto use prior to a CBDC alternative launching as a stable, legitimate alternative. And fiat debasing could also in fact help demand stick.""  ""In the interim (1-2 years), absent structural regulatory changes that inhibit its potential utility, we expect private cryptos, particularly those with an upper limit like bitcoin, to continue rising in fiat-equivalent value.""  ""If central banks work expeditiously and deliberately with private partners as we outline above, delivering on reliability, security, and functionality, we think government-promoted CBDCs more likely than not could displace private cryptos (and conventional fiat for that matter) in legitimate commerce, reducing the aggregate demand for private coins, limiting the demand-side factors to 'store-of-value' speculation and illicit dealings.""  China's central bank could launch a digital currency as soon as this year, but the Fed and ECB aren't likely to have their versions ready until at least 2022, according to the report.  ""Central banks face difficult tasks in not just deciding how CBDCs will operate, but also building the infrastructure to get them up and running.""  ""U.S. regulatory officials wield quite a bit of power over how cryptos function and how their ecosystems develop.

42385623,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2SJv,1610573670,The Downside of Crypto Donations,"Cryptocurrency donations are providing a much-needed lifeline to hard-up charities right now. In many countries, the coronavirus pandemic has triggered massive government support packages for businesses disrupted by national lockdowns. Charities have not been so lucky. In the U.K. one in 10 nonprofits face bankruptcy. In the U.S., one in five donors have said they won’t be giving until this is all over.      Innovative, mainly larger charities are tapping into the thousands of new crypto-rich individuals who’ve lately made a mint from bitcoin. Cutting out their usual fundraising middlemen also means donors can be guaranteed the biggest bang for their bitcoin. The Red Cross, UNICEF and Greenpeace, among others, encourage donors to give using crypto rather than cash and frequently advertise the associated tax benefits. Selling bitcoin and donating the after-tax fiat proceeds usually attracts a capital gains levy. By sending crypto directly to charities this is avoided, plus they receive the full value of the contributions.    Pete Howson is a senior lecturer in International Development at the University of Northumbria.    Specialist donation platforms are stepping up to connect crypto donors with the growing number of small charities trying to get in on the bitcoin boom. But for many small charities, and those in need, the benefits come with intolerable levels of surveillance and control.      Even so, some charities are facing a simple choice: fundraise for crypto or go under.      The whistle-blower nonprofit WikiLeaks would probably not exist today without cryptocurrency. In 2010, Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Bank of America and others blockaded WikiLeaks from receiving cash transfers. This was in response to the organization’s publication of classified U.S. State Department cables evidencing U.S. war-crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan.      These actions go to show how money transmitters have no expertize or democratic mandate, yet wield all the power as universal arbiters of morality. Crypto enables charities and businesses to subvert these established power brokers. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has accumulated nearly $1 million worth of crypto since his arrest last April.      As well as disarming the corporations, crypto giving is also challenging government control over good causes. The Tor Project, Sea Shepherd and Greenpeace are often left with frozen bank accounts. The threat of punitive action can change these organizations’ focus. Frequently, they’re forced to rethink the humanitarian or conservation goals expected by their donors and act instead in the interests of local lawmakers, however corrupt they are. This is not so much the case where crypto is on the table.      The corruption issues don’t end with government lawmakers. With traditional project funding, donors usually just have to trust charities to send the funds to wherever it’s promised. These donors might give money conditionally. They might want their funds to cover aid delivery costs and not just everyday overhead, marketing or for covering the CEO’s massive salary. Promises are often broken, though, and with frequent scandals trust in charities globally is dropping. Using blockchain technology, some crypto‐giving platforms promise to empower donors with more control, transparency and security in fundraising and aid provision.      But recent research at the U.K.’s Northumbria University, looking at the technical specs of crypto-giving projects, shows how a shift in power relations promotes “surveillance philanthropy.”      It works like this. Your everyday crypto enthusiast is rarely an expert in the complex realities of disaster relief and humanitarian aid projects. But with crypto giving, donors are able to remove flexibility from the experts while exerting maximum control over the charities’ actions. This, the research suggests, is not only impacting the charity's bottom line but the work it can do.      AidChain, for example, perhaps the starkest example of surveillance philanthropy, has developed the aidcoin token, which it aims to be the preferred global method of charitable giving. Using an Ethereum smart contract, donors can track and manage how funds are spent. AidChain incentivizes charities to pay their service providers in aidcoin in order to improve transparency in the tracking process. So far WWF Italy and several smaller charities have signed up.      Similarly, the Promise crypto‐giving platform empowers donors by validating evidence, provided by any participating charity proving the completion of project milestones, before funds for subsequent phases of a project are released. It has partnered with eight charities – including one of the U.K.’s largest charitable trusts, English Heritage – in addition to collaborating with Charity Checkout, a platform available to 2,000 registered charities.    Crypto enables charities and businesses to subvert these established power brokers.    Promise and AidChain enable donors, who may not be in-the-know about the local realities of those in need, to define what constitutes success and failure for a project. Promise's white paper states, “[I]f a project falters or fails, the funds not yet released can be returned to you as the donor to be donated to a new project”.      Such interventions raise profound questions concerning whether local people or the donor gets to enact their vision of success, and who gets to regulate development projects and how. Donations, though cost‐effective and tax‐efficient for the donor, become highly conditional and inflexible for nonprofits.      Humanity Token adds a further layer of surveillance to the mix. The platform enables donors to restrict those in need from buying anything the donor doesn’t want them to have. Eligible goods and services include, for example, food, shelter, health care and professional courses. Cigarettes and alcohol are going to be off-limits to those who have made the poor life choices that caused their “challenging life conditions.” According to the platform developers’ website, to ensure the poor are behaving in the interest of the donor, they are tracked transparently. Behavior information is then analyzed to provide better support for those who need it.

Meanwhile, a quarter of ether options are expiring in March, meaning traders are making some bets on the first fiscal quarter of 2021.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $36,286 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 5.5% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $32,463-$36,552 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above the 10-hour and 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin was able to recover from a drop in price Wednesday. After going as low as $32,463 around 01:00 UTC (8 p.m. ET Tuesday), it was able to stay in a $34,500-$35,000 range before breaking out to $36,464 before settling at $36,286 as of press time.      Read More: Analysts Are Gloomy About Bitcoin’s Short-Term Price Outlook Right Now      Despite the past few hours of price gains, analysts refer to a day of little price action as a “sideways” or “flat” market. It’s not clear after so much excitement for the world’s oldest cryptocurrency in the first few days of 2021 what might happen next for the price, according to Misha Alefirenko, founder of crypto market maker VelvetFormula.      “I have no clear view at the moment,” Alefirenko told CoinDesk. “Looks like big guys stepped away to wait and see. The market has to find its own balance.”      Bitcoin spot volumes were clearly taking a breather after Monday’s record-high daily zenith of $13.5 billion for the eight exchanges tracked by the CoinDesk 20. For Wednesday, the tally was at $4 billion as of press time, closer to the past month’s $3.8 billion daily spot average.      However, Constantin Kogan, partner at crypto investment firm Wave Financial, has a bearish view of the bitcoin market. “We may go even lower to $23,000,” Kogan said. Because “buy the dip” is a strategy deployed in the crypto market if digital assets start dumping, prices may eventually find their near-term bottom. “There is a zone from which they (traders) will start to actively buy back,” Kogan added.      Read More: Ex-Ripple CTO Can’t Remember Password to Access $240M in Bitcoin      Another chart to note as bitcoin’s price has lifted over 23% so far this year is that of the dollar index (DXY), a measure of the greenback’s strength versus a basket of other fiat currencies. This time last year, the DXY index price was over 97. So far in 2021, it’s struggling to stay above 90.      Wave Financial’s Kogan also noted there has been a closer, albeit opposite, relationship between United States duckets and bitcoin of late. “The decline in bitcoin Monday occurred simultaneously with the strengthening of the dollar index,” he said. “As a result, the two largest currencies – digital and traditional – once again showed an inverse correlation.”    Ether options expirations piling up in March    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Wednesday, trading around $1,110 and climbing 2.5% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The amount of open interest in ether options is heavily favoring the March 21 expiration. That is where 25% of current options open interest are to be found, according to data from aggregator Skew.      “Mostly it's rolling,” said Vishal Shah, founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, referring to a strategy where traders “roll up” to a higher strike price. And while most strikes are favoring a sub-$800 spot price, the majority of the trades for Wednesday were calls (62%) versus puts (39%).      Shah told CoinDesk the March 21 expiration date pile-up correlates nicely with the end of the fiscal quarter and may explain why it’s taking the lion’s share of ether options open interest. “Quarterly expirations are typically larger than monthly, and March is now the nearest quarterly expiry,” he said.

42385608,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2S13,1610567713,FinCEN's Crypto Surveillance Rule Violates the US Constitution,"In the late afternoon on the Friday before Christmas, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) proposed a regulation introducing data collection and reporting requirements for cryptocurrency. FinCEN gave the public only 15 days to comment, over the holidays, instead of the usual 60 days. This was a clear attempt to push through a midnight regulation without giving the public time to respond, and it backfired. Despite the short timeline, roughly 7,500 people and entities submitted comments decrying the proposal, the most FinCEN has received on any proposed rulemaking. The comments on this proposal constitute nearly 70% of all comments FinCEN has received on all rule-makings since 2008 combined.    Marta Belcher, a cryptocurrency and civil liberties attorney, is special counsel to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, general counsel to Protocol Labs and an attorney at Ropes & Gray. She is also Board Chair of the Filecoin Foundation and the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web. Her views are her own.    So many people spoke up about this proposed regulation because it is a blatant violation of civil liberties. The proposal would require certain businesses like cryptocurrency exchanges to collect identity data not just about their own customers but also about non-customers who transact with their customers, and to keep that data and hand it over to the federal government when the transactions exceed a certain amount. This would give the government access to troves of sensitive financial data, going well beyond FinCEN’s requirements for non-cryptocurrency transactions.      In addition, the regulation would give the government far more data than what the regulation itself even contemplates. The proposed regulation would give the government the identities associated with cryptocurrency wallet addresses. Because of the nature of public blockchains, that means the government would know the identity associated with all transactions for those wallet addresses, even when the amounts of those transactions are far below the reporting threshold.      In the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s comment on FinCEN’s proposal, Rainey Reitman, Danny O’Brien, Aaron Mackey and I argue that the proposed regulation violates the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.      See also: JP Koning - FinCEN’s Crypto Rules Aren’t as Unfair as Jack Dorsey Says      The Fourth Amendment requires that law enforcement obtain a warrant supported by probable cause before conducting a search or seizure. So why is it that, in the traditional financial system, law enforcement can engage in mass surveillance of bank customers without a warrant? The answer is the third-party doctrine – the idea that people do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the data that they share with a third party like a bank. In 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court held in U.S. v. Miller that the Bank Secrecy Act (as it was implemented at the time) did not violate the Fourth Amendment because of this third-party doctrine.      But I believe the Court would come to a different decision if faced with FinCEN’s proposed regulation – or, indeed, the mass surveillance that we have come to accept as normal in today’s banking system. Even in the 1970s, the Supreme Court justice who authored Miller wrote in another case that “financial transactions can reveal much about a person's activities, associations and beliefs. At some point, governmental intrusion upon these areas would implicate legitimate expectations of privacy.” Since Miller, the government has greatly expanded the Bank Secrecy Act’s reach – and the 1976 decision was an as-applied challenge of the law as it was implemented at the time. FinCEN’s proposed regulation goes even beyond FinCEN’s other activities in non-cryptocurrency contexts.      More important, in the decades since Miller, the Supreme Court has issued strong pro-privacy opinions in multiple cases, chipping away at the third-party doctrine in the context of the digital world. For example, it held in Carpenter v. U.S. that law enforcement must have a warrant to obtain location information from a cell phone company. The information that could be gleaned from bank data in the 1970s is a world away from the detailed picture of a person’s life that can be painted with access to digital financial transactions today.      Our financial transactions provide an intimate window into our lives – what organizations we donate to, what books and products we buy, who we support and even where we go. Recent images from the Hong Kong protests show pro-democracy protesters waiting in long lines at subway stations to purchase tickets with cash so their electronic purchases would not place them at the scene of the protest. These photos underscore the importance of financial privacy, and why we must protect our Fourth Amendment rights in the context of financial transactions.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | FIL | REGULATION,Marta Belcher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/01/13/fincens-crypto-surveillance-rule-violates-the-us-constitution,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29a1248e23fe9be61eea964225b8f36d8269ba9e-1500x915.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385618,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2SEt,1610566498,Anchorage Becomes First OCC-Approved National Crypto Bank,"Crypto custodian Anchorage has secured conditional approval for a national trust charter from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), making it the first national “digital asset bank” in the U.S.      The safekeeping, management and trading of digital assets have been regulatory stumbling blocks for large financial institutions – but those obstacles are gradually being removed. The OCC, a part of the Treasury Department charged with keeping banks safe but also competitive, has now issued three interpretative letters that lay the groundwork for banks to custody crypto, participate in blockchain networks and become payment providers using the tech.      ""In granting this charter, the OCC applied the same rigorous review and standards applied to all charter applications,"" the bank regulator said in a statement. ""By bringing this applicant into the federal banking system, the bank and industry will benefit from the OCC’s extensive supervisory experience and expertise.""      “We are a national bank. The only difference is our business line, that we’re doing crypto assets versus doing other assets,” Anchorage President Diogo Mónica said in an interview. “The benefit of having a federally chartered bank is that it preempts all the state laws. The clarity of being regulated by the oldest regulator for banks in the United States … sends a very clear message.”      Acting OCC chief Brian Brooks, speaking at a public event earlier Wednesday, expressed his belief that banks and financial services more broadly will transition to being blockchain-based.      “I think what’s necessary is the creation of crypto banks that are able to hold stablecoins that reflect value of a fiat currency, but that doesn’t change the native asset, and you need to have real cryptocurrencies over here where they interact directly with each other, with no need to ever off-ramp,” Brooks said. “Fiat will ultimately be a legacy thing of the past.”    Application process    Anchorage’s trust company unit first applied for a national charter from the OCC last November, and it joins Kraken and Avanti in being crypto-native banks, although the latter two are special-purpose depository institutions organized under Wyoming state law. Fellow crypto startups BitPay and Paxos have also applied for federal charters through the OCC.      The new bank is being ushered in under the auspices of Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks, who’s headed up the regulator since this past summer. It’s the capstone to a multi-month effort to bring the crypto industry closer to the traditional banking world.    Read more: Crypto Markets Jump on OCC Approval for Banks to Use Blockchains    “Blockchains, fundamentally, are banking because what they’re doing is allowing the transaction of value across networks,” Brooks said at Wednesday’s event. “They’re [just] doing it in an orthogonally different way.”      During his tenure, Brooks, the former general counsel of Coinbase, has expressed his view that crypto startups may be better regulated under a federal framework, rather than at the state level.      “We’ve had a dual banking system in this country for 150 years. There are many, many banks chartered by the states out there because it's the right business model for what they're focused on,” Brooks told CoinDesk in June. “If you’re focused on the local and regional business, it makes sense to have a state charter. If you’re focused on a national business, it probably makes more sense to have a national charter.”      Georgia Quinn, Anchorage’s general counsel, told CoinDesk the process of applying for a national charter was made easier by the fact that the startup was already operating as a registered trust company in South Dakota.      “We were already a state-chartered bank and so already had an operating history and a lot of the relevant procedures and policies in place so it wasn’t a de novo application, it was just the conversion of a state trust into a national trust,” she said. “I really can’t stress enough the advantage we had from already operating as a trust company.”    Benefits    Granting crypto companies a bank charter has been a stated goal for Brooks since May, when the then–First Deputy Comptroller told an audience at CoinDesk’s Consensus: Distributed that in his view, “it looks a lot like crypto is banking for the 21st century.”      The advantages are clear: rather than require companies to apply for 49 state money transmitter licenses piecemeal, a national charter will allow businesses to operate throughout the country at once.      It also lets Anchorage develop new services, Mónica and co-founder Nathan McCauley told CoinDesk.      “It means that there’s a crypto-native company that offers crypto services like lending, staking and now it’s allowed to actually be connected directly to the core of the financial system,” Mónica said. “We can go out and do all sorts of businesses, wrapped assets that financial institutions can do today, but backed by crypto assets.”      Anchorage stated in a blog post accompanying the announcement that its new federally chartered bank “unequivocally will meet the definition of Qualified Custodian.”      Qualified custodians are legal entities in the U.S. that maintain client funds and hold securities in specific, defined ways. Federal regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) can designate entities as qualified custodians, while state regulators cannot.      Crypto companies have long had issues becoming qualified custodians, due to questions about how digital asset service providers can comply with aspects of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 – specifically, how brokers can prove that no other entity has access to its own private keys.      Mónica said any doubts around the management of cryptographic keys were now removed and this would pave the way for the largest, most risk-averse investors such as pension funds to enter the arena.      “Aside from crypto funds and hedge funds and VCs that are paid to take risk and to be on the bleeding edge, you have large institutions that are paid not to take risk,” Mónica said. “This means all of the doubts are now solved and in black and white.”      Kristin Smith, executive director of lobbying group the Blockchain Association, welcomed the news.      “Today’s announcement is a recognition that not only can banks engage with crypto, but that crypto companies can function as banks,” Smith said in a statement. “This is the most important step yet towards the full modernization of our financial services system.”    Out the door    The news comes as Brooks is rumored to be planning his departure from the federal regulator later this week. While Brooks has been nominated to serve a full term heading up the agency by President Donald Trump, it is expected that incoming President Joe Biden will pull the nomination.      There is already legislator pushback against many of the letters Brooks has overseen, with Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the chair of the House Financial Services Committee, asking Biden to ensure his nominees revoke many Trump-era rules and regulations, including all of the OCC’s recent crypto guidance.      A federal charter is one issue that would be more difficult for Brooks’ successor to overturn.    Read more: How the OCC Is Building Crypto America (and Saving Banks From Extinction)    It’s unclear who Biden will tap to lead the OCC. The President-elect has announced he will nominate former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to be Treasury Secretary. The Senate Finance Committee will hold a confirmation hearing for her on Jan. 19, a day before Biden is sworn in.      Yellen or Biden could designate an acting comptroller to lead the agency until someone is nominated to fill a full five-year term. Brooks was initially appointed to the OCC by current Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.      Biden has reportedly nominated former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Gary Gensler to lead the SEC, perhaps indicating that he may look for someone with less of a deregulatory focus.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,"Nikhilesh De, Ian Allison",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/01/13/anchorage-becomes-first-occ-approved-national-crypto-bank,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e96e8d62c40180a34e4068afdfd7e4fd24ffa59-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385625,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2SLB,1610563012,Trading Hall of Fame: The Bitcoin Options Bet That Made $58.2M Profit on Just $638K,"With a 9,118% return on investment, a bitcoin options trade initiated in late October is trouncing some of the best currency market bets of the past 40 years by leaps and bounds.      On Oct. 30, someone (a single trader or small group) bought 16,000 contracts of Jan. 29 expiry call options at the $36,000 strike for 0.003 bitcoin per contract, according to data shared by Deribit. The initial investment or total purchase cost was 48 BTC, or roughly $638,400 as per bitcoin's price back then.      At press time, the $36,000 call option is drawing a price of 0.1060 bitcoin on Deribit. At current prices, which haven't changed much in the past 24 hours, and assuming the position is still active, the trader appears to be sitting on a gain of 1,648 bitcoin or $58.2 million.      Here is how we arrive at the net return:    = [(Option's current price of 0.1060 BTC x 16,000 contracts) x bitcoin's current spot market price of $34,700] minus (-) cost of trade.= [1,696 bitcoin x $34,700] - $638,400= $58,851,200 - $638,400= $58,212,800    That's a 9,118% return on investment. The trader would have made significantly less money in the spot market because bitcoin is currently up over 150% from the Oct. 30 average of around $13,700.    The trade in context with other famous wins    The staggering four-digit return is far greater than what veteran trader George Soros' reportedly earned in September 1992 when he shorted the British pound. As recalled in Investopedia, Soros took a short position worth $10 billion and made $1 billion as the pound plunged 15% versus the German mark and 25% against the U.S. dollar.    There were others, of course. The 86% return generated by trader Louis Baconhttps://synapsetrading.com/2017/04/the-worlds-7-greatest-currency-trades-ever-made-key-lessons-insights/ in the 1990s by buying oil and selling stocks in anticipation of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait also looks meager compared to the 9,118% gain generated by the bitcoin options trade. As such, one may feel tempted to call the bitcoin options trade one of the most epic bets of all time. However, traditional market veterans suggest otherwise.    ""Interesting [trade], but tough to know really about trade success ... [W]inning a lottery ticket is a great return on investment, too,"" Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, told CoinDesk in an email. Chandler has 30 years of experience working in the global capital markets and is the author of the book ""Making Sense of the Dollar.""      Chandler's lottery analogy makes sense because back in October the $36,000 call was deep out-of-the-money (spot price trading well below the strike price) and was trading at a marginal premium of 0.003 bitcoin.      When a trader buys options, be it call or put, the maximum loss is limited to the extent of the initial price (premium) paid, and maximum profit is unlimited. That's because, theoretically, the sky's the limit for any asset's price. Hence, buying cheap out-of-the-money options is akin to buying a lottery ticket.      That does not necessarily mean the options trader merely gambled with 48 BTC, or $683,000, by taking a long position in the $36,000 call in October.      The fact that the position remained active well after the cryptocurrency set new record highs above the December 2017 high of $19,783 in mid-December indicates the trader was expecting a meteoric rise. Amateur traders gambling with deep OTM options usually take profits quickly.      ""This trade may be added to the trading legends in the crypto space, like the guy who bought a pizza [with] bitcoin back when,"" Chandler quipped.      Also, this trade can't be compared to some of the best traditional market trades, given that the currency/commodity/equity markets are way bigger in terms of market capitalization and trading volumes than the entire cryptocurrency market.      ""Despite all the furor, I personally still see bitcoin as a very niched, highly speculative and illiquid market. Even if the liquidity is better than it used to be, I don't see it as FX at all,"" Marc Ostwald, chief economist at London-based ADM Investor Services, said.    Profit booked on Tuesday?    Open interest, or the number of open positions, in the $36,000 call expiring on Jan. 29 fell by 9,500 to 5,000 on Tuesday.      According to some observers, the sharp decline has resulted from the unwinding of the long trade taken in October. ""This is presumably from our whale friend who had bought them back"" in October-November, Swiss-based data analytics platform Laevitas tweeted early Wednesday while taking note of the drop in the open interest.      Bitcoin hasn't moved much in the past 24 hours. Thus, we can assume the trader cashed out with a return of around 9,000% on Tuesday.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/13/trading-hall-of-fame-the-bitcoin-options-bet-that-made-582m-profit-on-just-638k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf8660344b79a5c234f56f73c06e9f51f687fa41-1920x1277.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Multiple DeFi tokens this week saw double-digit gains, including 0x (ZRX), aave (AAVE), and maker (MKR). Prices for 0x were at $0.52 at the time of writing, up 20.42% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk 20. Maker’s price, at the same time, saw near-160% growth year to date.      “I think the biggest thing is bitcoin’s momentum finally cooling and giving DeFi tokens some room to breathe,” Ryan Watkins, research analyst at Messari, told CoinDesk. “On top of that there are a lot of exciting new releases coming out in DeFi these next one to two weeks which is creating momentum as well.”      0x, an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange, announced its version 4 upgrade plan on Jan. 7, which caused a sudden rally in the protocol’s ZRX token. The upgrade will include new customizable modules that are able to execute trades without interruption and gas efficiency optimization. The vote for the upgrade is scheduled for Jan. 16.      Trading volumes on major decentralized exchanges also saw rapid growth in the past month, up 95% to approximately $37.58 billion, according to data from Dune Analytics. On derivatives exchange FTX, perpetual futures for their DeFi index were also trading near their all-time high again as of press time.      However, this time is unlike the last “alt season” that appeared temporarily after bitcoin’s bull run in 2017 or the ""DeFi summer"" boom, which was caused by ""hype"" on high yields from liquidity mining, according to Peter Chan, lead trader for crypto trading firm OneBit Quant. He told CoinDesk he does not see any new exciting projects that are attracting particular liquidity to altcoins.

Arxnovum Investments’ bitcoin ETF could conceivably trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, if approved. U.S. regulators have long been skeptical of these “high risk” investment vehicles, which many point to as hampering institutional interest (by the way, check out Blockwork’s new editorial site).      Stopping bitcoin ‘funny business’... European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde has called for bitcoin to be regulated at the international level, during a Reuters event. The “highly speculative asset” has led to ""some reprehensible activity,"" including money laundering, and any loopholes need to be closed, according to a report from Reuters. Meanwhile, crypto’s favorite regulator, Brian Brooks, the acting head of the U.S.’ top bank regulatory agency, is reportedly ending his term this week, while crypto-knowledgeable Wall Street and Commodity Futures Trading Commission vet Gary Gensler is rumored to be named chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commision.      Gloomy projections? Analysts are gloomy about bitcoin’s short-term price outlook, with several pointing to increased flows onto exchanges and cooling institutional demand. Some 57,000 BTC moved onto exchanges Tuesday, the biggest-single day change since the markets crash on March 12, 2020. A Goldman Sachs exec said institutional investors are “key” to curbing bitcoin’s volatility. Neither bitcoin’s 20% drop on Monday, nor its volatility, have stopped “whales” from buying the dip.

Bitcoin and ether prices are about 87% and 78%, respectively, of their all-time highs, though the majority of altcoins (smaller market cap cryptocurrencies) are languishing. While some altcoins have spiked during the recent market run-up, retail investors have largely ignored these cheaper, and riskier, cryptos. That said, Messari found tokens embedded in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market – like maker (MKR), compound (COMP), aave (AAVE) and uniswap (UNI) – are seeing robust growth.    At stake    Inflation projections Much of bitcoin’s growth in 2020 was driven by institutional investors turning to the hard-capped, deflationary asset as an inflation hedge. Hedge fund legend Paul Tudor Jones, MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor and Guggenheim Partners Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd, among others, have all spoken on bitcoin’s prospect as “digital gold.”      Fiscal stimulus and looser monetary policy in response to the coronavirus pandemic drove up inflation projections. Indeed, rates for U.S. Treasury bonds have been ticking up higher in recent days, crossing 1% last week, on calls for additional government spending – such as President-elect Joe Biden’s plan to inject “trillions of dollars” through an economic recovery package.      But the line of sight on inflation is anything but clear. The U.S. Labor Department reported today that a key measure of inflation, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), only increased 1.4% in 2020, the smallest yearly gain since 2015. For reference, 2019’s CPI rose 2.3%, while the 10-year average is estimated at 1.7%.      This is far below the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation target. Last year, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled it would reverse course and allow the economy to run hot – above 2% – for periods, acknowledging the economy has missed this target for the last decade. Some investors and analysts are skeptical of any forthcoming change. Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics, for one, is quoted in Barron's casting doubt on the prospect of a rate increase before 2024.      Bloomberg urged readers to “Get Ready for the Great U.S. Inflation Mirage of 2021,” with economists Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva quoted as saying, “2021 will be a year plagued by numerous unwarranted inflation scares. Consumer inflation will remain weak over the medium term -- until the economy fully absorbs the slack resulting from the pandemic.”      Still, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Wednesday that inflation is likely to rise. Speaking at a Reuters conference, Bullard said the “money supply has ‘exploded,’ fiscal deficits are ‘off the charts’ and a hot economy may either already be here or ‘just around the corner,’” according to a Reuters report.      Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, told CoinDesk over email he projects “a clear uplift to 2.5%-plus in Q2.” Though, “the key question of what happens when the economy reopens fully remains unanswerable at this point.”      So what does this mean for bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market table?      Well, unlike highly liquid and tradable assets like U.S. Treasury bonds that reflect any minute change in inflation projections, bitcoin often does its own thing.      Correlated with stocks and other traditional assets, bitcoin has largely followed the herd in price swings, although in a bull market, with the highest volatility in three years, anything is possible. On Monday, bitcoin shed 20% only to bounce back. And while analysts have grim short-term outlooks, many are convinced there’s still money sitting on the sidelines.      “Recent institutional investors have long horizons and will absorb near-term price shocks,” while retail investors would buy at discounted price levels for fear of missing out, Jehan Chu, managing partner at Hong Kong-based Kenetic Capital, told CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole. “Expect temporary volatility and then a jump back to the $40,000 level, followed by $50,000 as the bitcoin percentage land grab continues.”    Who won #CryptoTwitter?",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/13/blockchain-bites-bitcoin-trades-sideways-as-us-inflation-is-muted,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2cd702a5ca08fc7529c5df8f0996bbfd46d83f7f-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385615,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2SB7,1610559959,La carrera de Colombia por convertirse en un mercado líder de criptomonedas en la región,"En marzo de 2020 un colombiano de 23 años, conocido bajo el seudónimo de Atlas, comenzó a adquirir bitcoin.      Por ese entonces, bitcoin estaba valuado en aproximadamente USD 4500, todavía en los estadios tempranos de lo que sería una histórica alza en su precio.    Read this article in English.    “Realmente no sabía cómo afrontar esa situación. Una persona como yo, que nunca había tenido más de USD 2000 en mi vida”, dijo a CoinDesk Atlas, quien prefiere mantener su anonimato por el momento.      Mientras el precio continuaba subiendo, explicó Atlas, su padre, quien no salía de su asombro, lo instó a vender. Atlas esperó y dijo que se las ingenió para convencer a por lo menos ocho de sus amigos para que también invirtieran en bitcoin. Después de que la criptomoneda superó los USD 30.000, Atlas comenzó el proceso para obtener una hipoteca de la casa familiar con el objetivo de comprar más bitcoin.      “Para ser honesto, he estado recibiendo mensajes de texto de gente joven casi a diario. Y estos jóvenes hablan con otros jóvenes”, dijo Atlas. (CoinDesk no pudo verificar independientemente esta información).      Durante el año 2020, Colombia experimentó un gran incremento del uso de criptomonedas como reserva de valor y con fines transaccionales, con crecimientos récord en las plataformas de préstamos de persona a persona (P2P) y plataformas de intercambio (exchanges). LocalBitcoins reportó que ese país representó el 11.3% de su volumen global en 2020, convirtiéndolo en uno de sus mercados principales junto con Rusia y Venezuela. En Buda.com, uno de los más grandes exchanges de América Latina, los volúmenes de transacciones en Colombia crecieron un 350% entre 2019 y 2020, mientras que los usuarios activos en la plataforma aumentaron un 125% llegando a los 16.092, de acuerdo con la información provista por ese exchange.    El efecto de la pandemia    Los primeros meses de 2020 no fueron buenos para Atlas. Cuando comenzó el año tenía un puesto laboral en el cual obtenía el salario mínimo, cobrando menos de USD 300 al mes. Nos contó que, a raíz de su participación en una pelea en la vía pública de la ciudad en la que vive, terminó en la cárcel por algunas semanas. Cuando fue liberado, la pandemia provocada por el COVID-19 azotó a toda la región, dejando a su familia en la indigencia.      “No teníamos absolutamente nada de dinero, ni energía ni gas. Hacíamos sándwiches con un quemador de alcohol”, contó Atlas.      La pandemia golpeó fuertemente a América Latina. Solo en Colombia se registraron cerca de 1.4 millones de casos, ubicando al país cuarto en el ranking de cantidad de muertes dentro de la región, solo por debajo de Brasil, México y Argentina. Muchas monedas locales dentro de América Latina se devaluaron frente al dólar estadounidense como consecuencia del deterioro de sus economías.      Leer Más al Respecto: Los argentinos están cambiando su obsesión histórica con el dólar por DAI      Mientras tanto, las criptomonedas tuvieron un año exitoso en América Latina. Los argentinos incrementaron la demanda de ellas en 2020 en su esfuerzo por encontrar monedas más fuertes como reserva de valor a fin de proteger sus patrimonios frente a la devaluación del peso. México y Venezuela las utilizan cada vez más a fin de procesar remesas transfronterizas.      Si bien la pandemia provocada por el coronavirus parecería haber impulsado bitcoin en Colombia, se advierte que los colombianos ya mostraban interés por las criptomonedas mucho antes del comienzo del coronavirus.      “No atribuiría el boom de las criptomonedas en el país solamente al declive económico temporal provocado por la pandemia”, expresó Magdiela Rivas, manager de Paxful en América Latina, mediante un correo electrónico enviado a CoinDesk.      De acuerdo con los dichos de Rivas, antes de la crisis económica global de 2020, el interés de Colombia por las criptomonedas ya crecía fuertemente en medio de un alza en su economía interna. Según un reporte del Banco Mundial, luego de que su crecimiento se desplomara al 1.1% en 2017, Colombia se recuperó rápidamente y registró una tasa acelerada de crecimiento del 3.3% en 2019. Aunque la economía se vio gravemente afectada durante la pandemia, el mismo informe reporta que el país “respondió rápidamente a la crisis y tomó medidas decisivas para proteger las vidas y las fuentes de sustento, así como también para apoyar la economía”.      “Continuó siendo uno de los países más estables de la región a pesar de la pandemia”, dijo Rivas.      Según Coin ATM Radar, Colombia también cuenta con la mayor cantidad de cajeros automáticos de bitcoin en América Latina. El país tiene 59 en total, 33 de los cuales se encuentran en Bogotá, su capital. En contraposición, Panamá solo posee 17 cajeros automáticos de bitcoin, número que lo ubica como el segundo país con mayor cantidad en la región.      Colombia ya se encontraba incorporando ampliamente la tecnología fintech desde antes de la pandemia. Medios locales reportaron que en 2019 el país contaba con 180 compañías en ese sector, un 45% más que el año anterior.      En septiembre de 2020, la Superintendencia Financiera de Colombia (SFC), autoridad encargada de supervisar la integridad y transparencia de los mercados de valores, anunció un sandbox regulatorio (NdT: el término, que en español significa “arenero” o “banco de pruebas”, describe al campo de pruebas de nuevos modelos de negocio que aún no están protegidos por una regulación vigente) a fin de que los emprendimientos dedicados a criptomonedas pudieran testear transacciones. Las compañías que aspiraran a participar en dicho programa de sandbox podían aplicar a este hasta el 31 de diciembre. El programa fue diseñado para “promover un espacio conjunto de experimentación entre el ecosistema digital y el Gobierno Nacional con relación a cripto activos”.    Regulación    Al día de la fecha, el marco regulatorio aplicable al segmento de monedas digitales en Colombia continúa indefinido. En 2014, la SFC emitió una circular estableciendo que bitcoin no es un activo que tenga equivalencia a la moneda de curso legal en Colombia. En esa misma circular, la SFC prohibió a las entidades que vigila —incluidos los bancos— custodiar, invertir o intermediar con monedas digitales. En 2017 la misma autoridad lanzó otra advertencia: “Las operaciones que involucren ‘monedas virtuales’ no se encuentran amparadas por ningún tipo de garantía privada o estatal”.      Tras las advertencias publicadas por las autoridades, en 2018 medios locales reportaron que ciertas instituciones bancarias habían cerrado cuentas pertenecientes a la plataforma de intercambio Buda.com. Alejandro Beltrán, country manager de Buda.com, le confirmó a CoinDesk que en enero el exchange colaboró con las asociaciones locales de fintech y blockchain para pedirle al presidente de Colombia, Iván Duque Márquez, que permitiera la reapertura de cuentas y de operaciones de ese exchange.      “Pero el presidente no pudo ayudarnos de manera directa y en cambio nos derivó con el Ministerio de Economía”, dijo Beltrán.      De acuerdo con Beltrán, Buda.com luego intentó tomar acciones legales contra la autoridad financiera, con el objetivo de clarificar si los bancos estaban habilitados para operar cuentas asociadas con compañías pertenecientes al sector de las criptomonedas. Finalmente, obtuvieron una respuesta de parte de las autoridades financieras afirmando que la ley no les impide a los bancos proveer servicios a compañías pertenecientes al sector cripto.      “La respuesta del supervisor financiero fue que ellos no prohíben la relación entre bancos y exchanges que operan con criptomonedas, pero que existen restricciones respecto del uso interno de criptomonedas en los bancos”, dijo Beltrán.      En Colombia las monedas digitales son catalogadas como propiedad personal y no están sujetas al cobro del Impuesto al Valor Agregado (IVA).      Más allá de eso, y salvo contadas excepciones, no hay suficiente claridad respecto de la política normativa aplicable vigente.      Por ejemplo, en diciembre del 2020 la Superintendencia de Sociedades declaró que las compañías que operen en el país tienen permitido convertir capital a bitcoin siempre y cuando lo hagan en cumplimiento de las regulaciones locales aplicables a las criptomonedas.      Beltrán sugirió que la falta de claridad normativa puede haber dado lugar a la creación de un gran mercado informal para la compra y venta de criptomonedas.    Bitcoin en descuento    De acuerdo a Rivas, de Paxful, los colombianos tienen la posibilidad de adquirir bitcoin localmente a precios relativamente competitivos, generando así un mercado interno extremadamente activo y una gran demanda de criptomonedas.      “Básicamente, tienen la oportunidad de adquirir bitcoin a un precio menor y venderlo en cualquier otro lugar al valor de mercado o a uno mayor, lo cual les permite a los colombianos percibir un gran beneficio económico a través de las ganancias generadas en el arbitraje”, dijo Rivas.      Beltrán confirmó que bitcoin efectivamente puede ser adquirido localmente a un precio menor a través del mercado informal, lo cual es posible que se origine porque el dólar estadounidense se vende en mercados paralelos a un precio entre 6% y 8% menor que el de las cotizaciones oficiales.      Atlas también confirmó que, a pesar de que algunos exchanges importantes como Buda.com operan en el país, algunas personas eligen transaccionar por fuera de las plataformas a través de las redes sociales.      “La gente tiene grupos de chats en Telegram, Whatsapp, Facebook, más del tipo de persona a persona (P2P)”, sostuvo Atlas.      Beltrán confirmó lo anterior, agregando que Colombia procesa un considerable volumen de remesas cada año —la mayoría destinadas a su país vecino Venezuela— y que los precios competitivos de bitcoin también puede ser que provengan de dichos mercados de remesas.    Migración    La Organización de las Naciones Unidas (ONU) informó que hasta el 30 de junio de 2019 había 1.4 millones de inmigrantes venezolanos residiendo en Colombia tras dejar su país por la inestabilidad económica y política.      De acuerdo con Beltrán, enviar dinero fuera de Colombia puede ser engorroso. Las dificultades surgen principalmente por las estrictas medidas tomadas contra el lavado de dinero que buscan controlar los movimientos de los carteles de droga desde y hacia Colombia. En un informe del 2020, el Departamento de Estado de los Estados Unidos nombró a Colombia como una de las principales jurisdicciones del mundo en materia de blanqueo de dinero.      “Tus operaciones son 100% offline, tu dinero tarda entre dos y cinco días en llegar a destino. Y, bueno, cuando ves las limitaciones que tenemos aquí, debido a las restricciones financieras impuestas por los bancos, te das cuenta de que bitcoin está funcionando no sólo para las remesas sino también para el comercio electrónico"", afirmó Beltrán.      Leer Más al Respecto: Las criptomonedas crecen en la problemática economía de Argentina      En 2018, un usuario bajo el nombre de Joshua Nix escribió en un foro público acerca de las dificultades existentes para las transacciones transfronterizas en Colombia.      “[Yo] solía comprar bitcoin a un vendedor en Colombia hasta a un 10% más barato que el precio de mercado. De esta forma, en vez de pagar cerca del 10% a Western Union en concepto de honorarios y obtener un pésimo tipo de cambio, lograba generar yo mismo una ganancia de cerca del 10%”, dijo Nix.      Por su parte, Atlas ve a bitcoin como una inversión a largo plazo y un posible camino hacia una vida mejor. Dijo que ha mantenido sus ahorros iniciales en bitcoin, y explicó que su decisión de hacerlo se debió parcialmente a lo que en Twitter se conoce como la “cultura americana del hodl”. Hodl se refiere a una jerga entre inversores de activos digitales orientada a mantenerlos a largo plazo en lugar de revenderlos.      “Todavía trabajo. Todavía uso harapos. Aún no tengo una chica. Básicamente, todavía soy un perdedor. Y estoy bien con eso. Simplemente quiero lograr alcanzar un mejor nivel de vida. Deseo poder sacar a mi familia de aquí”, dijo.      Atlas, quien ha perdido a algunos de sus amigos en hechos de violencia, dijo que se libró fácilmente de su corta estadía en la cárcel. Pero cree que su decisión de invertir en bitcoin y su éxito hasta el momento lo han cambiado, le han brindado confianza necesaria para mejorar su vida. Está aprendiendo a programar y tiene planes de comprar una laptop para poder seguir haciéndolo. Su fe en el futuro de bitcoin es tan grande que le ha dicho a su familia que, dado que ya son pobres, un año más de espera no hará la diferencia si bitcoin tiene el potencial de alcanzar los $100,000.      “Es así: o la hacemos en grande o nos quedamos donde estamos. No hay término medio"", dijo Atlas.

42385617,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2SDd,1610559937,'No Middle Ground': Inside Colombia's Race to Become A Major Regional Crypto Market,"In March 2020, a 23-year-old Colombian going by Atlas started buying bitcoin.      At the time, bitcoin was valued at around $4,500, still in the nascent stages of what would become a historic price run.    Lea este artículo en español.    “I really didn’t know how to approach the situation. A person like me, I never had more than $2,000 in my life,” Atlas, who spoke on condition of pseudonymity, told CoinDesk.      As the price kept going up, Atlas said, his surprised father urged him to sell. Atlas held on and said he has managed to convince at least eight friends to invest in bitcoin as well. After the currency began trading above $30,000, Atlas started the process of taking out a mortgage on his family home to buy more.      “I've been getting texts almost daily from young people, to be honest. And those young people talk to other young people,” Atlas said. (CoinDesk was not able to independently verify these details.)      Colombia saw a major boost in crypto use as a store of wealth as well as for transactional purposes in 2020, with peer-to-peer lending platforms and exchanges recording historic growth. LocalBitcoins reported that Colombia accounted for 11.3% of its global volume in 2020, making it one of the firm’s “main markets” alongside Russia and Venezuela. Transaction volumes on Buda.com, one of Latin America's largest crypto exchanges, grew by 350% between 2019 and 2020 in Colombia, with active users on the platform increasing by 125% to 16,092 according to data provided by the exchange.    The pandemic’s effect    The first months of 2020 did not go well for Atlas. When the year started, he was working a minimum wage job, making less than $300 a month. He said that after getting into a fight in a public space in his hometown, he ended up in jail for a few weeks. Around the time he was released, the COVID-19 pandemic swept through the region, leaving his family destitute.      “We had absolutely no money, no power and no gas. We were making sandwiches with an alcohol burner,” Atlas said.      The pandemic hit Latin America hard, with Colombia alone recording over 1.4 million cases and placing it fourth highest in deaths behind Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Many local currencies in the region fell against the U.S. dollar as economies suffered.      Read more: Why Argentines Are Turning From Dollars to Stablecoins Like Dai      Meanwhile, crypto had a successful year in Latin America. Argentinians drove up the demand for cryptocurrencies in 2020 as they struggled to find stronger currencies to store their wealth due to the devaluation of the peso. Mexico and Venezuela increasingly used crypto to process cross-border remittances.      While the coronavirus pandemic may have boosted bitcoin in Colombia, it seems Colombians were showing interest in crypto long before the outbreak.      “I wouldn’t attribute the crypto boom in the country just to the pandemic causing a temporary economic decline,” Magdiela Rivas, Paxful’s Latin America manager, told CoinDesk via email.      According to Rivas, before the 2020 global economic crisis Colombia’s interest in crypto was growing fast while the country’s economy was also on the rise, Rivas said. After growth slumped to 1.1% in 2017, Colombia recovered quickly and recorded an accelerated growth rate of 3.3% in 2019, according to a World Bank report. Although the economy was hit badly during the pandemic, the same report said the country “responded promptly to the crisis and took decisive actions to protect lives and livelihood, and to support the economy.”      “It remained one of the most stable countries in the region despite the pandemic,” Rivas said.      Colombia also boasts the highest number of bitcoin ATMs in a Latin American country, according to Coin ATM Radar. The country has 59 bitcoin ATMs and tellers, with 33 in Bogota, the capital, alone. In contrast, Panama has only 17 bitcoin ATMs, the second-largest number in the region.      Colombia was embracing fintech more broadly before the pandemic. Local media reported that in 2019 Colombia had 180 fintech companies, up 45% from the previous year.      In September 2020, the country’s financial watchdog, SFC, announced a regulatory sandbox for crypto startups to test transactions. Firms could apply to participate in the sandbox through Dec. 31. The program was designed to “promote a joint test space between the digital ecosystem and the National Government in terms of crypto assets.”    Regulation    Today, how Colombia regulates crypto remains unclear. In 2014, the SFC published guidance declaring bitcoin was not recognized as a currency and was not legal tender in Colombia. In the same statement, the SFC barred banks from dealing in virtual currencies. In 2017, the organization published another statement warning, “Operations with ‘virtual currencies’ are NOT covered by any type of private or state guarantee.”      Following the warnings published by the authorities local media reported in 2018 that a number of banks shut down accounts held by Buda.com. Alejandro Beltrán, country manager for Buda.com, told CoinDesk in January the exchange collaborated with the local blockchain and fintech associations to appeal to President Iván Duque Márquez to allow the reopening of accounts and Buda.com operations.      “But he could not help us directly and instead, sent us to the Ministry of Economy,” Beltrán said.      According to Beltrán, Buda.com then tried to take legal action against the financial authority. The goal was to clarify if banks were allowed to host accounts associated with crypto entities. Finally, they received a response from the financial authorities stating the law did not prevent banks from providing services to crypto firms.      Read more: Crypto Is Booming in Economically Challenged Argentina      “The response of the financial supervisor was that they did not forbid the relationship between banks and exchanges that operate with cryptocurrencies, but there are restrictions in terms of using cryptocurrencies inside the banks,” Beltrán said.      In Colombia, virtual currencies are treated as personal property and are not subject to value-added tax.      Beyond that, there is not much clarity in crypto policy, with a few specific exceptions.      For instance, in December 2020 the Superintendency of Corporations declared that companies operating in the country are allowed to convert capital to bitcoin while making sure they are complying with local crypto regulations.      Beltrán suggested that a lack of regulatory clarity may have led to the creation of the large informal market for crypto trading.    Bargain bitcoin    According to Rivas of Paxful, Colombians can buy bitcoin locally at relatively competitive prices, therefore creating an extremely active internal market and high demand for the crypto.      “They basically have an opportunity to buy bitcoin cheaper and sell at a market price or above elsewhere, which lets Colombians take advantage of arbitrage earnings big time,” Rivas said.      Beltrán confirmed that bitcoin can indeed be purchased at a cheaper price locally through the informal markets, perhaps because the U.S. dollar is sold in the black markets at least 6%-8% cheaper than the official rates.      Atlas also said that although large exchanges like Buda.com operate in the country, some people choose to trade outside platforms via social media.      “People have group chats on Telegram, Whatsapp, Facebook, more peer-to-peer kind of thing,” Atlas said.      Beltrán confirmed this, adding that Colombia has to process a considerable amount of remittances each year, much of it headed towards its neighbor Venezuela, and that competitive bitcoin prices may arise from the remittance markets as well.    Migration    As of June 30, 2019, the United Nations declared there were 1.4 million Venezuelan immigrants residing in Colombia, having fled the country due to political and economical instability.      According to Beltrán, sending money out of Colombia can be cumbersome. The difficulties mostly arise from the strict anti-money laundering measures taken to control money moving in and out of Colombia through drug cartels. In a 2020 report, the U.S. Department of State named Colombia as one of the major money-laundering jurisdictions in the world.      “Your procedures are 100% offline, your money takes two to five days to arrive at the destination. And, well, when you see the limitations that we have right here, because of the financial restrictions of the banks, you see that bitcoin is working for not only remittances but e-commerce as well,” Beltrán said.      Read More: Crypto Remittances Prove Their Worth in Latin America      In 2018, a user by the name of Joshua Nix posted on a public forum about the difficulties of cross border transactions in Colombia.      “I [used] to buy bitcoin from a seller in Bogotá at up to 10% less than market price … Instead of paying about 10% to Western Union for fees and a s***** exchange rate I actually made about 10%,” Nix said.      Meanwhile, Atlas views bitcoin as a long-term investment and possible ticket to a better life. He said he has maintained his initial bitcoin savings. He explained that his choice to hang on to his bitcoin was partially inspired by what he called the “American hodl culture” on Twitter. Hodl is slang for investors holding crypto assets instead of selling them.      “I'm still working. I'm still wearing rags. I still have no girl. I'm still basically a loser. That's fine by me. I just really want to reach a new level in my life. I really want to take my family out of here,” Atlas said.      Atlas, who has lost friends to violence, said he got off easy with his short stint in jail. But he believes his decision to invest in bitcoin and its success so far has changed him by giving him the confidence to improve his life. He has started to learn coding and has plans to purchase a laptop to pursue it further. His faith in bitcoin’s future is so great he told his family that since they are already poor, one more year would not make much of a difference if bitcoin has the potential to hit $100,000.      “So it's like, either we hit a home run or we stay where we are. There's no middle ground,” Atlas said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/13/no-middle-ground-inside-colombias-race-to-become-a-major-regional-crypto-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/69950ebcc7a645e05f69da1f5375f8200897ee6c-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Speaking at a public event hosted by blockchain analysis firm Elliptic on Wednesday, Brooks said the world needs to stop politicizing tech, pointing to the reaction after an attempted insurrection in Washington, D.C., last week that saw supporters of President Donald Trump break into the Capitol building in an effort to halt the formal certification of the Electoral College votes by the Congress.      “We had a really, really awful event in the United States last week, as everybody knows, I mean we saw things that were not worthy of a mature democracy in the 21st century, not worthy of the eras of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison,” Brooks said. “What has followed from that, however, is truly chilling. Now you’ve got payments companies saying that they will not process the payments of people who are of a certain political party who voted one way on a contested political issue.”      Payments platforms Shopify and Stripedeplatformed Trump’s campaign after the violence, which saw five deaths, including that of a Capitol Police officer.      Brooks said this is an extension of the existing pressure payment companies have exerted on businesses in the past, such as Mastercard and Visa announcing they wouldn’t process transactions for pornography.      He also pointed to the firearms and tobacco industries as areas financial institutions do not want to service. The OCC under Brooks is looking into creating a rule that would prohibit institutions from not providing services to certain industries, including the energy and crypto sectors. While a public comment period on the proposal has closed, the rule itself has not yet been finalized.      “We live in a world where not only information, but also money might be controlled by a handful of elites who might not like the way that any one of us thinks [about an issue],” Brooks said in the livestreamed interview with Elliptic CEO Simone Maini. “This is what decentralization is about. In the world of crypto, there is no CEO. Crypto is about freedom and if you didn’t believe that freedom mattered last week, you should think about it again.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/01/13/financial-censorship-after-capitol-riot-truly-chilling-says-occ-chief-brian-brooks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/048d6c5c9f97e6d3575b96834b94656efc001650-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Minnesota-based Compute North has allocated hosting facilities and 47 megawatts (MW) of power for 14,000 Whatsminer M30S mining machines supplied by New York-based Foundry Digital as part of an agreement to provide a “turnkey” hosted mining solution. (Foundry is a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group.)      Foundry has hosted mining devices with Compute North for over a year, according to Foundry CEO Mike Colyer. This latest batch of miners sent to Compute North for hosting will be deployed in Q1 2021, at which point investors can purchase hosted machines through either company.      In the past year, mainstream interest in mining has soared along with bitcoin’s price, causing investors to pile into public North American mining companies and prompting shares of most of these companies to handily outperform bitcoin, as CoinDesk reported.

The People’s Hospital of Chengmai County, a public hospital in the Hainan province of South China, is the first hospital to issue and keep track of invoices on a blockchain in the province, according to a report by Chinese state media China News Service.      While not the first in China, Hainan is one of the few provinces that have successfully incorporated blockchain technology into their public institutions’ online administrative platforms.      The hospital sent invoices to so-called “ticket holders” on its patients’ phones. The patients can check the immutable medical and billing records for reimbursement without going to the hospital, according to the report.      The platform is now only available in the city but it is set to branch out to the rest of the province as the local government is focused on applying blockchain technology to processing official documents for other public institutions.      “Building on the pilot projects, we will optimize blockchain-based platforms and move more administrative work onto the chain so that government agencies can share information through the same system,” an official from the province’s ministry of finance said.      The southern Chinese province has preferential economic policies to lure blockchain companies to open offices in the province. The province capital Haikou is home to some of the leading Chinese blockchain companies, including Huobi China.      Provincial governments have carried out a variety of blockchain innovation initiatives since Chinese president Xi Jinping called on the nation to “seize the opportunities” to develop the technology in his speech in September 2019.

Leading the desk is securities industry veteran Greg Bunn, who’s being hired as CrossTower’s chief strategy officer.

42405695,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedtMu,1610550005,Ledger Adds Bitcoin Bounty and New Data Security After Hack,"Matt Johnson, Ledger's new Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), had no choice but to hit the ground not just running but, well, sprinting. His first week of work entailed scrutinizing the fallout from an extensive data dump of customer information, among other areas such as data security and increased attacks that would come as a byproduct of bitcoin pumping.      In the aftermath of the largest hack in company history, and a little over a week after Johnson started, the hardware wallet company Ledger has announced its first measures to address the data breach and ensure such a hack doesn’t happen again.      These include working with blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis to hunt the hackers, offering a 10 BTC bounty for information leading to the hacker’s arrest and creating a comprehensive review of what information the company holds onto, where it’s stored and how long it’s retained.      Simultaneously, Ledger revealed that because of rogue actors at e-commerce partner Shopify, 20,000 new customer records, including emails, names, postal addresses and phone numbers, along with what products were ordered, have been exposed.    The Ledger hack    Ledger publicly revealed that customer information had been compromised in July 2020. At the time, the company estimated 9,500 customers had been affected by the hack. In the following months, CoinDesk documented a string of convincing phishing attempts executed by the hackers, including emails that mimicked official Ledger correspondence and text messages.      Then, in December 2020, a data dump “exposed 1 million email addresses and 272,000 names, mailing addresses and phone numbers belonging to people who had ordered Ledger’s devices, which store the private keys for cryptocurrency wallets,” as CoinDesk reported. The number of people affected was much higher than the original estimate of 9,500.      A rash of SIM swaps were reported in the days following the data dump and some customers started getting extortion emails, including threats of violence.      In an interview last December, Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier told CoinDesk the initial hack was, in part, a result of the company scaling so quickly, and that he and incoming CISO Matt Johnson would be announcing a new data policy and plan to further address the leaks in January.      Now, Ledger has released new information about the hack, revealing that it was likely due, in part, to rogue actors at Shopify, its e-commerce partner at the time.    Read more: Why Ledger Kept All That Customer Data in the First Place  Shopify’s rogue agents    On Dec. 23, 2020, Ledger was notified by Shopify of an incident “involving merchant data in which rogue member(s) of their support team obtained customer transactional records, including Ledger’s. The agent(s) illegally exported customer transactional records in April and June 2020,” according to a blog post.      Shopify told Ledger the data breach was part of its disclosure in September 2020, which involved over 200 merchants. Until Dec. 21, 2020, though, Shopify had not “discovered that Ledger was also targeted in this attack.” Shopify told Ledger it is continuing to investigate and that the issue had been reported to law enforcement.      In conjunction with forensic firm Orange Cyberdefense, Ledger examined the 292,000 stolen data records. It found that while the database is quite similar to the personal information exposed in the previous attack, there were 20,000 new customer records compromised.      The company said it notified customers who were affected on Jan. 13.    Ledger’s data security after the hack    First and foremost, in a blog post, Ledger reiterated the company will never ask customers for their 24 recovery words, which can be used to access bitcoin and crypto wallets. They also stressed that as long as customers had not shared these words, their Ledger hardware devices were secure.      “We are announcing changes in the way Ledger will collect and handle customer data: keeping personal data for as short a time as legally possible, minimizing the display of personal data in emails, moving needed data in a further segregated environment as soon as possible, and creating a secure channel for communicating 1:1 with our customers via Ledger Live,” the authors, including new CISO Matt Johnson, wrote.      First, Ledger is changing the way it stores data. In an interview, Johnson said that while he would prefer not to have to hold user data at all, the company is legally obligated to do so for a period of time. But Ledger is looking to go beyond what privacy is required by the European Union’s General Protection Data Regulation, according to Johnson.      ""By going beyond the GDPR, what we mean is not 'holding data longer than GDPR requires', but quite the opposite,"" said Johnson. ""Our goal is to delete data such as name, address, and phone number as soon as possible, even if we would be allowed to keep them under the GDPR. Some data, however, we will need to keep to fulfill our legal obligations such as accounting or tax requirements, and this data will be further segregated to limit its access.""    Read more: ‘Convincing’ Phishing Attack Targets Ledger Hardware Wallet Users  Delete, delete, delete    Moving forward, Ledger will delete data from its e-commerce partner as well as move customer data to a database that can’t be accessed from the internet as soon as your order is fulfilled, before deleting it as soon as they’re legally able.      The company will also be deleting names, addresses and phone numbers from confirmation emails sent to customers so that this data is not passed through third-party e-commerce email providers.      The email and social media will only be used for marketing messages and announcements, Ledger Live accounts are being set up to communicate technical and security information, seemingly to avoid instances of previous phishing scams, in which scammers encouraged Ledger users to download important security updates via genuine-looking emails.      Finally, Johnson will be doing a comprehensive review of third parties handling the data.      “I will be going through and doing an examination of every single one of our third parties that we have to share or have the transmission of the data with as part of the supply chain,” said Johnson in a Zoom call.      “We'll be going through and looking at making sure that all of their processes are appropriate and rigorous, because if we're entrusting our data to them, we need to be 100% sure that they are actually operating to the best of their capability to meet all of those minimal requirements, and preferably push them to go beyond that.”    A bitcoin bounty and law enforcement    Ledger is working with various law enforcement agencies as well as the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. It has even set up a bitcoin bounty for information related to those responsible for the hack.      “We're running down leads so we can actually be able to recover, if that's at all possible, stolen funds if it's landing on exchanges,” said Johnson. “We want to make sure information is all being obtained in a legal way and shared directly with law enforcement agencies.      Johnson said Ledger wants to make sure all information gathering is done legally and “above board” with the goal of prosecuting the individuals responsible.    Read more: From SIM-Swaps to Home-Invasion Threats, Ledger Leak Has Cascading Consequences    The blog post qualified the bitcoin bounty, stating that the BTC will be disbursed at the discretion of Ledger and will take a variety of factors into consideration. In echoing Johnson’s comments, these include whether the information has been obtained legally, whether it’s new, how substantial it is and how far it would go toward furthering the investigation and successful prosecution.      The company also hopes it can collaborate with other companies and individuals in the crypto industry to fund this bounty. It envisions a general purpose bounty fund, a sort of foundation to fight scamming and phishing attacks across the industry.      “We are actively trying to do things to protect and improve that ecosystem,” said Johnson.    Protecting your bitcoin even when recovery phrase is shared    The Ledger engineering team is also developing a product that “will protect the funds of a user even if they had shared their recovery seed with an attacker.”      Jerôme De Tychey, Global Head of Client Success at Ledger, said in an email the majority of the phishing attacks rely on making the Ledger Nano owners reveal their 24-word phrase. Scammers seize on that opportune moment of panic where the owners believe their funds to be at risk. Remembering crucial safety measures at that moment is not always possible, especially when the scammers pose as Ledger support staff.      “We are acknowledging this problem and we will soon release a technical solution that will remove the 24 words as the single pillar of the security of our hardware wallets and will open the door to funds insurance as well,” said De Tychey in an email to CoinDesk      Moving ahead, how and when these changes are clarified and implemented will go a long way toward regaining users’ trust. But they represent a step forward for Ledger’s security in the aftermath of an extensive data breach, and just may work for the crypto community more generally. With bitcoin and other altcoins booming, the security around crypto tools and products is an iterative process.      “There are always these new avenues that people attempt to exploit,” said Johnson. “So we have to do that continual reassessment and ask what else we can do to make this even more secure than what it is today. Ledger wallets haven't been compromised, so they're going after the human elements time and time and time again. So what else can we do? What else can we do to help protect the end customer? Because these are real people.”      Updated: Jan. 13, 202 16:14 UTC: The amount of the bitcoin bounty has been changed from 5 BTC to 10 BTC.

42405699,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedtPr,1610549810,"First Mover: Don't Like $34K Bitcoin? Stellar, Litecoin Yet to Conquer Old Highs","Bitcoin snapped a four-day losing streak, appearing to stabilize around $34,000. After the recent market correction, prices for the cryptocurrency are still up 18% year to date, versus a 1.2% gain for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks.      ""Now is probably not the time to panic,"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading at the cryptocurrency exchange firm Diginex, wrote in a daily newsletter.      In traditional markets, European shares fluctuated and U.S. stock futures were little changed as the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday prepared to vote on a second impeachment of President Donald Trump. Gold strengthened 0.1% to $1,855 an ounce.    Market moves    As bitcoin and ether retreat from recent highs, the strong performance of other cryptocurrencies shows that traders and investors may now be turning to alternative tokens, often referred to as ""altcoins,"" for returns.      Bitcoin prices as of Jan. 11 stood at about 87% of their all-time high reached last week, and ether is about 78% of the way toward its all-time high from a few years ago, based on data compiled by CoinDesk Research.      But other cryptocurrencies and digital assets, such as stellar (XLM) and litecoin (LTC), are still far from setting new records. One takeaway might be that they might have further to run, CoinDesk's Muyao Shen reported Tuesday.      Altcoins are surging ""in ways that we have not really seen since 2017,” Andrew Tu, an executive at quant firm Efficient Frontier, told Shen.      It's possible, of course, that some entry-level investors viewing bitcoin's $34,000-ish price – what a small sport-utility vehicle costs – are unaware that the largest cryptocurrency can be bought in minute fractions, similar to the way that it's possible to buy $100 or $1,000 of gold.      Such confusion in the past has led some newbie investors to turn to altcoins, because their prices are often comparatively lower, sometimes counted in cents.      David Derhy, an analyst at the trading platform eToro, wrote earlier this week that some traders might shift toward ether, the base cryptocurrency for the Ethereum blockchain.      ""Investors in bitcoin may be looking to take some profits and reallocate, and ether could be a target,"" he wrote. ""A target of $2,500 is reasonable given the gains we have already seen and current price momentum."" Such a level would represent a gain of nearly 150% from the current price.      Simplex, a digital-asset platform, has been seeing ""increasing demand for cryptos across the board,"" though ""retail investors seem to be looking for the next BTC,"" CEO Nimrod Lehavi, wrote in a Google doc, sent by a spokesman via Zoom's chat function.      “We are used to seeing BTC dominate around 90% of the total volumes of trade,"" says Jonathan Leong, CEO of BTSE, another crypto platform. ""But the recent week or so has seen a rise in our institutional clientele’s demand and interest in altcoins, with the balance being almost 50-50 at certain times.”      Bitpanda, an Austrian cryptocurrency platform, has seen bitcoin drop to between 30% and 40% of customer purchases this year, from 40% to 50% last year, according to a spokeswoman.      ""We have a big influx of users, and they are trading both bitcoin and altcoins,"" the spokeswoman, Sara Moric, said in an email.      - Muyao Shen and Bradley Keoun      Read More: Multiple Tokens See Rally Amid Looming ‘Alt Season’    Bitcoin watch    The near-term outlook for bitcoin has dimmed, analysts say, with some now seeing a possible extension of Monday’s major price drop.      “There could be another dump as outflows from the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Pro have dried up alongside an increased transfer of coins onto exchanges,” David Lifchitz, chief investment officer for Paris-based quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha, told CoinDesk.      Outflows from Coinbase Pro – considered a proxy for purchases of the cryptocurrency by big institutional investors, since the outflows are typically seen as transfers into cold storage for long-term holding – have receded sharply from the three-year high of 55,000 BTC observed Jan. 2.      The decrease could signal a weakening in institutional demand, which played a pivotal role in pushing bitcoin last week to a new all-time high above $41,000, from about $10,000 just a few months ago.      Meanwhile, exchange deposits have gathered pace, a sign that some investors may be looking to liquidate holdings and take profits.      The number of coins held on exchanges increased by over 57,000 BTC on Tuesday, the biggest single-day change since March 2020, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. Exchanges have registered an average inflow of 103,000 BTC per day in the past seven days – higher than the 180-day average of 83,700 BTC.      Some analysts looking for clues in price-chart patterns are also calling for an extension of Monday’s drop. The Ichimoku cloud, a technical-analysis tool created by Japanese journalist Goichi Hosoda in the late 1960s, includes multiple lines that help identify support and resistance levels and other essential information such as trend direction and momentum.“      ""I still see pressure on the downside in the short term,” said Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Swiss firm Crypto Finance AG, adding that $29,000 could be the make-or-break level. ""Things could get ugly if that support is breached,” Heusser said. A price of $36,000 is the level to beat for the bulls.

42405701,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedtRp,1610541000,"Valid Points: Price Dips, 60K Validators and Eth 2.0's 'Graffiti' Messages","It’s been a rough start to the week for crypto investors, although numbers are starting to point upwards once again.      Eyes were anxiously set on a new all-time high for ether that failed to materialize as Bitcoin miners largely pulled the price rug last weekend out from under the entire crypto market.      Let us not despair too much, however. There’s much to be discussed in the world of Ethereum 2.0. This week, we’ll look at some network stats that continue to show healthy growth among multiple key metrics such as active validators and slashing events. After that, we'll look at the role of graffiti messages – the secret notes you can sign to on-chain messages.    Pulse check    Ethereum investors are still picking their teeth up from the floor after a 30% drop in the price of the cryptocurrency over the weekend from a high of $1,334 to $926, according to the CoinDesk 20.      And while red became the unofficial color of many decentralized finance (DeFi) users, Eth 2.0 stakers kept reeling in that sweet, sweet ether. Indeed, Eth 2.0 spits out steady rewards regardless of market conditions, and funds are locked for at least a year or more. So what’s there to worry about in the short run, right?      Looking at the network, the total amount of ether staked increased on the network roughly 5% since Jan. 5, although the total value locked on the contract dropped by about $2 million as the price of ether tumbled.      The Beacon Chain is also showing some 98% network participation, meaning the network is humming along just fine. There are almost 60,0000 active validators on Eth 2.0 as well, according to Beaconcha.in.      Finally, Eth 2.0 almost went a full week without a slashing event. Unfortunately, validator 57976 failed to attest a vote correctly and was subsequently slashed and exited from the validator pool. That event joins 35 other slashing events to date, according to Beaconcha.in.    New frontiers    The launch of a new blockchain is a historic event. To mark the occasion, a little note is often included in the chain’s Genesis block; for example, Bitcoin’s first block included The Times headline below:    The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for bank    A note also accompanied the launch of Ethereum 2.0 on Dec. 1. But it ended up being a smidge less dramatic than Satoshi Nakamoto’s call to arms against central banks:  “Mr. F was here,” the block’s graffiti reads.      As Trustnodes reported, Mr. F is a decentralized application (dapp) developer who happened to be at the right place at the right time. No, it doesn’t have any significance. Yet, it does fit Ethereum community’s quirky nature pretty well, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin pointed out.      You may be wondering what “graffiti” is in the first place – at least, what it is in the context of blockchains. The Eth 2.0 spec describes graffiti as essentially arbitrary data with “no protocol level significance.” Graffiti is signed on the block level versus other arbitrary data inclusion points on the transaction level.      To date, graffiti has mainly been used by staking firms to identify the blocks they’ve validated. A few corny jokes have also been inserted here or there such as “why hodl when you can stake -P.”    Arbitrary on-chain data    There are a few ways to include data such as signed messages into the Eth 1.x blockchain, Teku project owner at ConsenSys Ben Edgington told CoinDesk in a direct message.      The extra data field is perhaps the best corollary to the graffiti field as both occur on the block level and allows for inputting a limited amount of arbitrary info, he said.      (You can also upload information in a separate function, Ethereum’s data field, similarly to Bitcoin’s op_return function. These functions operate on a transaction level rather than the block level, Edgington said. Eth 2.0 can’t yet send transactions so this function does not exist).      Storing random arbitrary data is easier on Ethereum than on Bitcoin, Edgington said.      Indeed, Buterin and most Ethereum developers have never been too concerned with so-called “bloating” the blockchain with data, compared to Bitcoin developers, as CoinDesk reported in 2014 during the thick of the op_return conflict. Data can be stored on-chain as long as it pays the necessary fee to do so.      “The ability for the miner to put a small amount of arbitrary data into a block has always been a feature of Ethereum, and uncontroversial. It's usually used for input data to smart contracts, but doesn't have to be,” Edgington said.

42405700,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedtQq,1610540001,Analysts Are Gloomy About Bitcoin's Short-Term Price Outlook Right Now,"The near-term outlook for bitcoin has dimmed, analysts say, with some now seeing a possible extension of Monday's major price drop.      ""There could be another dump as outflows from the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Pro have dried alongside an increased transfer of coins onto exchanges,"" David Lifchitz, chief investment officer for Paris-based quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha, told CoinDesk.      Bitcoin fell by over 20% on Monday to $30,305 amid heavy selling in the spot market.      Outflows from Coinbase Pro, which are considered synonymous with institutional purchases, have receded sharply from the three-year high of 55,000 BTC observed on Jan. 2.      The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the biggest publicly traded crypto investment trust, hasn't seen inflows since Christmas because it was temporarily closed, as noted by analyst Joseph Young. Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.      That means demand-side pressures, which played a pivotal role in pushing bitcoin from $10,000 to $41,000 over the past three months, had weakened. The trust reopened Tuesday.      Meanwhile, exchange deposits have picked up the pace, a sign that some investors may be looking to liquidate holdings and take profits.      The number of coins held on exchanges increased by over 57,000 BTC on Tuesday, the biggest-single day change since the markets crash on March 12, 2020, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.      Exchanges have registered an average inflow of 103,000 BTC per day in the past seven days – higher than the 180-day average of 83,700 BTC.      ""At a minimum, increased inflows suggest that the type of buyers who self-custody, typically the larger investors, are not buying as much at the moment,"" Chainalysis economist Philip Gradwell told CoinDesk. ""These coins could be held on exchanges to flip if prices rise rather than to sell immediately, but that will put a lid on gains, if any, or even cause a fresh downturn.""      Technical charts are also calling for an extension of Monday's drop.      ""With bitcoin trading below the Ichimoku cloud, I still see pressure on the downside in the short term,"" said Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Swiss firm Crypto Finance AG.      The Ichimoku cloud, a technical tool created by Japanese journalist Goichi Hosoda in the late 1960s, includes multiple lines that help identify support and resistance levels and other essential information such as trend direction and momentum, as shown below.      When an asset trades below the cloud (red line), the trend is said to be bearish, as is the case with bitcoin at press time.      Heusser said that ""$29,000 is the make-or-break level. Things could get ugly if that support is breached,"" and $36,000 is the level to beat for the bulls.      Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, foresees consolidation in the $33,000–$36,000 range for the rest of the week.      The consolidation could end with a bullish move if institutional demand returns. ""We could have a fair amount of fresh buying activity coming over the next few weeks,"" Thomas said, highlighting the reopening of Grayscale Investments' cryptocurrency products to new investors.      While the cryptocurrency may suffer deeper declines in the short term, the broader bias remains bullish.      Also read: Multiple Tokens See Rally Amid Looming ‘Alt Season’      ""Recent institutional investors have long horizons and will absorb near-term price shocks,"" while retail investors would buy at discounted price levels for fear of missing out, Jehan Chu, managing partner at Hong Kong-based Kenetic Capital, said. ""Expect temporary volatility and then a jump back to the $40,000 level, followed by $50,000 as the bitcoin percentage land grab continues.""

The Las Vegas-based company said Tuesday it has entered into a securities purchase agreement with institutional investors for the registered offering of 12.5 million shares of common stock at $20 per share.  Marathon shares dropped to $21.83 on the news, sliding 16.5% in Tuesday’s pre-market session. In the past year, the company's shares have soared over 2,500%.  Gross proceeds for this offering are expected to be $250 million.  CEO Merrick Okamoto told CoinDesk in an email he intends to use the funds to, among other things, fund more mining machine purchases from Bitmain and expand his company's mining facilities amid the mining sector's ongoing ""arms race"" as manufacturers struggle to keep pace with demand.  H.C. Wainwright & Co. is acting as the exclusive placement agent for the offering, which closes on Jan. 15.  The Las Vegas firm's shares surged last week to the highest in more than three years, bringing the firm a total market value of $1 billion. That number is now at $1.377 billion.

Arxnovum Investments Inc. filed documents for the “Arxnovum Bitcoin ETF” on Monday. The ETF is planned to be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) under the ticker ""BIT.U.”      The manager behind the ETF application is Shaun Cumby, CEO of Arxnovum Investments. Previously, Cumby held the position of CIO at 3iq Corp – the Canada-based digital asset manager behind the launch of the Bitcoin Fund (TSX:QBTC.U), called the world's first regulated bitcoin fund.      The New York-based, Winklevoss-owned Gemini Trust company will be the sub-custodian of the bitcoin held by the ETF. The sub-custodian is a trusted company qualified to custody the product's assets held outside of Canada.      According to the prospectus, the proposed bitcoin ETF will provide investors with exposure to bitcoin and daily price movements of the U.S. dollar price of bitcoin by investing in bitcoin and/or bitcoin futures contracts, and/or other derivative instruments that provide economic exposure to bitcoin.      It may trade in bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and other commodity futures exchanges regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures and Trading Commission.      The Arxnovum Bitcoin ETF may also hold cash, cash equivalents and or other fixed-income securities.      The prospectus says an investment in the bitcoin ETF is considered “high risk” and if conditionally approved there is no assurance that the TSX will approve the listing application.

According to a Tuesday press release from the Department of Justice, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Weir sentenced Rossen Iossifov to a 10-year sentence, 85% of which must be served behind bars under U.S. federal law.      The 53-year-old former Bulgarian national was sentenced for conspiracy to commit an offense under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) and conspiracy to commit money laundering.      Iossifov intentionally engaged in business designed to assist criminals in laundering proceeds of fraud and shielded himself from criminal liability, per the release.      Five of Iossifov's main clients in Bulgaria belonged to a criminal enterprise dubbed the Alexandria (Romania) Online Auction Fraud (AOAF) Network. So far, 17 members of the AOAF Network have been convicted for their roles in the scheme.      The online auction fraud gang targeted at least 900 U.S. citizens in a ""large-scale"" operation. Romanian-based members of AOAF posted false advertisements to online sales sites such as eBay and Craigslist for high-cost goods, typically vehicles, that did not actually exist.      After victims sent payment, the money was laundered using cryptocurrency accepted on behalf of domestic associates who would then transfer the cryptocurrency proceeds to foreign-based money launderers.      See also: Centra Tech Co-Founder Handed Prison Term for $25M Crypto Fraud      Iossifov undertook the last step in the scheme on behalf of the criminal network, the court found. In less than three years, Iossifov laundered close to $5 million in cryptocurrency for four of the five AOAF criminal co-conspirators.      More than $7 million in total was defrauded from U.S. victims via the scheme.

Coinbase blamed the problems on months of heavy customer trading activity from platform newcomers and returning accounts.  ""Evolving regulatory requirements"" also led to Coinbase placing temporary restrictions on accounts for which it needed to collect more information.  In the post Coinbase refused to give ground on its regulatory obligations but said it ""can do a better job in communicating"" those burdens to customers.  The company said it is streamlining its information collection procedures to help salve regulatory lockouts.  Coinbase did not address, nor apologize for, its global troubles in keeping all operations running smoothly through heavy trading days.
