The blockchain-related explosive and disruptive innovations seem to come from a shared ontological hunger: that deeper side of the human being that urges us to fill in the void that makes us so different from other animals species. Spoiler alert: the void cannot be filled. But trying -creating, innovating, going against the system, etc- to make something with it is what keeps us moving, conscious, and alive. The opposite is to become purposeless zombies that do exactly everything they&apos;re told to do. What You Should Know About DAOs So, Daos. Smart contracts, decentralization, collectively finding an alternative to the traditional structures: 3 big guys on top and thousands of workers who cannot be part of major decisions inside the environment they dedicate their lives to. Basically most corporations. 2021 was a blooming year for Web3, DeFi, the metaverse, NFTs, and DAOs. It has all started to go mainstream. It&apos;s getting big, it&apos;s everywhere. But there&apos;s so much happening so soon that the bigger picture of these innovations doesn&apos;t have a defined shape yet. Nevertheless, it&apos;s important to approach the urge that lays behind everything that&apos;s exploding around us, because it&apos;s likely about to become part of everyone&apos;s life. So what are DAOs?

Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin slumps to below $48,000, as December’s options expiration nears  Technician’s take (Editor’s note): Technician’s Take is taking a hiatus for the holidays. In its place, First Mover Asia is publishing CoinDesk reporter Sanadali Handagama’s interview with European Parliament member Eva Kaili. The discussion covered MiCA, the current regulatory frenzy over stablecoins, Web 3 and, of course, Facebook’s diem.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $47,701 -6.2%  Ether (ETH): $3,813 -5.7%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,786 -0.1%  DJIA: 36,398 +0.2%  Nasdaq: $15,781 -0.5%  Gold: $1,807 -0.2%  Market moves  Bitcoin, the oldest cryptocurrency, dropped by more than 6% to under $48,000 during the U.S. trading day on Tuesday, despite continued muted spot market activities.  While the spot trading volume of bitcoin remained mostly unchanged from a day ago, its price turbulence came as the market headed into monthly options expiration.  A total of 129,800 option contracts worth more than $6 billion are set to expire on Friday, according to data provided by Skew. As CoinDesk reported previously, data shows that bitcoin tends to move toward the “max pain” point in the lead-up to an expiration and sees a solid directional move in days after settlement.  This price move trend usually comes from spot market manipulations by option sellers (mostly institutional traders) to push the spot price closer to the strike price at which the highest number of open options contracts expire worthlessly. That creates maximum losses – so-called max pain – for option buyers. The max pain point for Friday’s option expiration is $48,000, according to Cayman Islands-based crypto financial services firm Blofin.  Q&A – Eva Kaili  The View From Brussels: How the EU Plans to Regulate Crypto: European Parliament member Eva Kaili says Facebook’s libra announcement in 2019 catalyzed lawmakers into action on digital assets. (By CoinDesk reporter Sandali Handagama)  The European Union (EU) wants to regulate the digital asset industry; there are a number of bloc-wide initiatives already underway. The most comprehensive is a 168-page “Markets in Crypto-Assets” (MiCA) that would create an EU-level licensing framework for crypto issuers and service providers.  But crypto regulations are only one part of a larger Web 3 governance strategy for the political and economic union of 27 nations.  This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Policy Week,” a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa).  According to Eva Kaili, a member of the European Parliament, the new proposals for digital assets, data and artificial intelligence (AI) were inspired by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of 2016, which sought to strengthen consumers’ control over how their data is used by companies that are allowed to operate in the EU.  For digital assets in particular, the catalyst was Facebook’s 2019 plans to create its own stablecoin, libra (now diem), a digital token backed by a basket of currencies and assets, Kaili said. She added that regulatory clarity for digital finance is key to fostering innovation and protecting citizens’ freedom and sovereignty from being exploited by Big Tech.  Kaili is a Greek politician, a member of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament; she was elected in 2014. Kaili has advocated for innovation-friendly regulations for distributed ledger technology (DLT) applications and decentralized finance (DeFi).  CoinDesk got a chance to speak to Kaili about her views on MiCA, the current regulatory frenzy over stablecoins, Web 3 and, of course, Facebook’s diem.  The following has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.  CoinDesk: There are a number of regulatory initiatives in progress in the EU that will directly impact the crypto space in the coming years. Which are the most important, in your opinion?  Kaili: The upcoming regulatory initiatives are designed to provide legal certainty and to test these new technologies in collaboration with traditional players and stakeholders. It will hopefully be completed by the end of 2022.  The first framework is Markets in Crypto-Assets, or MiCA. It’s part of the EU’s digital finance strategy, and it tries to deal in a holistic manner with the crypto ecosystem to establish clear and new licensing requirements that are passport-able. And this means we were trying to pave the way [by] initiating a robust regulatory response, as we did with GDPR.  MiCA will allow firms to operate across the EU, and also set stronger consumer protection standards. It also sets out rules for digital asset issuance and public offerings, and has some specific requirements relating to stablecoins. It lays out additional requirements for the big, systemically important stablecoins, too. MiCA is going through its first readings [in the parliament], so it has some way to go. There have been no consultations between the EU parliament and council yet.  Then you have the pilot regime for market infrastructures based on DLT. I am a rapporteur [the person who gives reports] on that one. I would say it’s not only an ambitious project but also a much anticipated sandbox project. It’s quite unique for the EU because it’s aiming to test new business models deploying DLT in the EU financial infrastructure, and the provisions will translate into a huge testing environment that will operate in a uniform manner across the EU, just like what MiCA is trying to do for crypto assets. It would offer concrete testing outcomes, and then this would feed the future policymaking and regulatory adaptation. So when you are exiting the sandbox, you are participating in creating the regulatory framework to follow. It has gone through the EU Council and parliament first readings, and it seems to go through these negotiations quite smoothly.  CoinDesk: A lot of EU regulators are showing concern over stablecoins, and MiCA is considerably focused on regulating stablecoins in particular. Why is that?  Kaili: Back in 2019, the discussions around Facebook’s stablecoin, libra, now called diem, led us to accelerate legislative initiatives and to explore what could happen if we have global currencies coming from not just central banks but also from private players. Certain stablecoins could work on a global level, and have a global reach. They are what the EU calls significant e-money tokens. They are addressed by MiCA because they could indeed raise concerns regarding the EU monetary policy, stability and sovereignty. But this is not just an EU concern.  Since several countries are now exploring central bank digital currencies including China and Russia, I would say that global stablecoins can have unprecedented effects on all economies because of the connectedness of the financial system. And also consider that for the first time in more than a century, the U.S. dollar supremacy is being challenged. The rise of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins may be forcing us to rethink what a currency is, who regulates it and what it means if it’s not controlled by the national government.  Then, we have this political dimension that we have to take under consideration. Even if we don’t want to admit it, we have to have central bank digital currencies because it’s a matter of geopolitical dominance. It can also become a matter of monetary sovereignty, especially when you don’t have like-minded countries deploying similar platforms and marketplaces.  Read More: DeFi Is Like Nothing Regulators Have Seen Before. How Should They Tackle It? | David Z. Morris  We have to also consider the private players. I think we will very quickly see a digital euro – maybe we’re already late, but I believe if we had stablecoins from Facebook without a central bank digital currency, then the risk would be bigger. But I also think it’s going to be very interesting to consider the flip side. When you have Russia, China, U.S. and Europe launching their own digital currencies, what would that mean for the diem and other private stablecoins?  CoinDesk: Do you feel there’s anything missing in these frameworks, particularly with MiCA?  Kaili: One of the challenges we have is a lack of clear definitions to understand exactly what is not covered by the MiCA.  The problem that we see, and I believe it will have to be addressed by us in the future, is that the decentralized finance, or DeFi, business model does not fit into the MiCA framework as no single entity can be identified in DeFi projects and they do not fall under the definitions used in centralized finance.  There, we have an issue because decentralization has great benefits, but also some significant risks. Crypto adopters cannot turn to the authorities in case of fraud or cyberattacks or if they accidentally lose their funds. If decentralized systems don’t have a clear definition, then we have to definitely address it to give the industry that legal certainty. We also have to support the cryptocurrency exchanges to be able to provide this consumer protection, also for themselves not to face issues that would make it impossible to operate in Europe, and also to help them [learn] what transparency is for us and the governance standards that would protect consumer funds against these attacks and malfunctions within their responsibilities. So these are the main concerns around the MiCA framework.  CoinDesk: How does the EU’s approach to digital asset regulation compare to other jurisdictions around the world?  Kaili: First of all, the nature of the European Union is different. We have 27 different member states with different legal and tax systems that are not harmonized. So we are trying to adopt a unique approach to policymaking with MiCA. We are allowing room to test the technology, we are interacting with stakeholders, and we are trying to establish concrete proposals to create legal certainty, clarity, at least in this first big step that we are taking. When we talk about technology that is developed in a more, let’s say, free way, in the U.S. or Asia, I would say that a lack of standards or legal certainty has its own challenges. You see what’s happening with El Salvador with the government suddenly legalizing bitcoin. You see what happened with China, for example. China had the highest concentration of bitcoin miners and then suddenly changed [its] approach. Then the U.S. [Securities and Exchange Commission], which is reportedly investigating DeFi platforms and the parties behind them. It’s an unclear investigation.  I think the U.S. might be taking a slightly hostile approach. So we try to see what we don’t want to have in Europe. We are more careful. We don’t speed up too much.  We did have some problems initially. We started by trying to fit new things and innovations in old boxes, so we struggled a little. But now, we are trying to create hybrid boxes so we don’t expect innovation to fit our old boxes. We are creating new boxes and allowing them to keep evolving without feeling that it is a hostile environment. This is how I feel, but it also depends on the specific cases. I’m working a lot in the crypto space. So at least I can speak for the crypto space and say that our approach is innovation friendly, mainly.  CoinDesk: It seems as if the apprehension over Facebook’s libra has revealed some greater concerns about the influence of Big Tech in the EU. In the EU at least, as you said, regulating digital assets is not just about digital asset disruption in particular but part of a larger digital strategy concerning the internet, data and financial sovereignty. Is this a fair assessment?  Kaili: We understand that whoever owns or holds data now holds a lot of power and that you can generate great value from data, and this applies to the crypto space, too, as it generates transaction data. As part of the digital strategy, and parallel to MiCA, we are also working on the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act and the Artificial Intelligence Act. For the first time, after several decades, we are using the internet to regulate the internet along with the access to data and the parties that are using this data. So I think that a well-regulated, data-driven financial sector also needs a well-regulated data economy. Data is now a commodity, but many consumers do not understand exactly how it is a commodity. For example, consumers can consent to sharing their data while they can’t control how that data is being used.  I think there is a risk that the greater sharing of data could lead also to customers with certain characteristics to be excluded from markets or from borrowing money. For example, if businesses have access to more data through open finance, this could lead to more personalized pricing of insurance policies, which is an absolute no-go in Europe. This increased individualizing of risk is likely to affect more vulnerable or low-income consumers. If you have predictive [artificial intelligence], for instance, it could lead to calculating credit scores, or insurance premiums for citizens to exclude them or to include them. This could violate our fundamental principles and rights. So we need to have some objectives when we design our strategy to protect fair pricing practices.  I would say there is a great need to have efficient data legislation, and we have to understand the process of how to extract the value of data for the public good and at the same time balance it with innovation. I’d say the data legislation file will arrive in January. This means we will make more data available to European companies, we will make sure that they will have to open up and share some data with startups and researchers, which is not the case at this point. We hope to achieve the portability harmonization of data across the EU, similar to what we’re trying to achieve in the crypto space. It’s the same principles for every sector that we have to also include in the financial sector.  CoinDesk: What you’re saying is it’s important to find a way to make sure that consumer data isn’t siloed by one or two big companies?  Kaili: I don’t believe we should not have big companies. I just believe we should understand their business models and make sure that we set certain rules when we open up to new players. We should have more competition. This will increase and improve the quality of the services. And this would ensure a level playing field for newcomers. But these big players, they’re not really located in the EU, at least, the significant ones that we all understand we’re talking about.  CoinDesk: But wouldn’t this potential carveout of Big Tech go against the EU objective of tech neutrality you mentioned earlier that gives citizens the freedom to decide which tech they want to use to serve them best?  Kaili: I would use the word “reciprocity.” To overcome this problem, you have to set your principles and standards. If a company follows those principles, it should be able to enter your market. If not, they shouldn’t.  This is addressed in the Artificial Intelligence Act that is under the EU parliament microscope. It lays out standards for bigger players, the more risky applications, even if they’re not based in the EU. It means that if you want to access this market, you have to respect the outcome of these principles Europe wants to protect. So if we consider that something they do is harmful, it could be completely banned. This usually applies to businesses that use facial recognition, health-care tech or weaponized AI. Whoever wants to enter the EU market, they have to follow the same rules, even if they come from other countries.  When we created GDPR, everybody thought it would fail. Now it seems like it was not just welcome, but it actually led the way for like-minded countries to improve the quality of services and make sure users feel protected and safe online, and ensuring people’s rights online. So I think we’re going to follow the same path. And we have a lot of work to do to strike a good balance to protect the well-being of citizens, and avoid becoming protectionist.

42375684,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9eO3,1640725855,"Market Wrap Year-End Review: Altcoins, NFTs Filled Void When Bitcoin Got Boring","Hi Market Wrap readers! During the final two weeks of 2021, we’re using this space to recap this year’s most dramatic moments in cryptocurrency markets – and highlight the key lessons from this fast-evolving corner of global finance. Over a series of eight posts that started on Dec. 20 and will run through Thursday, we’ll recap what shook crypto markets this year. (Scroll down for today’s latest crypto-market prices and top gainers/losers.)  On Monday, we showed how some large investors began to cash out of their bitcoin trades in April and May, as prices retreated from the then-all-time-high price of around $65,000. Concerns about rampant speculation and a decline in global money supply growth were some reasons why investors began to jump ship. Then investors became concerned about bitcoin’s environmental footprint, which also caused Tesla to reconsider its involvement in the cryptocurrency. The selling pressure accelerated in May after China banned cryptocurrencies.  It was a wild first half of the year for bitcoin, but by June, the market began to settle down. BTC stabilized at around $30,000 after dropping nearly 50% over the span of a couple months. During that time, traders flocked to alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in hopes of greater profits.  Altcoin season in full effect  Around the start of the year, multiple altcoins began to outperform bitcoin (BTC), reflecting a strong appetite for risk among investors. The payments token XRP rallied nearly eightfold between January and April, and the prices of many decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens such as Aave’s AAVE token and Uniswap’s UNI also soared.  Even during the broad crypto market sell-off, altcoins began to account for a greater share of the total crypto universe – shrinking bitcoin’s “dominance” in the industry jargon. Many “Ethereum killers,” or competitors in the field of smart contracts blockchains, began to grab the attention of traders – such as Solana, with its SOL token. So-called layer 2 tokens such as MATIC from Polygon, which aims to increase the efficiency of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, rose nearly twofold in July.  The chart below shows bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total crypto market capitalization, known as the bitcoin dominance ratio. BTC’s relative market cap loss began to accelerate between March and May before stabilizing at around 40% in the following months.  The NFT craze  As bitcoin’s price stabilized at around $30,000 in July and August, some traders became bored, literally.  It had been clear since March just how far this year’s crypto craze extended beyond bitcoin, when a piece of digital artwork sold for $69.3 million at a Christie’s auction by crypto artist Beeple. In the wake of breathless headlines in traditional media outlets like the New York Times, the potential riches from selling non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, attracted scores of artists, celebrities and traders seeking additional investments in the crypto market.  The Bored Apes Yacht Club became the second-most popular NFT collection by total trade volume behind CryptoPunks, CoinDesk’s Eli Tan wrote in August. At that time, the “floor price” for Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs – the cheapest available on the open market – was 48.8 ETH, or $165,578. (By the end of the year, it would rise even further, to about $240,500.)  Owners of the high-priced NFT collection include National Basketball Association superstar Steph Curry, YouTube creator Logan Paul and musician Jermaine Dupri.  Speculation moves in cycles. Crypto traders began the year in full buying mode and then price declines encouraged some profit-taking as regulatory risks unfolded. The speculative wave had its ups and downs, but traders were able to find opportunities in the alternative crypto market as bitcoin began to lose its relative dominance.  In the next episode, we’ll show how bitcoin’s price broke out of a two month-long sideways range as El Salvador came to the rescue.

Unclear goals, looming security risks and a fickle market could lead to prices drifting lower as interest and attention begin to wane, however. Its market cap now sits at $207 million.  On Christmas, NFT traders awoke to an airdrop of SOS tokens – the governance token for the newly formed OpenDAO.  Airdrops are a token distribution method that allows crypto users who have performed certain actions to claim tokens. In this case, the airdrop applied to any Ethereum address that purchased a non-fungible token (NFT) on the popular OpenSea marketplace – a potential pool of more than 850,000 addresses. To be clear, OpenDAO has no relationship with OpenSea aside from targeting its user base with an airdrop.  According to a Dune Analytics dashboard, so far nearly 275,000 addresses have claimed the airdrop, with the median claim worth $125 at current prices. Many prolific collectors reported claims in the four- and five-figure range, and the exact math used to calculate claim amounts hasn’t been disclosed.  Despite the blazing-hot start for the project, however, multiple experts have cautioned that, due to exploit vulnerabilities and a hazy road map, SOS may already be on the downswing.  Security risks  Shortly after the airdrop, multiple Ethereum developers raised red flags on social media concerning potential attack vectors in the project’s code – namely, the risk of a “rug” from the founding contributors.  Fifty percent of the token supply is in the hands of three addresses controlled by the core team. These tokens are reserved for staking rewards, liquidity mining incentives and a DAO treasury, but have no on-chain security guarantees – such as a time lock, vesting schedule or a multisignature wallet, or multisig – protecting them.  Hypothetically the team has the ability, at any time, to take these tokens and dump them on centralized and decentralized exchanges, making millions and driving the value of the token to zero – one of the types of scams often referred to as “rug pulls.”  In an interview with CoinDesk, OpenDAO core contributors said that there is a nomination process underway in the project’s Discord channel to elect seven multisig signers, which would mean transactions require a four-of-seven majority to move forward.  Additionally, in an interview with CoinDesk, Quadrata Network co-founder Fabrice Cheng said the airdrop distribution architecture could enable the core team to “over time silently and slowly [claim] tokens that are normally reserved for the [OpenDAO] community.”  Due to the distribution calculations not being disclosed, verifying if the claims function has been exploited is difficult, but there’s no clear evidence that it has. The core team is largely anonymous or pseudonymous.  The DAO will also be closing the redemption period for the airdrop in June, and any unclaimed tokens will be transferred to the DAO treasury.  Limited utility  As the core team looks to put basic security measures in place, the community is now working to decide what the SOS token will actually be used for.  While some on social media have speculated that OpenDAO might use its sudden influx of funds to attempt to build a decentralized alternative to OpenSea, the team’s stated ambitions are more modest.  In early promotional materials, the core team advertised using the treasury to compensate victims of common NFT scams and hacks, “preserve NFT art” and “support NFT artists.”  Additionally, the core contributors are evaluating use case suggestions from the community.  “There have been many wonderful and brilliant ideas, but we are giving a cooling period before the elections of our multisignature wallet signers,” said one contributor in an interview.  The DAO has held two votes for token holders, including one to initiate a staking program that will generate rewards over a one-year period and one for a liquidity mining program that will reward liquidity providers over a two-year period.

Despite the token’s limited utility, core contributors have been successful on the business development front. In the project’s Discord channel, contributors have announced a steady stream of partnerships with a number of wallets and marketplaces.  Community formation  Multiple observers have marveled at how the project has managed to grow so quickly despite both its security risks and a lack of a product or vision.  Targeted airdrops, a token distribution method that unites users who might not know each other but who have performed similar on-chain actions, is part of the recipe for success, according to some experts.  “SOS is a good example of how tokens can be a great way to coordinate a community, even if there isn’t a product,” said prolific NFT collector and Ex Populus co-founder Soban “Soby” Saqib. “Bootstrapping communities is difficult in the traditional world, but tokens and NFTs allow us to accelerate this in Web 3.”  Additionally, the lack of a road map for the project may paradoxically be serving as a tailwind for the token. As one crypto researcher put it, the proximity to OpenSea paired with a lack of details about the token’s eventual use ultimately led to a surge in interest:  Future prospects  A number of notable traders, personalities and founders are included in SOS’ list of top holders, including Aave co-founder Stani Kulechov and pseudonymous NFT mega-investor Pranksy.  The Sushi SOS-ETH decentralized exchange pool remains a “hot contract,” according to wallet profiler Nansen, and Nansen co-founder Alex Svanevik told CoinDesk on Saturday that the token was one of the most popular among the “smart money” segment over the past three days.  However, the hype train is showing signs of slowing. According to CoinGecko, trading volume has been declining on a steady basis since Sunday, and prices have drifted lower, as well.  In a recent blog post, popular crypto trader and podcast host Jordan “Cobie” Fish wrote that for buzzy assets like SOS with no product, the level of attention a project can sustain and its prices are often directly correlated, and keeping attention is difficult work.  “Once an asset has entered the consciousness of many players, it is easier to get all players to think about this asset again, but achieving sustained attention without a product and without users is much harder,” he wrote.  As on-chain governance – a process at times notably slow and inefficient – grinds on and security risks remain a threat, it’s unclear how long SOS can hold the interest of the notably fickle crypto community, and prices may soon reflect that.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | AIRDROP,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/28/opendaos-sos-token-hits-250m-market-cap-despite-unclear-goals-security-risks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f747e3824d1c312b1d98c4043f802d948e9eb234-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411593,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOzgs,1640718289,Pantera’s Paul Veradittakit’s 2022 Predictions,"2021 has been an extraordinary year for crypto. We saw decentralized finance (DeFi) swell to a $100 billion+ industry, bitcoin (BTC) reach a price peak of $69,000, massive ecosystem growth for companion blockchain networks (layer 2) such as Arbitrum and alternative chains like Solana, over $22 billion in sales for non-fungible tokens (NFT) and more mainstream and institutional interest than ever before.  Paul Veradittakit is a partner at Pantera Capital.  Here are six of my top predictions for how the sector will fare in 2022:  L2s and Rollups: Rollup scalability platforms built on Ethereum, such as Arbitrum and StarkEx, will continue to gather traction as an immediate and long-term solution for Ethereum’s increasing network congestion.  Non-Ethereum/Bitcoin Chains: Decentralized application (dapp) ecosystems in alternative smart contract blockchains, such as Solana and Binance Smart Chain, will continue to grow as bridges increase cross-chain access to liquidity and developer platforms make it easier to launch dapps on other chains.  Composability and Web 3: Projects will find new, powerful ways to integrate with one another to create a unified user experience across the online ecosystem. Mechanisms for digital ownership and data management will also expand, allowing for the development of a more robust, high-utility digital identity.  Expansion of NFTs: NFTs will continue to soar in popularity as the digital art ecosystem grows. NFTs will also power several use cases in verticals besides pure images, including gaming, music and creator/influencer fanbases.  DAOs: More decentralized autonomous organizations will launch around unique, fascinating use cases as people increasingly buy into the concept of digital collective action. Along with the growth of DAOs, we’ll see significant development in tooling for DAO management and operations as DAOs grow more complex in organization and function.  DeFi Security: On the heels of several large DeFi exploits in 2021, security will be a bigger priority than ever for DeFi protocols in 2022. Projects emphasizing runtime security and insurance against smart contract attacks will help secure dapps on various blockchains, increasing mainstream users’ confidence and trust in DeFi as a financial ecosystem.  2021: The year of crypto fever  2021 may have been the most exciting, tumultuous year for crypto yet. We witnessed incredible growth and innovation, including Ethereum’s highly anticipated London hard fork, the explosive expansion of the Solana ecosystem over the summer, and bitcoin’s all-time high price of $69,000 in November. Simultaneously, we’ve seen crypto’s inefficiencies and vulnerabilities at full blast, from Ethereum’s ridiculous gas fees to the $600 million exploit of PolyNetwork’s smart contracts.  What is indisputable is that crypto has captured the public eye like never before. Each day, thousands of users are registering addresses on the blockchain, scouring NFT collections on OpenSea and investing more capital into DeFi and Web 3. As 2022 begins, I look forward to seeing how this mainstream attention guides the direction and speed of crypto innovation, extending the boundaries of what crypto can accomplish and helping achieve its vision of a decentralized, user-first financial system.  About last year’s predictions:  Here is a review of my predictions from last year. For each prediction I’ll summarize the key developments in that space in 2021 and provide an accuracy rating to benchmark how well my initial prediction held up, with 1 being the least accurate and 5 being the most accurate.  Growth of bitcoin: Bitcoin underwent explosive growth in 2021, reaching an all-time high of $69,000, more than double its 2020 all-time high of $28,000. At its peak, BTC hit a market cap of over $1 trillion – a feat that took Apple 42 years to accomplish, Amazon 24 years to accomplish and Google 21 years to accomplish; in contrast, BTC is barely 12 years old. Adoption grew significantly as well: the first bitcoin-linked exchange-traded fund (ETF) launched on Wall Street in October, institutional investors poured nearly $17 billion into the digital asset,and 34 public companies reported bitcoin on their balance sheet this year.  With these incredible gains, the asset still continues to experience considerable volatility, reaching a low of $29,807 in June and plummeting nearly 19% in a single day in December. Moreover, it’s important to note that other digital assets, like ether (ETH), have also grown immensely in 2021, reducing bitcoin’s share of the overall crypto market from 70% to 40%.  Read more: Pantera Capital Raises $600M for New Crypto Fund: Report  Nonetheless, it’s clear that bitcoin remains one of the world’s most valuable assets and continues to demonstrate the tangible value of digital scarcity and decentralization, helping pave the way for all digital assets.  Accuracy: 5  Government exploration of CBDCs: In 2021, we saw interest from even more central banks around central bank digital currencies (CBDC). A survey by the Bank of International Settlements found that 86% of central banks are researching the potential for CBDCs, with 14% already launching pilot projects.  In the U.S., legislators began to discuss the concept of the digital dollar with the introduction of H.R. 2211 in March, while the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston will soon release a summary of its findings from its research into CBDCs. In Europe, the European Central Bank has launched a project to develop a digital Euro, with an expected timeline of two years.  Some countries have gone further with ongoing CBDC pilots. China has completed over $9.7 billion in transactions with the digital yuan, and is currently exploring how CBDCs can facilitate cross-border payments with Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates and Thailand. Kazakhstan, Chile and Nigeria have also all launched pilot CBDCs. Globally, progress on CBDCs primarily remains in a research stage, but government interest in state-issued digital currencies is growing steadily.  Accuracy: 4  Explosion of DeFi: 2021 was DeFi’s biggest year yet, with the total value locked (TVL) in the ecosystem growing from $27 billion at the start of the year to a peak of $110 billion in November. Lending, in particular, grew to a TVL of $47 billion in 2021, which is a near 560% increase from last year. Though most lending protocols remain overcollateralized, several newer projects are beginning to experiment with uncollateralized loans, including Alchemix (which uses yield-generating positions as collateral) and Goldfinch Finance (which uses a tranche loan structure to handle risk).  Automated market makers (AMM), which handled a peak monthly trading volume of $162.8 billion in March, also saw significant innovation, including the launches of Uniswap’s third version (v3) (allowing for more flexible liquidity provisioning) and protocols like Clipper Exchange (which are optimized for smaller trades).  Stablecoins, another cornerstone of DeFi, grew to a collective market cap of nearly $160 billion this year, with the top fouer stablecoins each having individual market caps over $200 million, reflecting significant diversity in usage and adoption. Stablecoins offer a critical fiat analog in crypto, which is particularly important given the long-standing difficulties with retail cash in and cash out services.  Accuracy: 5  Widespread adoption: While crypto has yet to become part of the bread-and-butter of most people’s everyday lives, 2021 saw an enormous number of people enter the crypto space – or at least start to pay attention to it. Over 38 million new addresses were registered on Ethereum in 2021, which constitutes 22% of all addresses ever created. Also, 46% of Uniswap’s active users each month were new, indicating that people are tumbling down the DeFi rabbit hole at unprecedented speed.  Several big tech players also made major waves in crypto; Facebook rebranded as Meta, Square rebranded as Block and Stripe hired Paradigm’s Matt Huang to its board. Globally, crypto interest has grown remarkably as well; most notably, El Salvador made bitcoin a form of legal tender, and is planning to use bitcoin to fund several infrastructural projectshttps://time.com/6122250/bitcoin-city-el-salvador/ in the country. All in all, crypto has captured the world’s interest like never before, and I am beyond excited to see how this attention shapes the direction of crypto innovation in the years to come.  Accuracy: 4  Regulatory clarity: It would be inaccurate to say we’ve received more regulatory clarity around crypto this year, but we’ve certainly seen regulators pay more attention to crypto and digital assets than ever before. We’ve seen both positive and negative sentiments, from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s announcement that banks can legally use stablecoin transactions to facilitate payments to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rejection of VanEck’s proposal for an ETF that would directly hold bitcoin. Tax reporting was a particularly key focus for U.S. regulators, most notably through President Joe Biden’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure package in November, which included language requiring crypto exchanges to directly report all transactions to the Internal Revenue Service.  Globally, numerous governments have begun or continue to crack down on crypto. China has banned all activities related to bitcoin outright, while Nigeria, Turkey and Iran have also prohibited using cryptocurrencies for payments. Unfortunately, regulation surrounding cryptocurrencies remains imprecise and lacks nuance, and we still don’t have clear expectations around what most governments view as fair and legal.  Accuracy: 3  Crypto M&A, unicorns and IPOs: As of this writing, at least 65 companies focusing on blockchain development or cryptocurrencies have achieved unicorn status (meaning a valuation of more than $1 billion), including NFT marketplace OpenSea, blockchain game development platform Dapper Labs and blockchain development suite Alchemy. Coinbase famously made the first crypto initial public offering (IPO) earlier this year, opening at $342 per share.  In M&A, volume surged to nearly $6.1 billion with more than 197 acquisitions, including Coinbase’s purchase of Bison Trails and Galaxy’s $1.2 billion purchase of BitGo. Many historically non-crypto fintech players are making crypto acquisitions as well, such as Mastercard and Robinhood. In sum, crypto has never been a hotter focus for larger businesses, and companies are clearly eager to introduce or expand their crypto capabilities.  Accuracy: 4  Digitization of private assets: 2021 saw the launch of several projects to digitize private assets. A notable example is French bank Société Général’s proposal to the MakerDAO to take out a loan of $20 million in dai (DAI) against its newly developed bond tokens; institutions are becoming increasingly invested in opening crypto positions and integrating crypto with their real-world holdings.  While these launches are incredibly exciting, signals from longer-term projects suggest crypto’s overall movement to digitize real-world assets may be on the back burner. Synthetix and Mirror, two protocols that enable on-chain exposure to real world assets, saw their TVL decrease significantly over the course of the year.  Though there is more surface area to synergize real-world and digital assets than ever before, crypto’s key focus seems to be placed elsewhere, largely because of limited infrastructure for traditional finance (tradfi) integrations and uncertain regulations.  Accuracy: 2  Read more: The Future of Money: 20 Predictions  Looking ahead  Here are six areas where I expect to see significant innovation and growth in 2022.  Layer 2s and Rollups: The biggest criticisms of Ethereum today involve its ridiculously high latency and gas fees, which inhibit the computational capacity of dapps and discourage users who lack substantial capital. Layer 2 systems have tackled this problem by executing transactions off-chain (reducing the amount of slow, expensive on-chain computation) and then posting batched transaction data (a rollup) on-chain.  Layer 2s have become incredibly popular in the last year. Arbitrum, an optimistic rollup solution that launched only in September, reached a peak TVL this year of $2.78 billion and has amassed over 50 dapps, including 1inch, Balancer, and Coinbase Wallet. Zero-knowledge rollups rose in TVL from $43.5 million to $1.9 billion, and are already being leveraged to scale transaction throughput for dapps like dYdX.  As mainstream adoption of crypto continues to grow, Ethereum’s network congestion will only become worse, exacerbating its problems with latency and fees. Rollups are critical to sustaining the growth of Ethereum by ensuring that compute infrastructure is highly scalable, allowing users to interact with dapps with similar or even better expectations around usability as with traditional web apps. Both optimistic and ZK rollups will gain even more traction in the coming year, with optimistic rollups likely to dominate in the short term while ZK rollups, which are much more technically complex, advance as a long-term scalability solution.  Non-Ethereum/Bitcoin chains: At the start of the year, 97% of DeFi’s aggregate TVL belonged to Ethereum; today, Ethereum possesses only 63% of that TVL. Competing layer one, or base, blockchains have grown explosively over the past year, largely thanks to their considerable expansion advantages and differentiated use cases from Ethereum. In particular Solana, which offers unparalleled transaction throughput, saw an incredible 2021, reaching a peak TVL of $15 billion and a peak price of nearly $260 in November. Recent activity in the Solana community, including the launches of massive funds for decentralized social media and gaming, suggest that the ecosystem will continue to grow immensely in the coming year.  Beyond specific blockchains, many technological developments from this year have set up 2022 to be a major year for the multi-chain universe. Bridges, such as NEAR’s Rainbow Bridge, will help accelerate the growth of non-Ethereum ecosystems by expanding access to liquidity and allowing easier composability of digital assets. Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) platforms, like Aurora on NEAR, are also making it easier than ever for Ethereum-based dapps to launch on other chains, enhancing cross-chain engagement within DeFi. Overall, these advancements in cross-chain infrastructure will accelerate the speed at which alternative layer one chains gain traction, fostering the development of a truly robust, diverse multi-chain crypto ecosystem.  Composability and Web 3: Web 3 was arguably one of the biggest buzzwords of 2021. The scope of Web 3 is incredibly broad, and it’s difficult to pinpoint what exactly it entails. Generally, however, the term refers to technologies that prioritize user ownership of data and/or assets and interoperability between distinct applications.  2021 was a massive year for digital ownership. NFTs now constitute a $7 billion industry, and continue to grow as more and more artists and consumers of art seek forms of verifiable ownership within the digital sphere. Beyond NFTs, digital ownership has grown through initiatives towards decentralized crowdfunding (such as Kickstarter’s announcement of decentralizing on Celo) and decentralized identity projects, which allow users to maintain full, more precise control over personal data and reputation, enabling use cases around un-collateralized loans, know your customer (KYC) rules and more. In 2022, we’ll see more projects expand the scope of on-chain ownership, allowing users to have full, functional control over their identity and holdings in the digital world.  In terms of interoperability, bridges, as mentioned earlier, have enabled significantly more composability within DeFi, effectively allowing users to transact assets between chains and utilize DeFi protocols across different blockchains. Beyond just DeFi, projects like login.xyz, which offers a Sign-In with Ethereum service, show how the blockchain might enable composability between apps more generally, allowing users to maintain a single login across all services. Altogether, applications and services are seeking tighter integrations with one another, and I expect to see more projects tackle the fragmented nature of how we interact with the web.  Expansion of NFTs: NFTs were undoubtedly one of the hottest crypto trends of 2021. Digital asset marketplace OpenSea went from $1 billion to over $10 billion in trading volume in just three months, showcasing the viral wave of adoption that NFTs have kicked off. Other projects, like NBA Top Shot and Bored Ape Yacht Club, have given NFTs a remarkable platform in popular culture, so much so that “NFT” was one of Google’s top search queries this year.  Looking ahead, it’s important to note that physical art represents a whopping $1.7 trillion asset class, meaning that NFTs are barely beginning to scratch the surface. As digital art continues to grow in popularity and physical art becomes increasingly tokenized, to facilitate better verifiability and more liquid markets, NFTs will continue to grow immensely in popularity through the coming year.  Beyond the classical use case of images, NFTs are making significant headway in other verticals, namely gaming and music. Games like Decentraland and Axie Infinity have demonstrated the value of offering in-game assets as tradable NFTs, allowing players to have full, versatile ownership of their assets and state within the game. In music, projects like Audius and Royal are building mechanisms to help fans directly support projects by their favorite artists, and to share in their artists’ success through royalties. NFT projects in 2022 will show substantially more diversity in use cases and will reconfigure how we interact with and think about ownership of digital media more broadly.  DAOs: DAOs were also one of the hottest crypto trends of 2021, garnering mass attention with the promise of being a vehicle for equitable, decentralized collective action. We’ve seen DAOs launch around a shared digital cultural identity (e.g., FWB and pleasrDAO), around crowdfunding and capital allocation (e.g., BitDAO and ConstitutionDAO), and even around social impact causes as well (e.g., the KlimaDAO tackling climate change). Given their heightened prominence, I expect to see DAOs become a mainstream vehicle for online organizing and collective action, helping individuals across the globe get actionably involved with causes they care about.  Beyond the rising number of DAOs, the crypto space has also begun to recognize (and tackle!) several gaps within DAO tooling, operations, and onboarding. Platforms like Syndicate, which simplify the process for establishing DAOs for collaborative investing, and Station, which helps onboard users onto DAOs, are making it easier than ever for folks to get functional DAOs up and running in record time. As DAO operations grow in complexity, I expect to see even more projects building out DAO tooling and infrastructure in 2022.  DeFi security: 2021 has arguably cast more doubt into the security of DeFi than any year yet. More than $610 million were stolen through DeFi exploits in 2021 (a staggering eightfold increase from $77 million in 2020), and an additional $704 million in funds were stolen and then later returned by white hat hackers, like those behind the $600 million PolyNetwork exploit. These incidents are an inevitable, but unfortunate consequence of the growing prominence of DeFi; still, they highlight several major vulnerabilities in the technical infrastructure powering DeFi, which may ultimately limit DeFi’s potential to capture more financial use cases.  To maintain DeFi’s pace of adoption, it’s absolutely critical that we develop even more protocols and tooling to ensure that users are interacting with safe financial products in crypto. Projects like Forta, which enables dapps to monitor runtime security, and Nexus Mutual, which offers dapp users insurance against smart contract exploits, have already made significant headway in securing the crypto financial ecosystem. Still, there remain a great many vulnerabilities in the smart contracts powering DeFi, the majority of which we still don’t know. In 2022, I expect to see security become a tremendous focus for DeFi projects, and expect to see several more projects launch around better smart contract auditing, precise runtime monitoring, and consumer protections.  Final thoughts  In sum, 2021 saw massive growth and an incredible number of innovations in the crypto sphere, ranging from blockchain infrastructure to DeFi to NFTs and more. Crypto has definitively asserted itself as one of the most powerful technologies of our time, offering unparalleled privacy, trustlessness, composability and decentralization, while the traditional web remains highly exploitative, monopolistic and fragmented.  The public has never been as fixated on crypto as it is today, and crypto’s growing mainstream adoption is likely to shape and accelerate the speed of innovation in the coming year. With this newfound attention, I’m incredibly excited to see how crypto captures more of the mainstream financial and digital sphere and becomes an even more robust, secure platform for powering how we interact with the web in 2022.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Paul Veradittakit,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2021/12/28/panteras-paul-veradittakits-2022-predictions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/78c84ce69db700f31f898e9d4a24f5e4a59bb56f-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Netflow Trend Is Changing To Inflows From Outflows As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, BTC netflows have once again started to move from a trend of net outflows to more inflows. The &apos;all exchanges netflow&apos; is an indicator that measures the net amount of Bitcoin entering or exiting wallets of all exchanges. The metric&apos;s value is calculated by simply taking the difference between the inflows and the outflows. When the indicator has negative values, it means outflows are overwhelming inflows as a net amount of BTC is being transferred out of exchanges. Investors usually withdraw their coins from exchanges for accumulation purposes. And so, such a trend can be bullish for the crypto. On the other hand, positive netflow values signify that a net amount of Bitcoin is being deposited into exchange wallets. Since holders generally move their crypto to exchanges for withdrawing to fiat or for purchasing altcoins with them, such values of the indicator may be bearish for the coin. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the BTC netflow over the course of 2021: Looks like BTC inflows are on the rise | Source: The Glassnode Week Onchain (Week 52) As you can see in the above graph, the netflows have been oscillating between the +5k BTC and -5k BTC li...",NEGATIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-bearish-signal-trend-again-outflows-inflows/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

A report titled “Trend and Progress of Banking in India 2020-21″ released on Tuesday elaborates on the thinking of the RBI on a CBDC.  In a major step away from the RBI’s stance in the past toward anything cryptocurrency-related, the report says, “In its basic form, a central bank digital currency (CBDC), provides a safe, robust and convenient alternative to physical cash. In comparison with existing forms of money, it can offer benefits to users in terms of liquidity, scalability, acceptance, ease of transactions with anonymity and faster settlement.”  The RBI is charting ways to implement a CBDC in phases and its initial recommendation is to ”adopt basic models initially, and test comprehensively so that they have minimal impact on monetary policy and the banking system.”  Read more: Indian Ruling Party-Aligned Group Takes Stance on Crypto Regulation  While the bank said it is concerned about the “dynamic impact” of a CBDC “on macroeconomic policy making,” the report points to “India’s progress in payment systems” and how that “will provide a useful backbone to make a state-of-the art CBDC available to its citizens and financial institutions.”  The report raises questions about several aspects of CBDCs including “design elements” that “need to be navigated before” a CBDC is introduced. The design elements include exploring the rollout and navigating “whether the CBDC would be general purpose and available for retail use (CBDC-R), or would it be for wholesale use (CBDC-W)?”  T Rabi Shankar, the RBI’s deputy governor, has stated that “two types of CBDC are in the works,” wholesale and retail, and that “a lot of work has been done” on the wholesale CBDC but that “the retail-based CBDC approval is more complicated and it will take some more time.” He also said that “the moment it is ready, whichever is ready first, we will release it for pilot testing.”  In the past, the RBI has sought a total ban on cryptocurrencies, arguing that a partial ban wouldn’t work. In April 2018, the RBI notified banks not to support or engage in crypto transactions, effectively banning crypto trade in India, until the Supreme Court overturned the ban two years later.  The Indian government’s current bill to regulate cryptocurrencies, a draft of which has not been made public, has also reportedly evolved from prohibiting “all private cryptocurrencies” while allowing “for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology,” to enabling cryptocurrency to be used as an asset, but banning its use as currency or payment.  CoinDesk has reported that India’s draft cryptocurrency bill probably won’t become law until after next year’s Budget Session ends in April, adding to uncertainty about the state of crypto regulation in the nation.",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/28/rbi-recommends-india-implement-basic-version-of-cbdc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/12025b35bf1f5d816cefc6764419ffe21296ca89-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375682,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9ePJ,1640707149,Solana Wallet Phantom Nixes Auction for iOS Beta Invites After Community Erupts,"UPDATE (Dec. 28, 17:11 UTC): This article has been updated to reflect Phantom’s restructuring of the beta access rollout.  Solana’s Phantom wallet nixed its plans to sell pricey NFT invites for its iOS beta Tuesday after taking heavy community criticism that it was effectively pricing people out with $1,600 access passes.  “We never meant to alienate anyone and never intended on profiting from the auction in any way,” Phantom, the crypto wallet company, said in a Twitter post. It said it had planned to donate the now-canceled mint proceeds to charity; it pledged to donate $200,000 to the organization Girls Who Code.  Phantom replaced its NFT sale with a “free” beta invite for 1,000 people, a sharp decline from the 7,000 planned non-fungible tokens. It was unclear if Phantom’s new plan would affect the app’s debut timeline, although the sign-up spots filled up within minutes.  The botched launch amounted to an embarrassing misstep by Phantom, a closed-source crypto wallet as prominent in Solanaland as MetaMask is for the Etherverse. An NFT project meant to be “fun” instead devolved into hours of drubbing on Twitter as users balked at paying as much as eight SOL to test out the app.  Signs of the storm were brewing Tuesday morning. A representative for Magic Eden, the NFT marketplace originally slated to conduct the access sale, told CoinDesk “We may be changing our approach to this drop” prior to this article’s original publication.  That the proceeds were earmarked for charity had little impact on the Solana community’s response. Some called for a boycott of the sale; others pledged to move their assets elsewhere. But paying eight SOL to access an unfinished product was clearly a nonstarter.  Phantom goes mobile  Demand for a Phantom mobile app has been simmering for months as the price of SOL, Solana’s native asset, surged.  Phantom boasted 1 million active users in November as the most popular crypto wallet for Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi). It became an ecosystem kingpin despite lacking a mobile app and held its throne even as competing apps such as Solflare launched theirs. The demand has been so heated that some overeager Phantom users have reported losing their wallet balances to opportunistic scammers who filled the void with phony apps.  Read more: Solana Wallets Phantom, Solflare Eye Mobile for Growth  Both companies (and leadership at the blockchain’s keystone stakeholder, Solana Labs) have called mobile wallet apps critical to the superfast network’s long-term growth.

42411600,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glP00i,1640703600,How Crypto’s Regulatory Scene Might Evolve in 2022,"The story of crypto is one of a global asset and technology class, and it’s one we intend to cover as comprehensively as possible. Here’s what CoinDesk’s new regulatory team is watching for next year.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Meet the team  The narrative  Hey folks. Happy holidays and congratulations on getting through 2020-lite! Next year promises to be fairly significant in terms of how the regulatory environment around digital assets will develop. To that end, CoinDesk’s brand new regulatory team is up and running and looking forward. I asked the team to share what they’re expecting.  Why it matters  CoinDesk is ramping up its efforts to cover the regulatory world’s intersection with the digital asset sector. To that end, we now have a global team composed of existing and new reporters dedicated to this very specific industry. Here’s what we’ll be watching for next year.  Breaking it down  Nikhilesh De (U.S.): The big issues I’m looking at in the U.S. are stablecoin regulation and the infrastructure bill. The stablecoin issue is most interesting to me – administration officials have said on multiple occasions that they want Congress to act on the President’s Working Group report. While the report suggests that the Financial Stability Oversight Council could draft regulations, even this interagency group is asking Congress to set the rules for stablecoin oversight in the U.S. The questions are whether Congress will act and if it does, what it rules will look like.  The infrastructure bill’s impact is likewise going to draw my attention, less for the tax provision itself and more as a symbol for when the industry started really getting politically engaged. We’ve had lobbyists and policy groups for years now, but this past August’s fight over a provision defining a “broker” really felt like a shift in terms of how the industry views Washington. We’re already seeing a greater number of congressional candidates who have ties to the crypto industry. I imagine we’ll soon start hearing more about political action committees (PACs) or other efforts to lobby candidates and bolster pro-crypto politicians.  What I’m very curious about is where things land up on the actual regulatory side. Will the Securities and Exchange Commission or Commodity Futures Trading Commission take oversight of crypto spot markets? Will one of these agencies issue guidance for startups trying to launch in the U.S.? Or will 2022 be a repeat of 2021 and 2020 and 2019 and so on where we hear speeches and see enforcement actions but not much more.  On a personal note, thanks for sticking through the first year of this newsletter. More to come!  Sandali Handagama (EU): In 2022, we’re going to hear a lot more about the European Union’s (EU) proposed framework for regulating crypto assets as the European Council and Parliament start negotiating the rules. The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework is broadly aimed at regulating virtual asset service providers and issuers. But there is an undeniable focus on policing the stablecoin sector, particularly stablecoins that resemble Facebook’s (now Meta)’s proposed stablecoin libra (now diem).  EU regulators also proposed a regulatory sandbox for projects based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) in 2020 that’s now awaiting parliamentary approval.  Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) is examining a digital euro for retail use. A number of European countries including Switzerland and France have also been part of experiments involving a wholesale digital euro as the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) continues to expand its work on central bank digital currencies around the world.  Cheyenne Ligon (U.S.): Virgil Griffith – the Ethereum developer who was charged with violating U.S. sanctions law after giving a talk on cryptocurrencies in North Korea – will be sentenced by a New York judge on Feb. 2. Griffith’s plea deal could see him serving between five and six and a half years in federal prison.  Griffith’s case is just one of many such court cases I expect to see play out next year. While the majority of them won’t be as high profile as Griffith’s, the explosive growth in the crypto industry means lawmakers and enforcement agencies are paying more attention to crypto crime.  In 2022, I expect to see an uptick in the number of criminal probes of crypto companies, charges brought against individual crypto scammers and enforcement actions and civil penalties from the SEC and CFTC as those agencies regulate crypto through enforcement.  Lavender Au (APAC): With South Korea’s presidential election in March, we are unlikely to see much regulatory action soon. But a new administration taking power could mean that the industry may finally see a promotion bill and investors may see the controversial crypto tax bill amended.  Japan launched a decentralized finance (DeFi) study group this year and we may see its findings next year. The country will also introduce legislation on stablecoins and wallet providers that engage in stablecoin transactions.  In China, the overall attitude toward cryptocurrency is now set, and it’s not friendly. Some entrepreneurs will leave the country and those who choose to remain will keep a low profile. Next year, we’ll see more enforcement, as local governments draw up more detailed regulation on crypto in their jurisdictions.  In Hong Kong, we may see the Securities and Futures Commission release specific legislation aimed at cryptocurrency late next year, insiders say.  Amitoj Singh (India): In the new year, CoinDesk will be closely watching the uncertain state of India’s cryptoverse, especially a crypto bill that hasn’t been introduced yet in parliament. CoinDesk will be monitoring how the bill evolves as lawmakers in India try to make it align with a global regulatory framework.  CoinDesk India will look at what risks the government sees in crypto and how it will try to mitigate those risks. Another issue is how crypto regulations will fit in with regulations of existing capital markets.  Other issues to look at next year include how crypto transactions will be taxed and how advertising in the crypto industry will be regulated.

42410931,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtSi9,1640700976,5 Ways Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Advanced in 2021,"Attention in Bitcoin in 2021 has been glued to El Salvador making history as the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender and bitcoin’s chronically fluctuating price. But behind the scenes, plenty of game-changing work is being done as well, such as developers working diligently to make Bitcoin a better payment system.  Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, which boosts Bitcoin payment’s speed and allows many, many more users the opportunity to send Bitcoin payments, is giving Bitcoin at least an inkling of a shot at mass adoption. And in 2021, as in every other year since the white paper was released in 2015, Lightning Network developers have been tinkering to make the technology more usable for more people.  Read the CoinDesk Research report: A Deep Dive Into Lightning as a Bitcoin Scaling Solution  With the help of this background grind, the network is swelling in use. The Lightning Network reeled in a record amount of bitcoin being used on the network. Twitter is even testing the technology to allow its users to send bitcoin tips to each other.  All that said, there’s still a lot of work to do to make the payment network easier to use, more secure and more private.  This is not an exhaustive list, since so much work is being poured into the technology, but here are a few key Lightning protocol developments that made headway this year.  Taproot happened on Bitcoin  This year, Lightning got a huge boost from the November activation of Taproot, the biggest change to Bitcoin in four years. Taproot’s addition of Schnorr signatures makes it possible to add new privacy improvements to Lightning.  Read more: How Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade Will Improve Technology Across Bitcoin’s Software Stack  But there’s still a lot of work ahead to make these privacy improvements a reality.  “While Taproot brings many privacy improvements to the table, there are a lot of other, unrelated updates to Lightning that are higher priority and orthogonal to it, and implementers are already struggling to find time to review and implement everything. Please be patient, Taproot is coming, but it will take time!” Lightning Network developer Bastien Teinturier writes.  That said, there are a few key ways Taproot can affect Lightning at various levels.  Bitcoin is abnormally transparent. All transactions are stored on a ledger, which anyone can easily browse through. Today, it’s generally easy to distinguish Lightning transactions from normal transactions, because the address format is a little different.  Taproot makes it possible (for the most part) to make Lightning transactions look indistinguishable from normal transactions, making it much less clear that the user is using the Lightning Network for their transactions.  Taproot could also pave the way for “Point Lock Time Contracts” (PTLCs). In short, the Lightning Network connects nodes from around the world, allowing payments to find a “path” across this network, hopping across several connected nodes. The beauty of PTLCs is they make it much harder for someone trying to trace a payment’s origin to link these various hops, shielding the path where a payment came from.  Even though there’s still a lot to do, it was a big step in 2021 to push Taproot through, making these changes possible.  Lightning liquidity boosts  One huge problem with the Lightning Network is inbound liquidity.  Read more: Lightning Network’s New Liquidity Marketplace Attracts a ‘Surprising’ Mix of Individuals, Enterprises  In order to receive money on Lightning, users need to either spend money first or find some other way of obtaining “inbound liquidity.” This is super confusing to newer users who just want to accept payments easily.  Developers have been cooking up different ways to make it easier to find and snag the required liquidity. In 2021, a number of tools emerged for dealing with this issue.  At the end of 2020, Lightning Labs introduced Pool, a marketplace for buying and selling this essential liquidity, giving developers a better interface for tracking it down. In 2021, Lightning Labs also unveiled “sidecar channels,” an easy way to also use the marketplace to help others get inbound liquidity easily – for a fee.  Additionally, Bitcoin tech startup Blockstream opened the first dual-funded channel on mainnet in May.  Without going into too much detail, the Lightning Network is composed of pathways called “channels” that are kind of like a bank account allowing users to send Lightning transactions. A Lightning channel is composed of two parties. Usually when such a channel is opened, only one side has funds. Dual-funded channels allow for both sides to add funds to the channel, opening up a way for both channel parties to be able to send and receive payments over the network immediately.  This year, Blockstream also introduced liquidity ads, which offer some of the same benefits as Lightning Labs’ Pool, but without a central middleman managing the infrastructure. Instead, liquidity ads bake in a way to advertise liquidity into the Lightning protocol. Nodes that are buying or selling liquidity can post advertisements that get relayed to the other nodes in the network in a decentralized marketplace.  Fee-bumping to the rescue  Another proposal in the works for the Lightning Network is paying fees when “closing” a channel. A user has to set an initial closing fee when they open the channel. But Bitcoin fees can fluctuate wildly. So, the fee a user decides to pay today could be too big or small for a transaction that closes, say, a year from now.  “Anchor outputs” is a feature concocted to make it possible to bump up such a fee. The Lightning Network’s three leading code implementations LND, C-lightning and Eclair all implemented anchor outputs in some form in 2021.  But even anchor inputs don’t solve the whole problem of closing fees. When a Lightning Network’s closing transaction fee gets bumped up, there’s a possible security issue. By way of a fee-bumping technique known as “Child Pays For Parent” (CPFP), a so-called “child” transaction pays too little for a fee, and so a “parent” transaction spends the same coins as the child it’s referring to, bumping up the fee. There’s a possible issue where, even if users try to bump up the fee, nodes might ignore the transaction if the parent transaction’s fee is still too small. In that scenario, the fee is not successfully bumped up, meaning the transaction doesn’t go through as fast as the user needs it to.  Package relay, a project steered by Bitcoin Core contributor Gloria Zhao, offers a way to get around this problem by packaging the parent and child transactions together, ensuring that these fee-bumping transactions are not ignored. The feature made a lot of progress this year, though it is not yet fully merged into the code base.  ‘Offers’ for a smoother Lightning user experience  The way Lightning payments are usually accepted is with an invoice – usually in the form of a QR code, the square-shaped barcode that can be scanned with a phone. It outlines the payment destination and amount of BTC to send. However, this invoice can be used only once. Thus, every time you want to receive a new Lightning transaction, you need to generate a new invoice. .  This is a different transaction flow than the one users experience on Bitcoin’s main chain, where they can post a static Bitcoin address to collect donations, for example. (Note: Address reuse is generally discouraged for privacy-related reasons.)  For the last couple of years, the ad hoc standard LNURL has offered a way around this issue so that a user could accept multiple payments using the same Lightning invoice.  But this year another proposal gained steam . It’s known as “offers,” championed by Blockstream Lightning developer Rusty Russell and standardized in BOLT 12. Developers disagree whether offers or LNURL is a better solution. One reason Russell is pushing for offers is that it potentially offers better privacy.  The proposal has gathered a lot of support. In addition to allowing multiple payments to the same address or QR code, offers will introduce a way to send recurring payments over the Lightning Network, such as a monthly payment to Netflix.  “[Offers] has seen a lot of progress and is a great improvement for the payment UX (user experience). I’m hoping that it will start being deployed in early 2022,” Teinturier told CoinDesk.  C-lightning offers experimental support of offers. The project still needs to be standardized across the different Lightning implementations.  Improved payment routing reliability  Another issue is the reliability of Lightning payments. Payments don’t always go through properly, especially if they’re larger payments. Lightning researchers Rene Pickhardt and Stefan Richter published a paper describing a nifty new routing method that could improve reliability of Lightning payments.  In short, a Lightning payment needs to bounce across multiple nodes in order to reach its destination, such as a merchant who accepts Lightning payments for a cup of coffee. Because these hops have some privacy built in, the balance distribution of the channels is hidden. Therefore, it can be tricky to find a path that has enough capacity in it to support the payment all the way – especially for larger payments. The average Lightning channel capacity is currently around $2,033, meaning if you want to send payments above that amount, it will be more difficult to find a consistent path across the network.  Today, the algorithm in Lightning focuses on finding the cheapest route for the user in terms of fees. But while this is good from the perspective of finding cheap channels, it’s more likely to pick a path that fails. Pickhardt and Richter take another approach: They look at the probability a payment will succeed based on the size of the channels in the path, while also considering the cheapest options in terms of fees.  C-lightning has implemented an experimental first version of the new routing mechanism, which has successfully routed payments more reliably, as the authors of the paper hypothesized.  With all these changes in the mix, Lightning is growing easier to use, as well as more reliable and private. In 2022, Lightning developers are looking to build upon these changes in the hopes that they trickle down to help everyday Lightning payment users.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2021/12/28/how-bitcoins-lightning-network-advanced-in-2021,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09b6789ddfcd9f7dcd019c9273855a28a22985d0-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization failed to break the $52,000 level on Monday and slipped to $49,300 in European trading hours on Tuesday.  Bitcoin prices have fallen almost $20,000 since November 2021′s highs of over $69,000. However, analytics show the supply held by investors has only dropped to 13.3 million BTC from 13.4 million BTC – a marginal change considering the massive price drop.  The absorption of bitcoin from sellers could be bullish.  “Such on-chain behavior is more typically observed during bitcoin bear markets, which in hindsight are effectively lengthy periods of coin redistribution from weaker hands, to those with stronger, and longer-term conviction,” explained Glassnode in a Monday newsletter.  Glassnode categorizes long-term holders as wallet addresses holding bitcoin greater than a 155-day period – a time frame beyond which holders are statistically less likely to spend their bitcoins.  The recent reduction in long-term holdings looks like a rounding error compared with what investors added in 2021. Data shows long-term holders have added 1.8 million bitcoin to their accounts since January while short-term supply declined by 1.4 million bitcoin in the same period.  Some long-term holders haven’t touched their bitcoin in over five years, with over 23% of bitcoin’s 21 million supply remaining untouched in the period, as per other metrics tracked by Glassnode.  Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a price-chart indicator, for bitcoin slid to favorable levels in European trading hours on Tuesday after reaching overbought conditions last Friday. The tool calculates market momentum for assets, and an overbought level implies prices are overvalued and may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective price pullback.  RSI readings for bitcoin hovered at 40 on Tuesday after reaching an overbought level of over 72 on Friday, when prices touched $51,000.

Leading losses among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization were Polkadot’s DOT tokens, which fell 8% in 24 hours after being a top gainer on Sunday. Others such as solana (SOL), cardano (ADA) and XRP averaged losses of 3.4%, while binance coins (BNB) gained 0.4%.  A catalyst for DOT’s upward price movement last week was the start of the second batch of parachain auctions on the Polkadot network. Parachains are distinct blockchains that run atop the main Polkadot network. Polkadot, however, has a limited number of openings available. To gain access, a parachain has to win a community-run auction that uses DOT to vote for slots, leading to increased demand for the cryptocurrency.  DOT surged to over $32 on Monday, but traders have since taken profits and the tokens exchanged hands for $28 in Asian trading hours on Tuesday. They are, however, still 20% higher than last Tuesday.  Prices slipped, falling below the 34-day moving average – a tool used to determine market trends using past prices – in Asian trading hours Tuesday. Failing to trade above the moving average indicates DOT’s decline from $54 highs in November is likely to continue.  Other big losers among large-cap cryptocurrencies were tokens of decentralized payments network Terra (LUNA) and Ethereum scaling solution Polygon (MATIC), with both sliding 7% in the past 24 hours.  Tokens of the two surged in the past week following favorable catalysts: decentralized finance (DeFi) activity rose on Terra as crypto investors bet on the network as the next DeFi play, while the launch of top Ethereum-based exchange Uniswap on Polygon saw demand for MATIC increase.  Ethereum rivals, gaming cryptos fall  Outside of the top 20, tokens of Ethereum rival blockchains took hits. Near (NEAR) and Cosmos (ATOM) – which surged last week as traders searched for the next ecosystem that could replicate Ethereum’s success – slid 8%, while Fantom (FTM) dropped as much as 9% in the past 24 hours, data from CoinGecko showed.  Gaming-related cryptocurrencies were another losing sector. Gala (GALA) tokens declined 7%, while fan-favorites Axie Infinity (AXS) and The Sandbox (SAND) both lost 4.4% following record surges in the past few months.",NEGATIVE,DOT,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/28/polkadot-leads-altcoin-losses-after-bitcoin-is-rejected-at-52k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fa7d8b0f90a7b7d9f7b84135a6959143847422e4-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375683,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9eQZ,1640689350,Crypto Futures See $300M in Losses After Spot Market Drops,"A drop in crypto markets from Monday evening (UTC) prompted almost $300 million in liquidations across several crypto futures contracts, data from analytics tool Coinglass showed. More than 109,000 traders’ positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours.  Bitcoin prices rose above $52,000 on Monday before tumbling by as much as $3,000 early Tuesday, causing over $94 million in liquidations. Such figures were last seen earlier this month after bitcoin fell to as low as $41,000 from highs of around $69,000 in November. Losses due to liquidations exceeded $435 million at the time.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. They happen primarily in futures trading, which only tracks asset prices, as opposed to spot trading, where traders own the actual assets.  Nearly 80% of the $300 million in liquidations occurred on long positions, which are futures contracts in which traders bet on a price rise. Crypto exchange Binance saw $119 million in liquidations, the most among major exchanges, while traders on FTX took on $78 million in losses.  Futures on ether, the native currency of the Ethereum network, saw over $57 million in liquidations. Losses on altcoin futures were lower, with Solana (SOL) and Terra (LUNA) traders taking on slightly over $9 million in losses. The relatively smaller liquidation figures for altcoins compared with bitcoin imply recent price surges for SOL and LUNA were driven mainly by spot trading.  Open interest – the total number of unsettled futures or derivatives – for bitcoin fell 0.2% despite the losses, implying little money flowed out of the market despite the drop.  Data from Coinglass shows $19 billion worth of futures positions on bitcoin remain open in the last week of 2021 and $11 billion worth on ether futures. The figures are several times higher than those for altcoins, with only solana futures carrying an open interest of over $1 billion into 2022 among large-cap cryptos.",NEGATIVE,SOL,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/28/crypto-futures-see-300m-in-losses-after-spot-market-drops,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b44ca043c41143faecbf1900195eb523d6a494c-1500x1037.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
