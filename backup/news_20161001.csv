42378841,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mEtb,1475338624,Why Blockchain Won’t Disrupt Banks First,"Oliver Bussmann is a FinTech advisor and former group CIO of UBS, and Nick Williamson is the CEO and founder of custom blockchain provider Credits.  In this opinion piece, the authors argue that, despite the promise that blockchain solutions hold for the banking industry, the sector will not be first to put the burgeoning technology into real-world action.  As two people who have been working closely with blockchain for a while now, we have no doubt about the technology’s potential to radically transform the financial industry.  A far better way to build and maintain interconnected ledgers – the heart of the financial system – it seems predestined for the job.  But while banks and FinTech companies around the world are busy developing blockchain-based solutions, we are likely to see blockchain “go live” in other industries first.  This is something of a paradox, and so we think worth a closer look.  Regulation, regulation, regulation  As Oliver can attest from his own experience, the main drag on implementing innovation in financial services is regulation.  As part of one of the most highly regulated sectors in the world, banks will need to wait for regulatory certainty on any number of issues before they can release blockchain-based platforms. Stringent rules regarding collecting, storing and sharing customer data add layers of rigorous validation, verification and internal sign-off on top of the regulatory approval.  Even though many regulators are actively supporting banks in exploring blockchain, this is simply not an environment geared to early adoption in the wild.  The fact that banks are coping with dwindling IT budgets, as well as heavy legacy IT investment, is an obstacle as well. As to an extent are legacy mindsets: The financial industry is heavily invested in centralized models; blockchain represents the opposite worldview.  More fertile ground  We believe blockchain will be implemented first in more lightly regulated sectors, particularly those which face challenges in managing data access control and ensuring data integrity. This can be sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) such as healthcare records, competitive secrets or other internal corporate data. Or it could be intellectual property, as with managing copyright for music or art.  Areas poised for takeoff include e-government, supply chain management and finance, insurance, real estate and the Internet of Things. BHP Billiton’s announcement last week that it was using blockchain to improve its supply chain processes is a perfect example of how this is already happening.  Useful use cases for all  At Credits, Nick has been observing this trend closely too. The company has been exploring a number of use cases outside of financial services, such as proof of identity, procurement processes, and interdepartmental payments. It recently worked with a client on a corporate identity blockchain solution.  Credits has also been very active in e-government, where blockchain has the potential to inject trust and accountability into many processes. This includes providing means to share sensitive personal data between departments that prevents data leaks while still allowing for data integrity checks.  The good news for banks is that many of the non-financial use cases also provide compelling first customers for the eventual financial ones. If we can solve supply chain management, for example, than we are not far from solving supply chain finance.  So while we may not see distributed ledgers taking over in financial services right away, that shouldn’t be interpreted as meaning it will never happen.  When it comes to blockchain and banks, there is no escaping destiny.

42378856,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mFBD,1475333952,Bitcoin Defender Speaks Out at London Blockchain Event,"Simon Dixon, CEO of the online investment platform BnktotheFuture.com outlined his vision for blockchain startups recently at The Internet of Value: Blockchain and Financial Services Innovation conference in London.  Making the conference keynote, Dixon laid out the history of bitcoin and blockchain companies, especially those working in the financial services sector, and what he considers lies ahead for the rapidly evolving industry.  Dixon’s take as a venture capitalist comes at a crucial time in the industry, which is grappling with making sense of the growing ecosystem of bitcoin, ethereum, cryptocurrencies, digital assets, and private blockchains.  Many early bitcoin startups have now pivoted into the private blockchain space, and several high-profile venture deals highlight the growing private blockchain industry.  However, the debate is far from over, and as recently as Sibos, participants were divided on whether public blockchains can be used for financial applications like securities markets:    The audience at #sibos2016 just participated in this real-time vote. pic.twitter.com/SS0ZcKztsn        — Michael del Castillo (@DelRayMan) September 28, 2016      One chain to rule them all  Speaking to a packed room of bankers and FinTech entrepreneurs, Dixon said he believes that bitcoin is now the only viable blockchain that has proven its utility at scale, and that banks looking to build other ‘private blockchains’ will end up either using bitcoin or other non-blockchain technologies, such as distributed databases or other solutions.  Further, Dixon defined what is needed to justify the use of a blockchain:  “Blockchain introduces bearer assets. If there is no need of bearer assets, then there is no need for a blockchain. However, bearer assets carry risks, like hacking risk.”  Banks and financial institutions seldom need or desire to give up their control with the creation of bearer assets – as opposed to the current models where they retain custody, he added. In such cases, banks will end up using distributed ledgers that are just databases, instead of true blockchains.  The CEO further delved into the history of the space and its current terminology, saying at one point that venture capitalists that had invested in bitcoin wanted to get the banks on board.  Considering that bitcoin was ‘tainted’ in the media thanks to its associations with drugs and hacking, the venture capitalists apparently pitched the banks on the use of blockchain. The ""buy"" side became interested in blockchain technology after Blythe Masters and her firm Digital Asset Holdings raised the appeal of the tech with Wall Street institutions.  However there is only one blockchain that works at scale, he stressed, and that is bitcoin.  Appealing to the extremes  Looking to the future, Dixon suggested that startups focus their efforts on those applications that have the most utility.  When it comes to bitcoin, he said, there are two disparate sections of populations that will find the most value going forward.  On the one hand there are the ultra-wealthy, who invest in bitcoin as a hedge against bank deposits, therefore utilizing bitcoin as a store of value. On the other, are the poorest four billion or so of the world population who are underserved by the current banking system and could use bitcoin as a means of value transmission in applications like remittances.  However, the first wave of bitcoin startups, like payment processor Bitpay, largely targeted the middle sector of the population, which is neither ultra-wealthy nor unbanked, he said.  This segment of the population didn’t have a compelling case to use bitcoin for everyday transactions, and so the tech failed to really take off, even after gaining initial traction. Now, Dixon said, his company is investing in startups that cater to either end of the spectrum, and avoiding the middle.  Moving on, Dixon said the interest of central banks in issuing digital currencies is a radical change in the relationship between central bank, money, and the financial industry.  Such digital currencies, that don’t need to rely on a blockchain, would be issued directly by the central banks without involving the banking system, and would not be backed by debt.  Digital currencies issued by a central bank would represent a way to reduce systemic risk in the financial sector and are likely to become more prominent during financial crises, he said. Investors would then be able to transact directly with central bank-issued digital currencies and bitcoin, thus cutting out the wider banking sector altogether.  Addressing other use cases that are traditionally touted by the financial industry as requiring private blockchains, Dixon believes most such instances could be addressed using traditional or distributed databases rather than blockchains.  Further, many such problems are not really technological problems, he suggested – for example, the hurdle to overcome when bringing about instant settlement of payments is a ""compliance problem"" rather than a technical one.
