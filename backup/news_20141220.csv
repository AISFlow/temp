42398094,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbM9yN,1419103909,Why Bitcoin Apps and Bitcoin Speculators Need Each Other,"Adam Ludwin co-founded Chain.com, a bitcoin developer platform. Prior to Chain, Adam was a venture investor in companies including Vine, Slack, Kik and Paperless Post. He holds a B.S. from UC Berkeley and an MBA from Harvard.  Here’s one way of looking at the bitcoin market:  Miners mint new bitcoins  Speculators buy/sell them  The price of bitcoin is affected  Miners with a marginal cost lower than the price of bitcoin keep mining  Here’s a visual representation of that story:  But is this the complete picture?  After all, new bitcoins aren’t the only thing that miners create.  Their competition with one another to mine the next block (and receive the current reward of 25 freshly minted bitcoins for doing so) also produces, by design, a secure financial network: one which is open, decentralized, programmable, and very inexpensive to use. The beekeeper gets honey, and the rest of us get flowers.  So here’s the other half of the story which completes the picture:  Miners create a secure network  Because it is open and programmable, apps and services are built on this network, driving demand for bitcoin  The price of bitcoin is affected  Miners with a marginal cost lower than the price of bitcoin keep mining  Here’s how it looks together:  What can we learn from looking at the system as a whole?  Without speculators, there would be no bitcoin. They provide miners, applications, and other participants with liquidity. If you have bought or sold bitcoin as a speculator, you have helped enable the emerging ecosystem of bitcoin apps. While speculative bubbles will swell and pop from time to time (see: 2013-2014), this does not change the underlying value of the network or the possibilities for the protocol.  Bitcoin-enabled apps and services are the main driver of underlying demand for bitcoin, and as a result, the main driver of the price of bitcoin, since the supply of bitcoin is fixed. But it will take time to see the effect. It is much faster and easier to place a buy/sell order than it is to build a bitcoin-enabled service. Still, 2014 saw the emergence of the first wave of these apps, enabled in large part by services like Chain, which significantly reduce the cycle time for building them. As these services grow, and more services come online, the price of bitcoin will steadily rise.  But what about price volatility? Whether volatility increases or decreases, one thing is likely to be true: it won’t matter as much going forward as people think. Why is that? Because bitcoin apps will increasingly hedge their users’ exposure to price volatility, thanks again to the speculators, who want leveraged exposure to bitcoin. In other words, the only people that will experience bitcoin volatility will be those who choose to. This is no different than any other financial market comprised of hedgers and speculators, except for the important fact that it is likely even easier, cheaper, and more efficient to hedge using the block chain and smart contracts than it is in other markets.  tl;dr: Miner’s main output is a secure network, apps will be the main driver of bitcoin’s price, speculators are healthy, and volatility should not be feared.

42398088,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbM9tS,1419095713,Dispute Breaks Out Over Title of 'First Regulated Bitcoin Hedge Fund',"In July, a hedge fund in Jersey issued a press release announcing that it had become the first regulated fund to deal in bitcoin.  The Jersey fund, called Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI), later said it was seeking $200m in assets under management. In subsequent months, mentions of GABI have been regularly prefaced by its status as the first regulated bitcoin hedge fund by everyone from the BBC to Newsweek.  Now another hedge fund is challenging GABI's claim. Crypto Currency Fund, managed by Timothy Enneking, says that it, not GABI, should rightfully be referred to as the world's first regulated fund for digital currencies.  Enneking says his fund has formally traded exclusively in digital currencies on 1st April 2014. It also changed its name to Crypto Currency Fund (CCF) on this date. It operated under the name Tera Capital Fund before this. Enneking's fund is regulated by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA).  Notably, Crypto Currency Fund claims returns of 392% for its investors in 2013.  Why come forward now?  A check with CIMA confirmed Enneking's dates. Crypto Currency Fund's name change in April puts it two months ahead of GABI's July press release. So why is Enneking coming forward now, four months after GABI announced itself to the world?  While wanting to establish a track record before making his vehicle known to the public, Enneking also sought to avoid the appearance of peddling 'vapourware' – products and services that are announced before they are ready to be launched on the market – which plagues the bitcoin industry.  ""GABI and all these other funds that are claiming to the first this and the first that ... the first bitcoin hedge fund, whether regulated or not, is very clearly the Crypto Currency Fund,"" Enneking said. ""I think it's important to be first.""  Being first isn't just a matter of principle, though. Enneking admitted that while his fund had $6.6m under management, he is seeking to expand, and therefore is looking for more investors to park their money with him.  Enneking said CCF is branching out into 'managed portfolios', where traders who manage the fund's money can also be tasked to oversee an individual investors' portfolio independently of the fund. He added that more products are in the works.  ""We have nice [assets under management], we've had it since the beginning, but of course we're looking for more funds to manage,"" he said.  Delving into history  Crypto Currency Fund started life as the Tera Capital Fund, which was set up in 2005 and focused on Russia's markets. Tera was managed by Altima Asset Management, the fund management company that Enneking runs.  While Enneking was running Altima, he was also engaged by a firm called Exante to do ""international marketing"" for its new vehicle, a digital currency fund named Bitcoin Fund. That Malta-based fund launched in late 2012.  Enneking contends that Bitcoin Fund was indeed the first fund dealing in bitcoin, although it functioned as a passive index fund tracking the price of bitcoin, thus disqualifying it from the race for the title of the first bitcoin hedge fund, which requires active management of investor money.  Around the same time, Enneking decided to get out of the Russian market. By June 2013, Tera was no longer trading in assets linked to Russia. Enneking said the fund began dabbling in bitcoin markets at this time, leading up to the fund's rechristening as Crypto Currency Fund in April 2014.  With CCF officially named in April and GABI issuing its press release in July, it would appear that the claim to the title is settled. Well, not quite, if GABI has anything to do with the matter.  GABI's response  When CoinDesk contacted the Jersey fund to put Enneking's claim to it, it responded with a statement from its compliance department. It attached a screenshot of incorporation records from Jersey's Companies Registry, showing that it was incorporated on 12th March 2014, in other words, 19 days before CCF gained its current name. A check at the registry confirmed the date.  ""GABI was incorporated on 12th March 2014 and was therefore the first regulated fund ... we are not aware of Mr Enneking being regulated as investment managers in any jurisdiction,"" GABI's compliance department wrote.  GABI had more to say too. In the fund's view, the standard of oversight supplied by the Cayman Islands financial regulator is too low to be compared to the rigorous rules enforced on Jersey.  The Jersey fund pointed to the fact that in Jersey, ""every aspect"" of the fund was overseen by the regulator. This includes all business relationships the fund enters into. The compliance department letter also detailed other aspects of governance by Jersey, including ""stringent"" money-laundering checks before bitcoin supply sources are approved and reviews of operational procedures before regulatory approval.  Fair comparison?  Comparing regulation on the Cayman Islands to that on Jersey, therefore, was not appropriate, GABI said.  GABI wrote:  ""To compare CIMA Mutual Fund Law with Jersey FSC's Expert Fund Regime is therefore not comparing like with like and few investors would believe that CIMA's form of 'regulation' afforded them much if any protection beyond that offered by the fact that the investment manager is regulated somewhere.""  Two firms that consult hedge funds on jurisdiction and other matters that CoinDesk contacted didn't seem to agree with GABI's assessment of the Cayman Islands.  When asked about the differences in regulation between the Caymans and Jersey, Aaron Kaplan, a lawyer with New York firm Gusrae Kaplanhttp://www.gusraekaplan.com/about/index, said his firm's experience of the Cayman Islands demonstrated that it had a ""competent"" court system and structure of law.  Delivering the goods  Elizabeth Tansell, a senior manager for business development with SMP Partners, a consultant on fund administration and tax matters headquartered on the Isle of Man, noted that operators of a Cayman registered fund are subject to reporting requirements. These include regulatory returns filed annually and prompt notification to investors of material changes to the fund.  So, who is the first regulated bitcoin hedge fund? While the incorporation records show GABI clearly beating CCF in creating a vehicle dedicated to bitcoin trading, Enneking can point to the fact that his fund had been trading in the cryptocurrency for 10 months prior, albeit under a different name and not exclusively dealing in digital currencies.  But perhaps the question of who's first is less important than the question of which vehicle will deliver the goods for their investors.  As Tansell points out: ""No matter what regulations you have in place, if the board doesn't fulfil its function and duties, there is still an opportunity for things to go wrong.""  UPDATE (20th December, 22:58 GMT): Tera Capital Fund was set up in 2005, not 1995, as originally stated. The fund's website stated the wrong founding year. CIMA records confirm it was founded in 2005.

42398090,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbM9wP,1419089421,What Bitcoin Can Learn From Mobile Money's Journey,"Sarah Boone Martin is founder of Rock the Coin, an organisation that engages in grassroots community outreach about bitcoin. She is also CEO of Boone Martin, a global communications firm that focuses on social impact investing.  Many of the greatest challenges faced by bitcoin today – adoption, scale and regulation – mirror those of its predecessor: mobile money.  When launched in 2007, mobile money was just as foreign and raised as much alarm as bitcoin. Though it has since spread to 60 million active users, mobile money was not an overnight success. However, we now have seven years of data about its achievements and failures that we can learn from and use to shape the choices made by those in the bitcoin sphere.  Emerging markets  Research on mobile money  focuses on emerging markets, where use is concentrated and most people don’t have formal bank accounts. Digital finance has proliferated in these regions because it’s easier to roll out mobile networks than shore up information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure.  Kenya has become the paragon of mobile money. Today, more than two-thirds of Kenyans use M-Pesa.  Why did this work and what are the lingering issues and opportunities for bitcoin?  Why M-Pesa worked  The M-Pesa phenomenon is a product of a unique regulatory environment. The service's developer, Safaricom, understood that partnering with the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) was paramount to its success and actively engaged regulators as part of its go-to-market strategy.  Since nothing like mobile money had ever existed previously, and there were no relevant guidelines, Safaricom designed its own AML/KYC and consumer protections. It then coordinated with the CBK to secure a non-banking license. These early efforts ultimately paved the way for a long-term working relationship.  Tanzania adopted a similar 'test and learn' approach to mobile money and today processes $1.8bn in transactions each month. By contrast, mobile money has lagged in India and Nigeria, both of which are known for their more complex bureaucracies.  Collaboration is the takeaway here. Creating a flexible, but safe regulatory space made the difference in Kenya and Tanzania. We’ve seen this type of engagement in the US (New York, CFTC) and around the world (the UK, Australia, Canada). Continued coordination with policymakers and openness to partnership may foster more enabling environments.  How long it takes to make money  Mobile network operators (MNOs) make little profit on mobile money (0.5% total GSM revenue) during the first two years. This is when operational expenses for marketing new products and supporting agent networks can be crushing.  From years three to five, MNOs yield modest profits (2–5% total revenue). At this point, companies have enough users to cover costs and can start promoting digital wallet-based services.  After year five, MNOs produce healthy profits (15–20% total revenue). By then, customers graduate from basic peer-to-peer transfers and immediate cash-outs, and begin using more lucrative services, like salary disbursements and bill payments.  Clearly the message here is that mobile money is a long game and most bitcoin startups accept this applies to them too. Note, however, this data depicts trends in one industry and is not necessarily predictive of outcomes for any other.  Why 'KYC' determines success or failure  Research shows that MNOs often miscalculate country context and overestimate financial and product literacy. Customers report problems navigating menus, which can shift across phones and may be written in formal, instead of colloquial, language.  Researchers also find that customers forget PINs and readily give phones or passcodes to agents to withdraw their cash. Tech problems like frozen screens, session timeouts and denial of service are all also big issues. Combined, these failures not only frustrate customers, but also lead to system mistrust and more frequent cash-outs.  For bitcoin businesses, knowing your customer takes on a different meaning here. Understanding what the customer wants and how the service will benefit their daily lives is essential; so too is piloting a product on the ground.  Connectivity in emerging markets can be spotty and statistics about mobile use can be misleading. For example, women typically have less access to mobile phones, but control the family finances and make the spending decisions. Overlooking this group means missing out on the primary money managers.  Bitcoin benefits from greater familiarity with digital money and mobile banking today. However, to increase financial literacy, the industry could adopt new guidelines, such as those developed by the GSM Association. These set basic standards for consumer information and education.  The biggest problems  Hot topics include interoperability, digitization, and regulation. MNOs typically run closed systems, but operators are having trouble scaling and cannot cross borders.  Indonesia  was the first to interlink schemes in an effort to expand the overall consumer base and promote in-network transactions.  Cash-outs are costly and research shows that electronic payments are more secure and efficient. Despite these findings and high-level support for a digitized economy, however, regulators still struggle to keep pace with new multiparty systems and product developments.  Interoperability and international transfers are immediate advantages for bitcoin. But we also share common issues with regulators as well as an interest transitioning to a cash-lite society. To improve our outreach efforts, we could join larger research and advocacy coalitions, like The Better Than Cash Alliance and GSMA, which maintain productive relationships with key decision makers.  The bottom line  Research shows that there is clear demand for faster, cheaper, and more transparent financial services. But it also underscores that products have to be easy to use and work all the time.  Bitcoin startups benefit from auspicious timing when world leaders are eager for better banking ideas and tech-based solutions. The truly innovative will be those who see the whole picture and build new products from the bottom up.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,Sarah Boone Martin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/12/20/what-bitcoin-can-learn-from-mobile-moneys-journey,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a026986cc5f32277e6447598e3d4907effcc547f-1456x971.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398084,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbM9nY,1419035861,Charlie Shrem Saga Ends With Two-Year Sentence in New York Court,"Former BitInstant CEO and Bitcoin Foundation board member Charlie Shrem was sentenced this afternoon to two years in prison after pleading guilty to aiding and abetting the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business.  Shrem will also serve three years of supervised release in addition to the prison sentence.  Judge Jed Rakoff, who presided over the case, rejected the defense's plea for probation only, but stopped short of imposing a harsher sentence based on the charges at hand.  Shrem acknowledged the illegality of his actions, stating in court:  “I have no excuses for what I did. I broke the law and I broke it badly.""    A shorter sentence    In September, Shrem agreed to a forefeiture of $950,000 as part of a plea bargain that would provide a jail term of up to 60 months, three years longer than the sentence he received today.  Defense counsel Marc Agnifilo appealed for Rakoff to consider the significance of Shrem's age, maturity and experience today and when he committed his illicit actions when issuing the ruling. Shrem was 22 years old at the time of the crime, and is 25 years old today.  BitInstant processed almost 50,000 orders in its time, Agnifilo said, but Shrem only violated his anti-money laundering (AML) duties at the company through his actions with co-accused Robert Faiella, who allegedly ran a bitcoin exchange service on Silk Road using the alias 'BTCKing'.  Agnifilo added that Shrem has committed no further offenses in the 15 months since he ended his communication with Faiella. Further, he noted that Shrem has made himself available to help community members and regulators looking to help grow the bitcoin ecosystem.  However, the prosecutor, US attorney Serrin Turner, said he found little to no distinction between the actions of both Shrem and Faiella, arguing that both crimes led to serious drug trafficking; that he was “moving drug money – not in the traditional way – online – but moving it nevertheless”.  The humanistic aspect  Throughout the hearing, Agnifilo addressed the use of human beings as tools to attain social policy, as he argued that the length of the sentence should not be more significant than the certainty of being caught.  Rakoff made the same distinction. Although the sentence must be sufficient, he said, sentences should not “be of such length that [they] destroy a man” or fail to account for his more laudable qualities.  “Short prison time has much of the general effect of long prison time,” he added.  Rakoff also called Americans “highly moralistic” which gives them a tendency to take pleasure in high sentences that “fail to take into account the human being”.  For that reason, he said the sentencing guidelines are “irrational and silly” and “not worthy of consideration” since they would recommend a “bizarre” sentence greater than what Congress would give.  Playing by the rules  The case against Shrem has been a beacon to bitcoin community businesses warning them about the significance of regulatory compliance and following the rules of the game, which was also a theme that arose during court.  Agnifilo said:    “This is the big leagues now, this is American business. To be an American business means to be a grownup, follow the rules. That message is loud and clear.”    Shrem stated that he can play a role in preventing further abuses in the digital currency space, arguing:    “No one [in bitcoin] is doing this anymore, they’re terrified … Bitcoin needs to stay away from criminals, from people taking actions that I did […] I need to be out there … helping the world to make sure they don't do a stupid thing like I did.”    Agnifilo later said that this case is a tremendous part of what will make bitcoin succeed, citing some of the applications that the digital currency and technology offers the global population and how much the ecosystem has evolved in its short life.  He also said that while he admittedly knows little about bitcoin, he’s certain that “if it gets too close to criminals, it’s not going anywhere, it’s going to die”, and that the only way it can live up to its true potential is to get criminals out of it.  Drug buyers vs drug dealers  Addressing Turner, Rakoff commented that there is a difference between helping drug users who may be drug addicts get their fix and helping drug dealers promote their products. The former, he said, is not as morally repellent as the latter.  Rakoff continued by saying that addicts are victims, and even though they may have contributed to their own victimization, they’ll go through any measure to get their fix and that one “can’t help but feel like they should be the object of some sympathy”.  On the contrary, “drug dealers are among the most repulsive human being that can be encountered,” Rakoff said, adding that Congress has said for many years “that we can’t end drug trafficking without getting into the economics of it”.  The sentence, he concluded on the matter, should therefore be directed at the moral quality of someone who enters into the situation that Shrem did.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/12/20/charlie-shrem-saga-ends-with-two-year-sentence-in-new-york-court,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/771ba45392fef6d07c65738322580fe08670e7ce-1741x846.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
