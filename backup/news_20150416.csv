42378164,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MLEx,1429219817,US Presidential Candidate Rand Paul to Appear at Bitcoin Event,"Kentucky Senator and Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul is set to appear at a digital currency-focused event in New York City this weekend.  To be held on 19th April at the private venue Union League Club, the event will be hosted by Blockchain Technologies Corp, a startup incubator associated with Bitcoin Center NYC.  Paul made headlines earlier this month when he became the first presidential candidate in the 2016 race to begin accepting bitcoin donations. The announcement sparked debate among commentators divided as to whether Paul stands to gain from embracing digital currency or if other candidates would follow his lead to accept bitcoin donations.  The Union League Club, founded in 1863, has long been associated with influential US figures, having played host to a number of current or expected presidential candidates in recent months.  In January, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush spoke at an event at the clubhouse, while Texas Senator Ted Cruz spoke at the venue in March.  The news was first revealed via a press release by Blockchain Technologies Corp.  A spokesperson for the Paul campaign was not available for comment, while the Union League Club suggested it was unable to verify anticipated attendees for private functions.

42378157,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ML7P,1429209616,NYDFS Expects Final BitLicense 'Very Soon',"The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) suggests it is moving steadily toward the release of a finalized BitLicense under which digital currency businesses would be regulated in the state.  Following the end of a comment period in late March, NYDFS deputy superintendent for public affairs Matt Anderson indicated that the NYDFS is processing responses from its final round of open community feedback.  Anderson told CoinDesk:  ""We take some time to review the comments for potential changes or modifications, and hopefully [will] publish a final rule soon.""  Anderson suggested that the NYDFS is currently reviewing the comments and redacting sensitive information related to commenters. Second-round comments could possibly be released at the time the final regulation is made public, he added.  The finalized BitLicense has been long expected since it was first proposed at the end of 2013. Throughout 2014, superintendent Benjamin Lawsky expressed hope that the regulatory process be completed quickly.  In recent weeks, New York's proposed regulation has come under fire from the digital currency industry and beyond in the face of what has been perceived as more lenient regulation being developed in the United Kingdom.  Though no formal time was given for the release, Anderson stressed that the final version of the BitLicense would be out ""very soon"".  ""We're trying to work expeditiously, but we're not trying to work toward any particular date,"" he said.

42378153,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ML2N,1429204122,"Alex Winter Talks Bitcoin, Drugs and His New Film 'Deep Web'","CoinDesk managing editor Emily Spaven interviews director Alex Winter ahead of the release of his new documentary film Deep Web.  Libertarian ideals, crime and citizens' rights in the digital age – there are many themes running through Alex Winter's latest documentary film, Deep Web, but by far the greatest focus is the story of Ross Ulbricht and his involvement in the online drugs marketplace Silk Road.  Winter, best known for his role as Bill Preston in the Bill and Ted franchise, has long since proved his worth on the other side of the lens, having sat in the director's chair on five films since 1993.  His latest offering begins with a rousing speech by British libertarian and cypherpunk Amir Taaki, warning of corrupt fascists masquerading as ""white knights"". Taaki enthuses that now is the time for the technological classes to take back their sovereignty.  The movie goes on to explore the mysterious underbelly of the Internet – the hidden layer called the Deep Web and its anonymity-rich area: the Dark Net.  It's here that illegal drug marketplaces exist and where Ulbricht's story begins.  The film focuses on the arrest of Ulbricht, the charges made against him for his involvement in the creation and operation of Silk Road and the court case centred on these allegations.  Along the way, Deep Web introduces a number of people, ranging from Ulbricht's mother, a childhood friend and a former law enforcement professional, to his defence lawyer, an anonymous Silk Road drugs vendor and an anti-prohibition campaigner.  The human angle  Winter explained the film was initially to be centred broadly on bitcoin, the Dark Net and the revolutionary ideas behind cryptography, encryption and cryptocurrencies, however this soon changed.  ""As the Silk Road story and Ross’s story evolved, it became really clear that the human story was the most important – he put his life on the line,"" he said, adding:  ""The guy is facing the rest of his life in jail. I think it's important to think about Ross Ulbricht – whatever you think about his guilt or innocence – you have to reflect on this human being's life.""  The film speaks of Ulbricht's libertarian leanings and suggests Silk Road was much more about affording people the freedom to buy and sell whatever they wish (so long as it didn't cause harm to others) than about drug dealers making a quick buck.  ""The people I got to know in this world didn't make a lot of money. These weren’t people who were driven by money, they were driven by ideals,"" Winter said.  These people aimed to exercise their freedom and create a safer alternative to the existing drugs market, which is plagued by death and violence.  In Deep Web, Neill Franklin, the director of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition describes how he experienced this first-hand when working as a Maryland State Police major.  During the early 2000s, he came to the realisation that policies on drug prohibition were ""counterproductive to public safety"" and gradually became opposed to the War on Drugs.  He believes moving the drugs trade from street corners to online services would lead to a dramatic decrease in the number of shootings and homicides.  ""It removes the buyer from the back alleys and the street corners and those dangerous places [where people are] dealing with the seller. Buying over the Internet … removes that scenario.""  He emphasised that, after four decades of the War on Drugs, it's clear it isn't working, so it's time to try a new approach.  Law enforcement tactics  The actions of US law enforcement are also called into question elsewhere in the film. Wired tech journalist Andy Greenberg and Berkley computer scientist Nicholas Weaver discuss the mystery surrounding the seizure of the Silk Road servers, which were at a data centre in Iceland.  The physical location of these servers was protected by Tor, which defends against traffic analysis and network surveillance, so the mystery as to how this was obtained remains unsolved.  Although the FBI asserts it did not use illegal techniques to obtain the server, many suggest illegal hacking methods were used.  ""We still don't know how the Silk Road server was found, we don't know whether Ross' fourth amendment rights were violated and whether this case will set precedence for the violation of any citizen's rights in the digital age,"" said Winter.  As for whether the authorities are scapegoating Ulbricht for his involvement in Silk Road, Winters isn't sure. The 49-year-old said it's clear Ulbricht is not entirely innocent – he admitted to founding the site – but there are some things he is likely being unfairly lumbered with.  Winter believes the authorities will choose to make an example of Ulbricht and hand out a harsh sentence, but he doesn't feel this will hamper the creation or progression of online drugs marketplaces.  ""There are more and more market places popping up every day – it's certainly the beginning of this era, not the end.""  The true significance of bitcoin  Bitcoin plays a big part in this film, as the payment method used to buy goods on Silk Road, and Winter is a long-time fan of digital currency.  He first become aware of bitcoin in 2009 while working on his previous film Downloaded, about the controversial file-sharing site Napster, which rocked the music industry in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  It wasn't until 2011 or 2012 that he realised the ""true significance"" of bitcoin, and that was when he came across Silk Road.  ""Silk Road combined bitcoin and Tor in a way that was so powerful that it created a movement and the mechanics for a new marketplace – a new way of using bitcoin. It popularised bitcoin in such a way that there’s really no going back,"" he said.  [post-quote]  According to Winter, the true power of bitcoin lies in its supporting community.  ""I think bitcoin is very threatening to various established systems because of the community component,"" he explained.  He's also adamant that bitcoin's use on illegal marketplaces such as Silk Road will not do, and has not done, the cryptocurrency any harm. The director believes bitcoin wouldn't be where it is today if it wasn't for Silk Road.  ""Silk Road put bitcoin on the map, just like Napster put peer-to-peer communities on the map.""  Also a fan of bitcoin is the movie's narrator, Keanu Reeves, of Matrix and Point Break fame and Winter's co-star in Bill and Ted.  ""Keanu has been watching my cuts since the early days of this project, he's very very interested in this story, so that's why he got involved. He's also into bitcoin,"" said Winter.  Black, whites and greys  When asked about the film's main message, Winter insists there isn’t just the one. The issues raised in the film are so complex and intertwined it's impossible to walk away with one resounding message in mind.  ""I don't want people to get trapped in the black and white,"" he said.  ""The human brain has this impulse to side on one side or the other, but I think it's a big mistake not to live in the greys. You need to get out of the black and whites.""  Deep Web premieres on 31st May at 20:00 ET on EPIX.

42378185,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ML4t,1429191044,SecondMarket's Bitcoin Desk Relaunches as Genesis Trading,"The former bitcoin trading division at SecondMarket has relaunched as the Digital Currency Group's (DCG) latest subsidiary, Genesis Trading.  Advertising itself as the first regulated broker-dealer in the US to specialize in bitcoin, Genesis is the latest development at Barry Silbert's increasingly active organisation.  The trading firm offers institutional and private investors a way to buy and sell large blocks of digital currencies such as bitcoin, litecoin and ripple, a specialty its team honed sourcing bitcoins for SecondMarket's private investment vehicle, Bitcoin Investment Trust.  Genesis CEO Brendan O'Connor suggested that the launch represents more of a rebranding than a formal market debut, given Genesis Trading's established history in the space.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We have been trading since 2013. Within our space, the numbers that we have done make us the largest over-the-counter (OTC) market maker out there, so this is our opportunity to market ourselves to the world. Prior to this point, we haven't really been able to do that.""  The 10-person team will continue to operate as the authorized participant for the Bitcoin Investment Trust, the sponsor that obtains the underlying assets needed for the fund.  O'Connor went on to express his belief that the firm is the first broker-dealer in the US regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to actively trade bitcoin. Genesis Trading, he added, is already working with clients including hedge funds and alternative asset fund managers.  The news follows the 26th March debut of Grayscale Investments, which currently sponsors the Bitcoin Investment Trust as a subsidiary of DCG.  Silbert, SecondMarket's long-time CEO, resigned from his position in July, announcing the bitcoin-focused initiative DCG in October.  Competitive pricing  Prospective customers of Genesis Trading will need to follow strict anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, O'Connor said. Despite this, he believes the firm's buying process is competitive with major exchanges and brokerages.  ""We have the ability to buy for our own book,"" O'Connor said. ""If people are interested in buying block size, we're defining that as 25 BTC or more. People can contact us, we ask them to fill out a new applicant profile form and they will go through a vetting process.""  O'Connor aims to parlay his team's market knowledge into relationships with clients he believes are too busy to use traditional exchanges, and thus, require a strong connection with their broker-dealer.  ""Guys that are in those positions are typically very busy and relationships and trust really mean something to these people,"" he continued.  Long-term bulls  O'Connor indicated that Genesis did not have a comment as to whether the launch would be in any way affected by the current price of bitcoin, which has traded below $250 for much of the week.  Its own strategy, he said, hasn't changed in light of any recent fluctuations.  ""We think the currency and technology is the most interesting thing in the payment space in the last 50 years, and our thesis has not changed,"" O'Connor stated.  At the time of the interview, however, O'Connor kept his focus on the present, concluding:  ""It's a very proud moment for us. So we're thrilled that Barry [Silbert] has given us the opportunity.""

42378148,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MKxL,1429185622,Former Yahoo Exec Appointed COO of Ripple Labs,"Ripple Labs has appointed former Yahoo and AOL executive Brad Garlinghouse as its new COO.  Garlinghouse, who sits on the board of Ancestry.com, became the CEO of file-sharing firm Hightail in 2012. He departed last fall following a dispute over a potential sale of the company, as reported at the time by Re/code.  In a press statement about his new role, Garlinghouse said:  ""There is already incredible momentum for Ripple as a new infrastructure for global payments, and the opportunity to define the actual framework for the Internet of Value is an order of magnitude bigger than anything else underway in payments today.""  The move comes weeks after Ripple Labs tapped former US State Department official Anja Manuel to work as an advisor. Former National Economic Council director Gene Sperling joined the company’s board of directors in January.  Garlinghouse made headlines in 2006 after an internal Yahoo memo he penned was leaked and subsequently published. In the document, termed the 'peanut butter manifesto', he criticized the company’s lack of focus and called for a number of changes, including staff cuts.      Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Brad Garlinghouse was Ripple's CEO. He is COO, Chris Larsen remains the company's CEO.",POSITIVE,없음,OTHER,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/04/16/former-yahoo-exec-appointed-coo-of-ripple-labs,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
