Users of 99Pay will be able to execute commission-free transactions with a minimum purchase amount of 10 Brazilian reais and a maximum of 10,000 reais – equivalent to $1,800 – starting Nov. 3.  99Pay, part of the Chinese vehicle-for-hire company DiDi Chuxing, said that the platform will deliver bitcoin cashback promotions, as well.  The initiative comes amid rapidly increasing interest in cryptocurrency among Brazilians. According to data published by the country’s Central Bank (BCB) in October, Brazilians have acquired $4.27 billion in cryptocurrencies so far in 2021. On the legislative front, Brazil’s congress plans to discuss a bill that would regulate crypto companies.  Brazil’s 99 is a ride-hailing, food delivery and financial services company founded in 2012. It was acquired by DiDi, the Chinese equivalent of Uber, for $1 billion in 2018. The 99Pay platform has 20 million active users, according to the company.  99 launched its digital wallet in July 2020 within its app and introduced a 99Pay stand-alone app last week.  Users won’t be able to use bitcoin to pay for trips on 99, because the cryptocurrency will first have to be switched to fiat, 99Pay executive director Maurício Orsolini Filho told CoinDesk.  Orsolini Filho added that the company implemented the bitcoin trading feature following research conducted at the company’s request that showed strong demand for the service. According to the data, 81% of Brazilian digital banks’ users already know or have heard of cryptocurrencies, and 54% don’t invest in digital assets but have shown interest in entering the market.

Robinhood said its crypto revenues fell to just $51 million in the third quarter, down from a record $233 million in the second quarter. The company said the reduced crypto trading activity led to significantly fewer new funded accounts and lower revenue in the quarter as compared to the second quarter.  Total revenue for the quarter was $365 million, short of analyst estimates of $437.1 million, according to FactSet. The company reported an adjusted net loss of $2.06 per share, versus analyst expectations of a loss of $0.67.  Robinhood said that over one million customers have signed up on the waiting list for its crypto wallet, which is one of its “most heavily requested products.”  The company also launched recurring crypto investments, allowing customers to automatically buy crypto, without paying commissions and on their own schedule.  On the company’s earnings call on Tuesday, CEO Vlad Tenev said the company was awaiting regulatory clarity before adding more cryptocurrencies to the seven that customers can currently trade – bitcoin, bitcoin cash, bitcoin SV, dogecoin, ethereum, ethereum classic and litecoin. “We’re going to be very careful,” Tenev said.  Previous speculation existed around Shiba Inu being added to Robinhood’s crypto offerings, though Tenev made no mention of this on the call.  The company also noted that the popularity of dogecoin contributed to millions of new accounts being added in the second quarter.

The cryptocurrency was trading at around $62,000 at press time and is roughly flat over the past 24 hours.  The bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is starting to decline from its highest level in more than seven months, which suggests buyers are starting to take some profits after a nearly 45% rise in BTC’s price over the past month.  In the bitcoin futures market, leveraged funds on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) raised their bets against bitcoin rising to a record high in the week ended Oct. 19, possibly to profit from the widening gap between futures and spot markets prices, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported.  For now, technical indicators suggest limited pullbacks after a retest near the $60,000 support level in bitcoin’s price was achieved earlier this week.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $62,020.52, -1.29%  Ether (ETH): $4,224.98, +0.65%  S&P 500: $4,574.79, +0.18%  Gold: $1,793.80, -0.79%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.62%  Slight profit taking  Blockchain data show long-term bitcoin holders are starting to take some profits, which typically occurs when BTC reaches an all-time high.  Based on the current price cycle, profit-taking from long-term holders appears to be modest relative to extreme levels seen at the end of a bull market phase, according to a blog post from Glassnode.  The chart below shows significant accumulation of bitcoin around mid-September during a pullback in BTC’s price. And despite the slight profit-taking, current positioning by long-term holders is consistent with the early phase of a bull market, according to Glassnode.  Bitcoin balance on exchanges declines  The total balance of bitcoin on exchanges continues to decline, which suggests traders are holding coins in wallets instead of making them available to trade on an exchange.  “Relative to the circulating supply, the bitcoin balance at exchanges sits at levels not seen since January 2018,” Arcane Research wrote in a Tuesday newsletter. “This could suggest that the demand to sell is low at the moment.”  Taproot priced in?  The last time the Bitcoin network locked in a major upgrade, in July 2017, the cryptocurrency’s price jumped almost 50% through Aug. 23 of that year, when the changes went live.  Now, as the original blockchain network prepares for its next big upgrade in November, an upgrade that is known as Taproot, few investors are expecting a price reaction anywhere near that scale.  BTC’s price has already doubled this year and hit a new all-time high near $67,000 last week. While further gains are possible, Taproot alone likely won’t be the catalyst, CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma wrote.  Read more here.

The operation dubbed “Operation Dark HunTor” cracked down on criminals who were involved in the sale of tens of thousands of illicit goods and services across Australia, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the U.K. and the U.S.  The U.S.-Italian operations seized €3.6 million (US$4.17 million) in cryptocurrencies, while police seized approximately $1 million in drug proceeds that included $700,000 in cryptocurrency.  Overall, Operation Dark HunTor resulted in the seizure of over $31.6 million in both cash and virtual currencies, approximately 234 kilograms of drugs worldwide and 45 firearms.  The U.S. Department of Justice reports darknet vendor accounts were linked to individuals selling illicit goods on active marketplaces, as well as inactive darknet marketplaces such as Dream, WallStreet, White House, DeepSea and Dark Market.  “Criminal darknet markets exist so drug dealers can profit at the expense of others’ safety. The FBI is committed to working with our JCODE and Europol law enforcement partners to disrupt those markets and the borderless, worldwide trade in illicit drugs they enable,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray in a statement.

42413891,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAlsMw,1635285451,Direxion Files for Short Bitcoin Futures ETF,"Exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer Direxion wants to short the price of a bitcoin futures contract.  According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday, the Direxion Bitcoin Strategy Bear ETF will maintain short exposure to bitcoin futures contracts issued by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The product won’t directly invest in bitcoin.  Shorting is a bet that the price of something – in this case, bitcoin futures contracts – will go down over a certain period of time.  The ETF might also invest in other bitcoin futures ETFs or money market funds, deposit accounts or short-term debt instruments.  “The fund will generally maintain its short exposure to bitcoin futures during periods in which the value of bitcoin is flat or declining as well as during periods in which the value of bitcoin is rising,” the filing said.  This is Direxion’s first bitcoin ETF filing in three years, after the SEC rejected past efforts.  Direxion isn’t the only issuer hoping to put a creative spin on bitcoin futures ETFs.

42396701,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4mqI,1635285440,CME Leveraged Funds Raise Bets Against Bitcoin to Record High as Futures Premium Spikes,"Leveraged funds on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) raised their bets against bitcoin rising to a record high in the week ended Oct. 19, possibly to profit from the widening gap between futures and spot markets prices.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) Commitments of Traders report released on Friday showed leveraged funds held a net short position of 31,000 contracts in the seven days to Oct. 19, marking an increase of 6,000 from the previous week.  Record shorts by leverage funds does not necessarily mean these traders had a bearish bias. They may have raised short positions in the futures market and simultaneously bought the cryptocurrency in the spot market, booking the so-called carry trade.  The strategy is initiated when futures trade at a notable premium to the spot price and trades can profit from an eventual convergence of prices in the two markets.  The annualized premium in the front-month bitcoin futures contracts surged from 1% to 20% in the run-up to ProShares’ Bitcoin Strategy ETF launch on Oct. 18, and was last seen at 13%. The three-month rolling premium also rose from 3% to 16% before tapering to 11.7%.  ProShares’ ETF, which invests in the CME-listed bitcoin futures contracts, made a strong debut last Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, while Valkyrie’s futures-based ETF went live on Friday.  Earlier this month, analysts had warned of an uptick in futures premium and renewed interest in cash and carry arbitrage.

42394383,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvckMd,1635280200,Everyone Wants Crypto Regulations – On Their Terms,"Major players in the crypto industry want favorable regulations, and they’re actively explaining their own visions.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Policy week  The narrative  There’s a growing push from the crypto industry to suggest how regulators can approach this rapidly-growing sector.  Why it matters  Crypto exchanges Coinbase and FTX, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and the Digital Dollar Foundation have all recently published suggested policy proposals for addressing the digital asset market, ranging from creating a dedicated regulator for crypto to detailing how a central bank digital currency could address privacy issues.  Clearly, the industry is hoping to have a hand in creating a favorable regulatory regime in the U.S.  Breaking it down  So, these proposals could be seen in two different ways. The first is as a serious policy push that industry players hope will one day come to fruition. The other is an effort to kick-start a conversation around how crypto should be regulated.  I was in Washington, D.C., last week meeting folks both from industry and from the offices of various lawmakers and it’s really not yet clear to me what sort of traction these industry-driven proposals will gain. Ignoring for a minute the difficulties in passing a bill through both the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, the proposals themselves would require buy-in from a broad swath of both regulators and the lawmakers overseeing them.  Much of the reception to these proposals has been that they may all be nonstarters. Lawmakers aren’t interested in letting the crypto industry define the terms of its regulatory framework for various reasons, according to some of the individuals I spoke to. On a substantive level, even crypto-friendly lawmakers seem to disagree with the premise of pouring excessive resources into developing novel tools for overseeing crypto.  Tweets and public statements lambasting regulators are also not impressing the lawmakers who might look at these proposals. They might even be counterproductive if the goal is to be taken seriously, say Washington insiders.  (Seriously, it’s kind of amazing how many different people brought up recent tweets as examples of how to not make a case for favorable crypto regulation.)  If these proposals aren’t meant to be taken literally, but rather as a spark for conversation, then they may actually be going somewhere. While the proposals themselves are varied in scope, they share some common themes: being precise in defining terms, calling for greater transparency and user privacy concerns.  We know that the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets plans to publish its stablecoin report soon, which will call for Congress to enact legislation treating stablecoin issuers like banks. One of a16z’s proposals recommended something similar, which may be helpful for lawmakers who are looking for industry input if they try to craft this kind of bill.  Clearer definitions of tokens may also help, for the crowd that sees a distinction between utility tokens and security tokens. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has so far maintained there’s no real difference in the U.S., but safe harbor proposals from Commissioner Hester Peirce and Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) would create these distinctions if enacted, from which startups and other industry advocates would benefit.  It’s clear regulations are coming. It’s also likely pushback will be involved along the way. One project may know that better than most.  Novi’s first steps  Novi, Facebook’s digital wallet subsidiary, announced a small pilot project last week in partnership with stablecoin issuer Paxos and crypto exchange Coinbase’s custody wing. Under the terms of the pilot project, which will launch in the U.S. and Guatemala, Novi customers can purchase Paxos dollars (USDP) and the company will store the funds with Coinbase Custody.  Just hours later, five U.S. Democratic senators published an open letter ordering Facebook to cease and desist, adding on an order to discontinue work on its own Diem project for good measure.  Even though only Democrats signed the letter, I’m told that a dislike of Facebook is one of the few truly bipartisan issues in Washington right now.  The bad news for Diem, and by extension projects like Novi, is that it’s also maybe inextricably linked to Facebook due to how the social media giant announced the project in 2019.  Novi, of course, is also a direct subsidiary to Facebook, which likely didn’t help it on the reputational front last week.  A lot of the current conversation around stablecoin regulation can trace its origins back to the original Libra project announcement. While the industry has changed since then, the perception of Facebook hasn’t. Recent reports about Facebook won’t help.  The thing to watch for now is whether Facebook will continue with its pilot project or proceed to a full launch of the Novi wallet or whether it will suspend these operations in light of congressional opposition.  Diem, which is a separate entity, faces a similar question. A few months ago it announced it was partnering with Silvergate Bank to launch a dollar-pegged stablecoin pending regulatory approvals. These approvals are still pending and there isn’t a clear timeline right now for when this may launch.

The Graph is used by developers to access data such as prices and user information. The protocol is live on 25 blockchain networks.  Tegan Kline, a co-founder of The Graph developer Edge & Node, told CoinDesk in an interview that it took “many months” to complete the integration, as The Graph has previously expanded only to blockchains that are compatible with the Ethereum blockchain.  The protocol managed to make the migration because of a grant from The Graph Foundation to blockchain data company StreamingFast, which became a core contributor to The Graph earlier in the year. The foundation distributes grants to projects that are building on The Graph.  Kline also said that developers can expect to find The Graph on other blockchains that aren’t compatible with Ethereum in the coming months, as The Graph Foundation will continue to offer grants to help the service expand.  “Wherever developers go, The Graph will be,” she added.

42410953,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtjsp,1635279054,Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade Might Already Be Priced In,"The last time the Bitcoin network locked in a major upgrade, in July 2017, the bitcoin cryptocurrency’s price jumped almost 50% through Aug. 23, when the changes went live.  Now, as the original blockchain network prepares for its next big upgrade in November, known as Taproot, few investors are expecting a price reaction anywhere near that scale. BTC’s price has already doubled this year, and it hit a new all-time high near $69,000 in early November. While further gains are possible, Taproot alone likely won’t be the catalyst.  “The Taproot upgrade will have minimal impact on bitcoin’s price,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the online foreign-exchange broker Oanda.  Set to go into effect on Nov. 14, the Taproot upgrade is designed to increase privacy protections on some transactions over the network through an innovation known as “Schnorr signatures.” The upgrade also will allow for more lightweight “smart contracts” – essentially programs stored on a blockchain that run when certain conditions are met. Smart contracts have been a key feature of the rival Ethereum network, powering fast growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications that aim to automate many functions of banks and trading firms.  “This is a revolutionary moment for Bitcoin,” said Don Guo, CEO of Broctagon Fintech Group.  Yet, the episode is serving to highlight a key difference in Bitcoin’s approach to network improvements versus competing blockchains where upgrades and tweaks are far more common. Ethereum, the No. 2 blockchain, just off the heels of its London hard fork in August and now pushing forward with its “Ethereum 2.0″ overhaul expected next year, has seen the price of ether, its native cryptocurrency, quintuple this year.  Is Taproot good for bitcoin?  Backers of Bitcoin say the slow-going approach simply shows how methodical and cautious its developers are – wary of doing anything that might hurt a revolutionary blockchain network that has defied most expectations since its introduction 12 years ago.  But some investors have grown more skeptical of the Bitcoin network’s ability to adapt and expand, worried that its first-mover advantage might be eroding. Given the rapid pace of development in the blockchain industry, four years without a major upgrade can seem like eons.  Read more: An Investor’s Perspective on the Bitcoin Taproot Upgrade  “Some may argue that Bitcoin’s lack of upgrades shows its technical superiority over Ethereum,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital.  He said the Taproot implementation is likely to have a limited impact on the cryptocurrency’s price because the upgrade has been widely expected for years.  “The risk is the market will see it as being something that is already available elsewhere,” said Vinokourov.  Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, and a protocol researcher, told CoinDesk in an interview that despite the infrequency of upgrades, hordes of developers are constantly working on network improvements in the background. Developers have been preparing for the Taproot upgrade since 2018, the year after the Segregated Witness, or “SegWit,” upgrade went through.  “This is a false story that people make, that Bitcoin is not developing very fast,” Back said. “People mistake the lengthy rigorous quality assurance as a lack of change. There is a pipeline of change and it’s large, but it has a slow release schedule because it needs testing.”  According to Back, “People get impatient because it has been a year since they heard about it in the press.”  “Competing coins do a lot of futuristic marketing about what might happen in five years,” he said.  Only four years ago …  If history were a guide, the upgrade could usher in big gains.  The 2017 upgrade that introduced SegWit improved Bitcoin’s scalability by “segregating” specific data from individual transactions, effectively making them smaller. This step allowed more transactions to be processed without increasing the size of individual data blocks.  Another key feature of the 2017 upgrade was the enabling of the Lightning Network, a secondary layer built on top of the Bitcoin base layer, which facilitates near-instantaneous, free and more private bitcoin transactions. The development of the Lightning Network since 2017 is what allowed it to become a linchpin of El Salvador’s push to make bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar.  SegWit was approved on July 23. A month later, when the upgrade went live, the price of bitcoin had climbed 50%, to a then-astounding $4,247 on Aug. 23, 2017.  Above: The turquoise vertical bar on bitcoin’s price chart highlights the price impact of the SegWit upgrade in 2017. It was a big jump at the time, though the cryptocurrency’s subsequent rally makes it look like a blip.  But with bitcoin now trading above $60,000, some investors think the cryptocurrency’s price rise might look – well, tapped out.  “There might be a limit to how much more upside you can really get from bitcoin,” Daniel Cawrey, COO at Cypherpunk Holdings Inc., a digital-asset investment firm. (Cawrey is a former CoinDesk reporter.)  “If you’re an institutional investor, it already looks like you’ve missed the boat,” said Cawrey. This is why investors are looking to Ethereum and a host of competing blockchains known as “Eth killers,” according to Cawrey.  What will Taproot enable?  Anton Chashchin, Managing Partner of Bitfrost.io, a blockchain middleware platform, said that the introduction of smart contracts could actually add to interest from institutional investors, given the potential for creating new products and applications.  The new privacy enhancements, on the other hand, might invite closer scrutiny from governments concerned about preventing tax evasion, money laundering and any illicit activities.  “While these can be attractive to private transactions, this may also arouse the suspicion of regulators,” Chashchin said. “There’s a lot of talk of regulations already, and this might be the last straw that makes regulators step in more aggressively.”  Cryptocurrency investors fretted over China’s crackdown on bitcoin miners in September. Concerns over the network’s energy usage and potential environmental harms remain paramount for many traditional investors.  It might be hard for investors to get much more bullish on bitcoin than they already are, with the price now having fully recovered all lost ground from the June low around $28,600. The long-awaited rollout of new U.S. exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on bitcoin futures started last week, with the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF’s assets topping $1 billion in just two days. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF launched Friday. VanEck’s ETF is set to launch Tuesday.  But according to blockchain analysis firm IntoTheBlock, the Taproot upgrade might demonstrate that Bitcoin is a technology that can be adapted and upgraded without any impact on its reliability or uptime, while maintaining its investing thesis as a store of value.  “We expect that investors will receive these upgrades positively, and the price will continue increasing in the long term,” said Juan Pellicer, research analyst at IntoTheBlock.  Said Broctagon’s Guo: “With a successful technical implementation followed by increasing adoption, there is no reason why the price should not follow.”  UPDATE (Nov. 11, 2021, at 20:50 UTC): This article was changed to reflect current market conditions and to adjust the date of activation to Nov. 14.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/26/taproot-bitcoins-next-big-upgrade-might-already-be-priced-in,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6c806de34bf49a0ed66ccdaf12214c4f84eccdc0-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to Helium, the deal announced Tuesday marks the first collaboration between Helium, a decentralized internet network with over 250,000 hotspots, and a major carrier. Seemingly related to the move, DISH is looking to hire a “Digital Currency and Blockchain Product Lead,” according to a Tuesday job post.  “DISH Wireless is building a next-gen 5G network to disrupt the wireless industry and fuel innovation in transportation, health care, education, sustainability, city management and agriculture,” the post said.  Helium’s network connects devices to the internet using LoRaWAN. Because the network is strengthened by the addition of new hotspots, network operators are rewarded in Helium’s native HNT, a token mined by the hotspots themselves.  Helium says it has 3.5 million additional hotspots back-ordered and over 50 new manufacturers waiting to be approved to build and sell Helium Network-compatible hardware, according to a press release.  The company sees the back orders as a “rolling 12-month forecast” of the company’s growth, Helium Chief Operating Officer Frank Mong told CoinDesk in an interview.  The hotspots are operated in partnership with FreedomFi, a 5G company that specializes in private networks.

42394384,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvckHV,1635272920,How to Dismantle the Surveillance State After the Patriot Act,"Today marks 20 years of the so-called “Patriot Act,” a law passed to “deter and punish” suspected terrorists in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Many provisions of the law were unconstitutional, many were ineffective. In fact, in 2015 a subsequent law replaced the act. Taken as a whole, however, the effect of the Patriot Act was to cheat U.S. citizens out of their civil rights and cheapen American democracy.  It’s time to dismantle the surveillance state engendered by the Patriot Act. It’s also time to invest in and build alternative technologies that would make the law (partially) irrelevant. Issued in the name of collective security, the law eroded some of the most basic protections you might expect in a liberal democracy.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “Twenty years of hindsight confirm that expanded government surveillance comes at a steep price for civil rights, our democratic legitimacy and marginalized populations,” American Constitution Society President Russ Feingold wrote in a recently syndicated op-ed. “Congress has a unique opportunity to begin the deconstruction of the surveillance state. It should seize it.”  There is a balance between national security, which requires investing authorities with the ability to detect potential threats and punish wrongdoers, and protecting individual freedoms. We’ve gotten this dance all wrong. The legacy of the Patriot Act is widespread wiretaps, unchecked warrants and a nosy state interested in reading your financial, medical and travel records.  A government that can glance at your email inbox, monitor whom you call and infer your bedside book stack knows far too much about what you’re thinking. Creepy, sure, but also illegal.  As the EFF notes in a fact sheet, the Patriot Act, officially known as the “Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001″ violates constitutional gaurantees in four keys ways:  “Violates the Fourth Amendment, which says the government cannot conduct a search without obtaining a warrant and showing probable cause to believe that the person has committed or will commit a crime.  “Violates the First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech by prohibiting the recipients of search orders from telling others about those orders, even where there is no real need for secrecy.  “Violates the First Amendment by effectively authorizing the FBI to launch investigations of American citizens in part for exercising their freedom of speech.  “Violates the Fourth Amendmentby failing to provide notice - even after the fact - to persons whose privacy has been compromised. Notice is also a key element of due process, which is guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.”  The majority of American people are not “domestic terrorists,” yet we’re all (potentially) treated as such. The Patriot Act was grafted onto the preexisting Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (better known as FISA), which was passed in 1978 to help the government gather foreign intelligence and investigate international terrorism. It applied only to an “agent of a foreign power” and information gathering was limited to “common carriers,” or hotel stays, storage lockers and car rental services, the EFF notes.  Nowadays, just about anyone or anything could find its way onto a watchlist under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), for instance, can obtain a secret court order to monitor any “tangible” assets said to be relevant to a national security inquiry. (This mandate lapsed earlier this year, and was checked partially by the U.S. Supreme Court, but can still be applied to ongoing cases.)  According to Jake Laperruque, a lawyer for the nonpartisan government watchdog Project On Government Oversight (POGO), Section 215 was used to collect records from over 19 million phone calls in 2018 alone. In response to evidence of overcollection, the National Security Agency (NSA) shut down its program.  This might be understandable if it actually provided security, but time and again, the NSA has failed to provide evidence any of this information gathering over nearly two decades has contributed to preempting a terrorist plot. (Though there’s plenty of evidence suggesting would-be terrorists were coaxed into their worst plans.)  What about the anti-terrorist financing or money laundering provisions of Section 314? The Financial Times asked and answered: “Two decades on, it is virtually impossible to define the percentage of funds illicitly moving in and out of the global banking system, away from the prying eyes of global rulemakers.”  Feingold, a former U.S. senator representing Wisconsin between 1993-2011, cast the only vote against the Patriot Act. It was a courageous stand in 2001. He now advocates for strengthening the judiciary’s role in counterterrorism efforts and limiting the broad powers invested in the surveillance apparatus to monitor U.S. civilians. But to some extent he doesn’t go far enough.  The courts will be key to restraining “the surveillance state.” But the world is also a much different place than two decades ago. Even while citizens and media personalities push back against government snooping – everyday Americans (largely) accept some form of corporate surveillance.  Government surveillance is now intertwined with Big Tech. Amazon, Palantir and Chainalysis are just a few examples of private companies that sign big-ticket contracts with government agencies to fork over individual’s information.  See also: How FinCEN Became a Honeypot for Sensitive Personal Data  Tiffany C. Li, a visiting professor at Boston University School of Law and a fellow at Yale Law School’s Information Society Project, advocated in an MSNBC column for a federal privacy law, bans on corporations working with exporting data and new norms around sharing.  I’d add to that list: Individuals and organizations should be investing in the tools that guarantee privacy at a foundational level. People should trial new technologies and take greater responsibility for their personal information.  There’s no reason to trust surveillance agencies or mega companies to do the right thing. And legislative and judiciary efforts to limit the control of the public and private “surveillance apparatus” have largely been hamstrung.

42394396,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvclBv,1635267631,What Drives Crypto Users? Distrust of the System or Speculation?,"The rise of bitcoin, ether, Cardano’s ADA and related cryptocurrencies – with market capitalizations returning to all-time highs and at times rivaling that of metals like silver and the world’s major financial companies – warrants an examination of investor views, characteristics and sophistication.  One motivation for creating these digital assets was finding a substitute to fiat money and commercial banking with a new form of exchange that is resistant to debasement and censorship by governments, international organizations and financial institutions. Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, highlighted that we needed an electronic payment system that allowed us to make transactions without a third party. Also, one of the founders of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, considered “non-discrimination and non-censorship” one of the key principles behind Ethereum’s design.  Are cryptocurrencies sought out of distrust in fiat currencies or regulated finance? And who invests in cryptocurrencies?  Looking at this issue in a BIS working paper, we use data from the “Survey of Consumer Payment Choice” (SCPC), a dataset that is representative for the U.S. population and spans the period from 2014 to 2019. Our working paper shows there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that cryptocurrencies are sought as an alternative to fiat currencies or regulated finance in the U.S. Compared with the general population (see the first two columns of the chart below), cryptocurrency investors do not have heightened concerns about the security of mainstream payment options such as cash or commercial banking services.  We find that cryptocurrencies remain niche markets dominated by young, male, educated investors. In fact, one of the main socioeconomic determinants of U.S. cryptocurrency investors is educational attainment. Being young is also associated with a higher likelihood of owning at least one cryptocurrency.  What drives crypto  In our BIS working paper, we have analyzed data up to 2019. Have the patterns changed during the COVID-19 pandemic? It may be that recent crypto hype might have changed the composition of investors.  Figure 2 uses data from the “Survey of Consumer Payment Choice” for the year 2020 that has recently become available. The 2020 survey was conducted during October. There was a higher demand for cryptocurrencies during the pandemic. In fact, the pool of investors was much wider in 2020 than in 2019. According to the data, almost 4% of U.S. citizens own at least one cryptocurrency in comparison with the 1.9% of the previous year. Cryptocurrency adoption is becoming more widespread. There is also an upward trend in the number of people who know about cryptocurrencies (more than 72% in 2020).  Second, the right-hand side of the chart below shows that while there is still no distrust, investors are becoming more like the average population. Again, there are not a lot of differences with respect to the concerns of the security of cash (see left-hand columns). However, cryptocurrencies have been adopted by less educated people than in 2019.  The average age of cryptocurrency investors has also increased. This means cryptocurrencies continue to be owned by young, male and well-educated investors, but the differences with the general population have become smaller over time. As hype around the cryptocurrency sector has increased, more “standard” investors became interested in and attracted to this asset class.  Conclusion  It is crucial to comprehend whether the continued rise of cryptocurrencies could indicate growing distrust in today’s regulated financial markets and monetary arrangements. We find that this is not the case.  From a policy perspective, if the objectives of investors are the same as those for other asset classes, so should be the regulation. Cryptocurrencies are not sought as an alternative to fiat currencies or regulated finance, but instead are a digital speculation asset. More recent data also shows that crypto investors are becoming more like the general population, i.e., cryptocurrencies are going mainstream.  We argue that a clarifying regulatory and supervisory framework for cryptocurrency markets may be beneficial for the industry in a context where cryptocurrencies are being targeted by less-educated investors and adoption is becoming widespread.  Nevertheless, one important consideration concerns how one could apply technology-neutral regulation, while at the same time harnessing the potential of the technology itself in the supervision process. One option for such a framework is “embedded supervision.” This means implementing a supervisory framework for cryptocurrencies that allows for compliance to be automatically monitored by reading the market’s ledger.  The benefits of this framework are numerous. For instance, it may allow the regulator to ensure that all fund exchanges are backed by on-chain cryptocurrency holdings.

However, that looks poised to change. The approvals of three bitcoin ETFs in the past week have brought about more institutional interest in the digital asset and Wall Street brokers are starting to turn their attention to the cryptocurrency. The first Bitcoin ETF recorded trading volumes of over $1 billion on its first day. This success has not missed the radar of Wall Street. Analyst Christopher Brendler sat down with Coindesk to talk about the future of bitcoin in Wall Street. According to Brendler, Wall Street brokers are getting increasingly positive about BTC investments. It is important to note that bitcoin has outperformed both the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P year-over-year, as seen in a report from Wealthier Today. Interested In Bitcoin And Mining Brendler had previously collated data on how the bitcoin mining industry was being viewed by players in Wall Street. He found that brokers had a positive view of the industry in the short term. Brendler estimated that about 15% of Wall Street brokers from the payments side of things were beginning to take investments in the cryptocurrency more seriously. This number at been at a meager 5% of Wall Street brokers at the beginning of the year.

Multicoin Capital led the token sale with crypto trading firms Jump Capital and Alameda Research joining the round, among others. Their participation highlights market makers’ appetite for exposure to Solana’s still-nascent decentralized exchange (DEX) scene.  Drift focuses on perpetual swaps, or futures contracts without an expiry. Across all of crypto, that market saw $170 billion in trading volume over the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko, with the lion’s share riding atop the Ethereum blockchain.  Solana’s $7 billion swaps landscape is much less developed as only a handful of exchanges are participating, and even fewer DEXs. Mango Markets, dYdX and now Drift are competing for traders’ dollars.  Solana DEXs  Cindy Leow, a co-founder of Drift, said her DEX uses a “dynamic automated market maker” to keep the needs of Drift’s liquidity pool in line with market demands. She claimed Drift is more capital-efficient than the automated market makers (AMMs) prevalent on many chains.  In practice, that means the market mechanisms that worked when bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $10,000 may no longer be suitable.  “Who’s going to pay 3% for a 1 BTC trade? That’s ridiculous,” she said. “We have a mechanism that essentially repegs the core of the virtual AMM – where you have the most liquidity, the lowest slippage – back to the current oracle price.”  Drift is set to launch this month with support for SOL, BTC, ETH and Solana ecosystem tokens.",POSITIVE,BTC | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | SOL | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/26/solana-based-perpetual-swaps-dex-raises-38m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e48a07b58b00e346ead427f9da59ddd81721f8e-1600x1067.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

KYVE – a stylized take on the second syllable of “archive” – has closed its second funding round led by Permanent Ventures and Hypersphere Ventures, and with contributions from Zee Prime and CMS Holdings. Arweave, Avalanche Foundation, Interchain Foundation, NEAR Foundation, Solana Foundation are among the others involved.  KYVE, which is currently in testnet, uses Arweave to store blockchain data whose veracity is verified by a network of node operators.  “The bigger picture is that KYVE is a tool for creating a fully decentralized data network, where everyone can access the data, get it in and query the data, and it’s all trustless,” said KYVE co-founder Fabian Riewe in an interview with CoinDesk.  While data storage and access might not seem exciting at first blush, Riewe described a use case where new Solana nodes could query KYVE from a “valid point,” allowing for more lightweight nodes that don’t need to have the blockchain’s full history. Running a Solana node carries a notably high hardware load, and this could lower memory requirements.

This use case is already being tested out on Avalanche, per Riewe.  “We actually saw this happening on the Avalanche side,” said Riewe. “We have a lot of Avalanche data, and what the nodes do is they prune their local database and just say, ‘Well, if I ever have to serve this data, I’ll just request through KYVE and serve it through there.’”  Data ‘pipeline’  Other use cases include price oracles, cross-chain data, cross-chain bridges, storing (and changing, depending on monitored external events) non-fungible token (NFT) metadata and “translating” data between Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and non-EVM chains, allowing cross-blockchain events to trigger.  When trying to describe the business model, Riewe compared KYVE to an oil pipeline – but instead of crude oil, Kyve transports data.  “KYVE is a pipeline, transporting the oil from one place to someplace else, and people do crazy stuff with the oil – they make plastic, they make diesel, petrol, they build amazing things with it,” he said.  Growth plans  Per Reiwe, the team has grown to eight people, and the round focused on founders and potential integration partners, avoiding “capital-only” firms and working closely with investors to ensure eventual product-market fit.  While Riewe and co-founder John Letey are just 21 and 16, respectively, Riewe says the community of early users and testers have been supportive and respectful as the project works through growing pains and occasional data hiccups.  “They tell us all the time, ‘Hey, we’ve been in testnet before too. These things happen,’” he said.  The team currently has plans for a utility token that will allow users to upload data and pay validators for confirming data validity as well as participating in the project’s decentralized governance process. According to Riewe, the team is targeting a token launch by the middle of next year.",POSITIVE,없음,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | SOL | AR,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/26/data-pipeline-protocol-kyve-raises-28m-from-industry-insiders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9e930379dd9ee67fe1a3b1880ea6fbbf1eb1166d-1600x1067.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The funding will help accelerate the development of the upcoming World of Sipheria play-to-earn game, which is expected to launch in December.  “The Sipher team, led by Tin Nguyen, is building a crypto-native metaverse with an intricate backstory and unique gaming experience,” wrote Arrington Capital in a blog post announcing the investment. “Sipher combines captivating cypherpunk ideals, crypto-native culture – such as the beloved Shiba Inu – and a comic-book art style in the crafting of its characters and virtual environments. Sipheria constructs a complex and rich lore around the factions and various species: the Inus, Toris, Nekos and Burus.”  Sipher was founded earlier this year by Tin Nguyen. The company previously launched its first non-fungible token (NFT) playable character, Sipherian Surge, which is now available for trading and secondary purchase on OpenSea.  World of Sipheria has two different play modes: adventure, where players can explore and complete quests, and Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, where players compete for stake, rewards and prestige.  The smallest unit of the 3D world is the Tile, which helps the game evolve. Types of Tiles include medical bays for healing Siphers after a battle, distilleries and workbenches for converting materials into consumable items for fights, and living quarters for displaying player assets, trophies and other NFTs.  “The significance of a player-owned virtual economy with real-world value cannot be understated.

Investors should “buy crypto’s general store,” he said.  Citi sees additional potential upside for the stock as the company expands its business beyond facilitating transactions.  The U.S. bank also sees the exchange’s “lean forward approach to regulatory compliance” as a prospective competitive advantage in the longer term and says that not all regulation should be seen as harmful. ”To a degree, we think rising regulations could be a positive for Coinbase’s competitive positioning, particularly versus business models that predominantly rely on markets being unregulated,” Citi said.  The stock and the company’s financial performance will both “likely incur a high degree of volatility” as Coinbase’s business model is directly correlated to the price of major crypto assets, Citi cautioned. That volatility makes forecasting and budgeting the business more difficult.  Citi is positive on the long-term outlook for blockchain technology and crypto markets in general and says that “the form of the so-called crypto economy will likely remain in debate for some time, though its proliferation, driven by an exceptionally large opportunity, is here to stay, in our view.”  Coinbase shares closed at $325.54 on Monday, 27% below Citi’s price target.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/26/citi-initiates-coverage-of-coinbase-with-415-price-target-says-buy-cryptos-general-store,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f7e0fd5d1b010382ac14dbe94e6493a20555f87-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While bitcoin and the broader crypto market appear to be in stasis at press time, FXS, a governance token of a lesser-known fractional-algorithmic stablecoin protocol, Frax, has jumped 80% in 24 hours.  You read that right: In a single day, the token has gained nearly twice more than what bitcoin has done so far this month, and is now trading near $14.40, according to data provided by Messari.  “People seem to be buying FXS from an already limited circulating supply to earn juicy yields from Tokemak’s dedicated reactor launch,” Alex Svanevik, CEO of blockchain data company Nansen told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat, referring to the Tokemak market-making protocol.  The analyst added that “75% of all circulating FXS [16,209,404.70] is locked away for an average of 1.08 years, circulating supply is heavily locked as veFXS (similar to veCRV).”  The Ethereum-based Frax stablecoin is partially collateralized, backed by both asset collateralization and cryptographic algorithms. The protocol utilizes two different assets: the Frax (FRAX) stablecoin built to maintain a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar, and the Frax Shares (FXS) governance and utility token.  A user can mint FRAX by supplying the USDC stablecoin as collateral, along with FXS token in amounts set by the Frax collateral ratio (CR). For instance, assuming a 50% collateral ratio, one FRAX can be generated by providing $0.50 USDC and $0.50 worth of FXS. On redemption, the user receives $0.50 USDC and $0.50 of FXS in exchange for every FRAX stablecoin provided. So, the demand for FXS is directly tied to investor appetite for FRAX.  Tokemak launched an FXS-dedicated token reactor on Tuesday, where FXS holders can deposit their coins in return for yield in the form of TOKE or tFXS tokens. These tFXS tokens represent the user’s claim on the assets deposited and can be redeemed anytime.  As of this writing, the annual percentage rate on FXS deposits is 47%, Tokemac’s website shows. That’s significantly higher than the 13% annualized return currently offered by bitcoin’s cash and carry arbitrage (buy spot and sell three-month futures).  Further, optimism surrounding the impending launch of Frax V3, considered by protocol founder Sam Kazemian as analogous to ETH 2.0, may be powering the FXS token higher.  “[With] upcoming Frax v3 - veFXS holders will directly control the algorithmic market operations (AMO) in terms of how FRAX supply expands and contracts when it comes to the peg,” Svanevik said. “So monetary policy will be done within the protocol and controlled by the veFXS holders, incentivizing more stability than just the old farming seigniorage model.”  Frax Finance describes veFXS as a vesting and yield system based on automated market maker Curve Finance’s veCRV mechanism.  “Users may lock up their FXS for up to 4 years for four times the amount of veFXS (e.g., 100 FXS locked for four years returns 400 veFXS). veFXS is not a transferable token nor does it trade on liquid markets. It is more akin to an account-based point system that signifies the vesting duration of the wallet’s locked FXS tokens within the protocol,” Frax Finance’s explainer says.",POSITIVE,USDC,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | USDC,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/26/fractional-algorithmic-stablecoin-protocol-fraxs-governance-token-fxs-surges-80-on-supply-squeeze,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/52ad260b96a4a27c8510f7f3fb94c582bd22c780-1400x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
