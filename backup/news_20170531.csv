A representative for has OKCoin confirmed a report today that withdrawals had resumed at the exchange, one of the largest in the world by volume. The spokesperson added, however, that withdrawals would be contingent on passing a verification requirement and prescribing to a $1m annual limit.  Still, signs suggest that OKCoin won't be alone in resuming operations.  According to a representative for the exchange, withdrawals could be opened at Huobi as soon as tomorrow. The representative also confirmed that OKCoin's withdrawals were being reactivated.  At press time, it remains unclear if fellow bitcoin exchange BTCC is on the cusp of resuming withdrawals as well. A representative for the startup did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Nonetheless, sources say the sudden change is the result of a thawing of sentiment at the People's Bank of China, which has been increasingly active on blockchain R&D and more understanding of bitcoin's role in the larger technology industry.  The exchange freeze, put in place amid an escalating price at the start of the year, has so far lasted for months, after China's exchanges – following warnings from regulators, including the People's Bank of China – froze withdrawals and began overhauling their systems.  Those upgrades were said to be completed in March.  Pete Rizzo contributed reporting.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BTCC.

42427572,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWSZh,1496253618,Judges Shoot Down Silk Road Operator's Appeal Bid,"Ross Ulbricht, who was sentenced to life in prison in 2015 for operating the now-defunct dark market Silk Road, has lost his appeal.  Ulbricht's appeal effort began last year after he was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole in May 2015. That landmark trial (not to mention its controversial nature) ended with Ulbricht being found guilty on seven charges, including ones related to narcotics trafficking, money laundering conspiracy and computer hacking.  In a 139-page decision, the three judges of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit shot down Ulbricht's argument that he was given an unfair trial, as well as his claim that the life sentence without parole was too harsh.  ""The district court gave Ulbricht's sentence the thorough consideration that it required, reviewing the voluminous sentencing submissions, analyzing the factors required by law, and carefully weighing Ulbricht's mitigating arguments,"" the judges wrote.  Ulbricht's lawyer, Joshua Dratel, declined to comment when reached.  The Silk Road was once the world's largest dark market, and an early stage for bitcoin's use as a payment method before it was taken offline in the fall of 2013 following a multi-agency investigation into the market.  It was later revealed that at least two agents involved in that investigation – both of whom have since been sentenced to prison terms – went rogue.

42427583,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWSvh,1496248815,$35 Million in 30 Seconds: Token Sale for Internet Browser Brave Sells Out,"Brave, the upstart web browser founded by Mozilla co-founder Brendan Eich, completed an initial coin offering (ICO) today that is likely to be distinguished for its speed and earnings.  Overall, the sale for Brave's ethereum-based Basic Attention Token (BAT) generated about $35m and was sold out within blocks, or under 30 seconds. One buyer went so far as to purchase 20,000 ETH (or about $4.7m) worth of tokens – designed to monetize online attention and create a new revenue source for publishers.  Another buyer paid more than $6,000 in ethereum mining fees to almost guarantee their place at the top of the line.  Still, that speed has apparently come with trade-offs.  Only around 130 people were able to buy the tokens today, with five buyers scooping up about half of the supply. The top 20 addresses in the token sale control more than two-thirds of all BAT, according to Joseph Lee, founder Magnr bitcoin exchange, who conducted a post-sale analysis.  The fast nature of the ICO has drawn some ire online from users that were hoping to buy into the token but were quickly shut out. However, the company has so far sought to portray the sale as a success.  Eich told CoinDesk:  ""We are pleased with the sale, and we're looking forward to disrupting digital advertising and building a user-centric platform for supporting the Web.""  A spokesperson later commented on frustrations around the sale, acknowledging some were naturally likely to be ""disappointed"" that they could not participate.  Still, the representative stressed that Brave has received ample positive feedback on the structure of its offering. The company published details of the pricing structure yesterday.  What now?  For those who haven't been following, token sales – by which blockchain-linked data is sold as a form or project crowdfunding – have been on the rise in 2017.  As such, the Brave sale is the latest in the growing popularity of ICOs, and its lightning fast sale is likely to draw more attention to the funding model, both from companies and regulators. Last week, for example, the popular messaging app Kik announced it would embark on a similar token offering, becoming one of the first mainstream brands to embrace the concept.  Looking ahead, Brave has said it will use its remaining tokens to fund basic ""grants"" for users in the future who may help improve the platform. (The company plans to release the open-source code for BAT on GitHub to foster the creation of a new ecosystem for publishers and readers based on this token.)  The browser is aiming to build a digital ad service around the token that cuts out third parties so that users pay BAT to publishers based on how long they browse and read a page. Brave itself will take a cut of these earnings.  Brave's next major challenge will be user and publisher adoption, though it hopes offering an incentive through the token will provided needed assistance.

42427594,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWT9h,1496247104,$236: Ethereum's Ether Token Hits New All-Time Price High,"The price of ether, the token that powers the ethereum blockchain, reached a new all-time high today, rising to what has become the latest in a string of record advancements.  Ether's price rose to as much as $236.97 at roughly 12:15 UTC, an increase of more than 35% in 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. At press time, the alternative asset protocol had fallen back very slightly, trading at an average of $235.01.  The price boost comes during an overall surge in the price of ether, climbing roughly 1,400% over the last three months amid the growing visibility of ethereum and a broader mainstream interest in cryptocurrencies.  Markets are also being buoyed by word of additional exchange listings. Huobi, one of the largest bitcoin exchanges in China, started offering trading in the CNY/ETH pair. The major Chinese exchange spoke to ether's potential, asserting that the cryptocurrency could surpass bitcoin in several areas in its official announcement.  While ether has been making progress toward greater adoption, its price has surged as cryptocurrencies in general have been drawing significant inflows, causing the total market cap of these assets to surpass $91bn earlier this month.  Amid this broader trend, ether has been differentiating itself from other cryptocurrencies, as its market cap recently surpassed 50% that of bitcoin's, a historically high figure.  By contrast, ether's market cap was less than 5% of the market cap of bitcoin at the start of the year.

42427585,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWSth,1496244637,Senators Call for Digital Currency Oversight in Anti-Money Laundering Bill,"A pair of US senators have filed a new anti-money laundering bill aimed at beefing up oversight of digital currency activities.  The bill – the Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Counterfeiting Act of 2017 – was filed last week by Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Senator Diane Feinstein of California.  Among the changes, according to a draft text of the bill, are additions to definitions for ""financial institutions"", which, if the bill is passed, would include ""any digital currency exchanger or tumbler"". Additionally, the bill clarifies that any ""issuer, redeemer or cashier"" of a ""digital currency"" is also covered.  While not explicitly spelled out as such, the bill moves bitcoin and other digital currencies closer to being defined as a ""monetary instrument"" under US anti-money laundering statutes, as it targets ""funds stored in a digital format"", according to a summary published by Grassley's office.  Beyond the regulatory adjustment, the bill seeks information from the US Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency about its policies on digital currencies.  Specifically, it calls for a report ""detailing a strategy to detect prepaid access devices and digital currency at border crossings and ports of entry"". This report – which would be due 18 months after the ostensible passage of the bill – is also required to include details about how such a strategy would be implemented.  The bill's release comes shortly after a member of the US House of Representatives called for a study into virtual currency use for terrorism financing.

42427587,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWSxh,1496239275,Spanish Banks Back 'Red Lyra' Blockchain Consortium,"A group of Spanish banks, law firms and corporations have formed a new blockchain consortium.  It's the second group effort launched in Spain in recent days, though some of the new members, which include law firms and utilities, signify a wider scope than one that is purely financial.  The newly minted consortium members are: Banco Sabadell, Banco Santander, Bankia, BBVA, BME, Caja Rural, Cajamar, Cepsa, Correos, Ejaso, Endesa, Everis, Garrigues, Gas Natural Fenosa, Grant Thornton, Iberdrola, Icade, MásMóvil, Momopocket, Notarnet, Roca Junyent and Scytl.  What they're doing: According to releases from some of those involved, the consortium is tackling a ""multi-sector"" strategy in the kinds of projects they focus on.  As explained BBVA, the first major undertaking will be centered around digital identity, with the bank saying:  ""The first project of the Lyra Network will focus on the development of a digital identification system that can be safely shared and comply with the requirements of Spanish regulation by all members of the network. Lyra will develop legal identification services or support contracts ( smart contracts ), hence it is particularly important that its founders include recognized law firms and legal experts.""  Why it matters: The news is the latest indication that Spain's business sector is throwing its weight behind the technology.  Just last week, a group of regional Spanish banks launched a collaborative effort around blockchain, and while it’s not quite which kind of products or services they might develop in tandem, Cecabank's comments about ""in-depth understanding"" suggests that, at the very least, they’re trying to learn more.  Indeed, some of those members – including Bankia and professional services firm Grant Thornton – are part of the new Red Lyra project as well.

42427575,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWSbh,1496233811,A Facebook Investor is Calling for Regulated ICO Investment Products,"An asset manager with stakes in Facebook, Google and Tesla is looking to diversify its portfolio into the cutting edge of investment, but a barrier of regulatory hurdles exists between the idea and its execution.  Two years ago, New York-based ARK Invest became the first firm of its kind to buy exposure to bitcoin. Now, its founder and CEO Catherine Wood has her eyes set on what she considers the next frontier – initial coin offerings (ICOs), or sales of blockchain protocol data she believes could appreciate in value.  Obstacles to an investment fund focused on these projects, however, include an uncertain tax climate and the fact that some consider the ICO model itself – which lets individuals gain exposure to investments without middlemen – as potentially disruptive to Ark Invest's own model.  But the single biggest issue facing Ark Invest and its peers may be a lack of trusts offered either on public exchanges or via over-the-counter options, according to Wood. As a result, Wood is calling for the creation of a trust that would assure a degree of due diligence had been done on a number of ICOs.  In conversation with CoinDesk Wood said:  ""We'd need someone to create a kind of a security backed by the ICOs or a group of ICOs. Then we'd have assurance that it’s passed all of the regulatory requirements that we need it to pass before we can invest in it.""  Unlike venture capital investors who have already begun to participate in ICOs (including Fred Wilson, Naval Ravikant and Tim Draper), Ark Invest and other ETF managers are required to comply with stringent investor protections.  But there's opportunity in navigating this hurdle. Since Ark Invest's initial bitcoin investment in 2015 via an exchange-traded trust, the weight of the investment had grown from 1% of its total portfolio to as much as 10% without any additional investments.  Unexplored territory  With such growth, Wood is now turning her attention to the ICO market. But she is no longer alone in offering bitcoin as part of an ETF.  SEC-registered Kinetics Mutual Funds now includes two funds with bitcoin exposure in excess of 2% each, and Acatis Datini's ValueFlex fund consists of a 5.3% bitcoin stake, its largest position. Further, since Ark first announced its bitcoin investment vehicle, the price of bitcoin has increased by 880% from $230 in September 2015 to around $2,300 today.  By comparison, the total number of ICO sales denominated in ethereum, waves and other blockchain asset platforms reached $103m last year, and between 1st January of this year and 10th May, 37 ICOs have already generated $136m in funds, according to ICO data provider Smith + Crown.  But before firms like XBT Provider, Revoltura and Vontobel will likely consider building a trust based on one or more of these token sales, Wood expects that more regulatory certainty will be required.  Specifically, she expressed concern over whether using one token to buy another token is an in-kind exchange and therefore not taxable, or if it constitutes a taxable event based on capital gains law.  ""I actually would like the IRS to weigh in on this,"" said Wood. ""I would like them to say this is an in-kind exchange and the capital gains are therefore not taxable. If they decide otherwise that is going to upset the apple cart here.""  Bridging worlds  In a sense, the transition from being an investor in disruptive technologies to being an investor in disruptive investment models has already begun. In spite of being prohibited from buying a stake in an ICO until a trust is created, Ark Invest is already building out its expertise in the field.  Since its earliest days in the world of digital assets, the firm has been sought after by startups looking for a more accurate way to appraise their valuation, according to Wood.  Increasingly, she said her firm is being contacted by entrepreneurs looking for more advanced valuation techniques that take into consideration the potential net savings to an industry by moving its transactions to a blockchain.  While Wood calls the work a ""bridge between financial services and the blockchain world"", she said her involvement in the tokens sales themselves will always be limited until someone else builds a bridge of a different sort.  She concluded:  ""We can’t buy them because they’re not financial securities, but I can see [us] in the ICO world, picking and choosing, because some of them are going to hit it big.""

42427581,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWSph,1496230216,Russia's Central Bank is Writing a New Bitcoin Law,"Russia's central bank is preparing new legislation focused on bitcoin and other digital currencies.  While the plan doesn't yet appear to be set in stone, reports indicate that the Bank of Russia is planning to recognize cryptocurrencies as digital goods, with the relevant tax to be applied. The legislation would also reportedly include language establishing how the government will surveil and regulate the domestic marketplace.  What they're saying: According to news sources Bloomberg and RBC, the details came out of a parliamentary hearing at which Olga Skorobogatova, deputy governor of the Bank of Russia, discussed her institution's work on new legislation.  Skorobogatova, on 25th May, reportedly said that legislation could be introduced in the Duma – Russia's national legislature – as early as next month.  While no transcript of the 25th May meeting was immediately available, both sources quoted comments by Skorobogatova from last year, when she called for some kind of taxation and legal recognition of cryptocurrencies.  Cryptocurrencies ""should be regulated, because volumes are increasing compared to the previous year. If people are engaged in this, they have to pay money for it, and we have to have a clear understanding of how to control this activity"", Skorobogatova said, as reported by Bloomberg.  In April, word emerged that a new legislative push had begun, but follow-up comments suggested that it might take more time than originally anticipated.  How we got here: Those watching the space for the past couple of years will know Russia has been moving ever closer toward some kind of legislative framework for digital currencies.  Initially, the government seemed primed to adopt a harsh stance regarding the creation of issuance of so-called ""money surrogates"". At one point, Russian officials publicly toyed with the idea of prison sentences for crimes associated with the tech.  That position has largely softened in recent months, accompanied by growing enthusiasm for blockchain among both officials from the Bank of Russia as well as the government itself.  Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, for example, has pushed for research into public applications of the tech.

42427589,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWT3h,1496226603,Tokenized Dollars: Singapore's Central Bank Details New Blockchain Trial,"Singapore's central bank has published new details of distributed ledger trial that saw it issue digital tokens tied to its national currency.  The report, released yesterday, details work conducted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in partnership with a group of domestic banks, along with professional services firm Deloitte and distributed ledger consortium R3. The publication comes months after R3 opened a research center in Singapore, initially launched in November.  The MAS report centers around 'Project Ubin' – an effort that, the authors say, seeks to launch ""a tokenized form of the Singapore Dollar (SGD) on a [distributed ledger]"".  According the institution, the first phase of the trial – conducted between mid-November and late December of last year – included elements drawn from the Bank of Canada's Project Jasper (a digital currency initiative that also involved R3). The Project Ubin initiative itself relied on a private ethereum network that was created for the test.  Those involved in the project also tested Quorum – a private ethereum implementation developed by JPMorgan – to assess its privacy management tools.  The overall outcome of the trial, according to MAS, was positive, with the report's authors saying Project Ubin's first phase ""was successful as it has brought together a wide range of parties"". Further, it managed to build a ""working interbank transfer prototype on a private ethereum network"".  Looking ahead, MAS hopes to expand on the Ubin concept and build further capabilities into the platform.  ""Future phases would focus on future operating model of Project Ubin, further technical analysis, focus on securities settlement by developing DvP and Cross-border payments (PvP),"" MAS said.

42427576,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWShh,1496223009,Bitcoin's 'Segwit2x' Scaling Proposal: Where the Startups Stand,"New information is coming out about a proposal that some hope could lead to a long-awaited increase to bitcoin's transaction capacity, a stagnant feature that many in the community believe is holding back the cryptocurrency's growth and utility.  Although there have been past efforts aimed at putting an end to bitcoin's two-year scaling debate, the new 'agreement' has perhaps earned unprecedented support from companies and mining pool operators, with over 50 bitcoin companies and firms representing more than 80% of bitcoin's mining power signing the proposal.  The goal, according to the announcement blog post released last week, is to move forward with two changes: an optimization called Segregated Witness and a 2MB block size increase. Although, the latter is arguably the main point of contention, since it could potentially lead to the creation of two bitcoin networks if not all users agree with the change.  Beyond that, though, details have been thin. The community and even some of the participants were at least initially confused about aspects of the plan: Which upgrade is supposed to come first? Where's the code? Do supporters think it will lead to a network split? (Is that the goal?)  However, new details are coming out which might not totally clarify the situation, but help show how companies involved are thinking about these questions.  One new development is that participants are beginning to put together code – another point that sets the proposal apart from past attempts to come to a consensus on a solution, such as one widely known as the Hong Kong agreement.  For example, while bitcoin technology company BitGo did not sign the new agreement, the company has ""pledged technical resources"" to formalize it into working code.  ""The plan we're putting together is laser-focused on building a deployable [minimum viable product] for our mission ... All work will be done in the open, and we welcome constructive debate,"" BitGo co-founder and CEO Mike Belshe wrote in a leaked email describing a rough roadmap called 'Segwit2x'.  (BitGo did not respond to CoinDesk's requests about its involvement in the effort.)  The roadmap tentatively schedules the first software version release for 16th June, at which point the open-source community can give their feedback. If all goes according to plan, bitcoin users will be able to download the new, finalized bitcoin software about a month later on 21st July.  The three-day-old implementation so far includes contributions from Bloq co-founder and Bitcoin Core contributor Jeff Garzik. (Perhaps it's worth noting that some of the technical feedback has been critical and partly politicized, so far.)  Other developers, such have Lightning Network co-inventor Joseph Poon, have also expressed an interest in contributing to help build a safe, new version.  Strong agreement  Against this backdrop, some participants initially seemed not to agree, or at least were confused by the terms of the agreement.  However, when contacted, companies involved largely seem to be on the same page. Though initial feedback from the community was mixed, all companies that responded said that they agree to move forward with the proposal.  ""I think it's an important step towards breaking a stalemate that is causing bitcoin to stagnate,"" said Joshua Scigala, CEO of bitcoin-gold exchange Vaultoro, though he mentioned that he would have liked to have seen ""a couple of more months to prepare"".  Valery Vavilov, CEO of blockchain technology company Bitfury Group, told CoinDesk that the agreement ""has not changed"" in light of community responses, and SFOX co-founder and developer Akbar Thobhani said much the same.  Others were more diplomatically short on the matter.  ""We understand there are different visions for bitcoin among the community, and Coinbase is supportive of both on- and off-chain scaling improvements,"" said a company representative.  That said, several companies on the list, including DCG and its subsidiaries, Purse, Blockchain and Xapo declined to comment.  Bitcoin Core?  Following the proposal release, one of the key points of community contention is that Bitcoin Core contributors, the volunteer developers behind bitcoin's primary software, were absent from the meeting and the signed agreement. Some of these developers stated in the aftermath of the proposal that they don't think the plan is technically viable and that the timeline is too short.  Others have gone as far as to argue that the agreement is a political move – a way to replace Bitcoin Core developers, who work on a volunteer basis, with another team.  On this note, some companies mentioned that they are simply frustrated with the lack of scaling progress. For one, since transaction capacity has remained stagnant, transaction fees have swelled, affecting users and businesses.  “Many Bitcoin Core developers stopped listening to businesses, miners and users over two years ago. If they are unwilling to compromise, then the compromise will move forward without them,” said Yours CEO Ryan X Charles, adding:  ""We will continue to support the proposal even if developers do not.""  Genesis Mining co-founder and CEO Marco Streng shared a similar sentiment.  ""We're supporting bitcoin – and it goes without saying that the individuals responsible for bitcoin will change as the project ages. We'll support these individuals (or groups), whomever they may be,"" he said.  SFOX's Thobhani suggested that the release of the rough proposal is just a first step that could lead to wider consensus.  ""This is a process and not a stance,"" he said. ""I am hopeful that through this process we will identify a way to discuss different views and find a path forward.""  On the other hand, some signed the agreement with the idea that they would like the team to stay onboard.  ""We really hope the agreement will ultimately reunite the community. Having the Bitcoin Core developers aboard is a vital part of the plan for Bitwala,"" a representative from Bitwala said.  “We have the utmost respect for the Bitcoin Core developers and we are working to create an agreement and technical roadmap that suits everyone and is best for the future of bitcoin,” Vavilov said.  Onward with a split  Participants that responded also appear to agree that the proposal, including the hard fork, will happen.  ""If a hard fork is the only way to solve the scaling problems – among other issues – then that is how it has to be,"" as Streng put it.  But, following the change, companies have different ideas about what the outcome will be.  ""We believe a hard fork with roughly 75% support from business, miners and users would be strong enough that it would thrive even in the midst of two competing chains,"" Charles said.  Others think that two chains are unlikely to survive, with the new 'Segwit2x' coin pulling in the majority of the bitcoin ecosystem.  ""Strong consensus is needed to initiate the hard fork, so seriously competing chains are unlikely. Probably the less popular chain would remain a niche,"" said MONI marketing lead Ilkka Montin.  Some feel that the 2MB component is a critical piece.  ""We're at a point where SegWit alone won’t be enough for the current needs of the network,"" said Ripio CEO and co-founder Sebastian Serrano.  On the other hand, some companies mentioned that they also support other methods of deploying SegWit on its own, which has stalled due to lack of support from mining pool operators. In this way, some see another controversial proposal, called UASF (for 'user-activated soft fork'), as another potential way forward.  Scigala said that his company is looking at how to ""safely participate"".  Although it’s complex, the downside, like with a hard fork, is that the method of upgrading bitcoin could also lead to a chain split. One difference, according to UASF advocates (who appear to be moving forward with what they call a bitcoin ""Independence Day"" slated for 1st August) is that a soft fork is a backwards-compatible change, while a hard fork isn’t.  ""Nobody in the community would deny that scaling is needed.
