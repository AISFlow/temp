To test this, MyCrypto's researcher ran the generator in bulk and got some odd results.    ""Approaching from a different angle, we then used the “Bulk Wallet” generator to generate 1,000 keys. In the non-malicious, GitHub version, we are given 1,000 unique keys, as expected.      However, using WalletGenerator.net at various times between May 18, 2019 — May 23, 2019, we would only get 120 unique keys per session. Refreshing our browser, switching VPN locations, or having a different party perform the same test would result in a different set of 120 keys being generated.""    While the odd behavior was not found as of last Friday (May 24), it could be return at any time.  ""We’re still considering this highly suspect and still recommending users who generated public / private keypairs after August 17, 2018, to move their funds,"" the researcher says. ""We do not recommend using WalletGenerator.net moving forward, even if the code at this very moment is not vulnerable.""  You can read the entire report here, but Denley recommends moving funds off of your WalletGenerator-based paper wallets. As there is no clear way to contact the ""two random guy [sic] having fun with a side project"" who apparently run the site, we can safely recommend you avoid the site altogether.

42381950,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qKBV,1558972829,0x Teams With StarkWare to Bring Speed to Decentralized Exchanges,"A cryptographic solution called zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) could help notoriously slow decentralized exchanges (DEXs) reach speeds comparable to more traditional platforms.  San Francisco-based DEX startup 0x is partnering with the Israeli software-as-service company StarkWare to test a ZKP solution called StarkDEX, which can process roughly 500 transactions per second.  StarkWare CEO Uri Kolodny told CoinDesk the goal is clear: “Non-custodial trading at scale.”  Speaking to how ZKPs could be implemented in the 0x DEX ecosystem, 0x marketing lead Matt Taylor told CoinDesk:  “Our goal is that by the end of this year we’ll have this in production, on mainnet, so that people can actually use this technology. … We intend to have this be a core part of the 0x DEX stack.”  Taylor said the 0x system has facilitated 713,000 trades for a volume of about $1 billion since it was founded in 2017. DEXs using 0x currently process between a few hundred and roughly 3,100 trades a day, according to 0xtracker.com, but scaling continues to be a challenge.  “A marketplace where only three trades per second can be settled is a very illiquid market,” Kolodny said of some networks' current limitations.  Still, Kolodny told CoinDesk it will take months before this alpha test leads to a professional service for 0x relayers and other blockchain companies.  Stepping back, StarkWare attracted investment from ConsenSys Ventures, ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and the Zcash company, to name a few. This startup’s ZKP expertise and solutions are so sought after that the Technion University, where StarkWare co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson also works as a professor, filed a lawsuit claiming Ben-Sasson is “getting rich” from the university’s intellectual property.  Regardless of legal disputes, the aim of StarkWare’s latest partnership is to enhance scalability across the industry. Taylor said 0x plans to use StarkDEX solutions to “scale our infrastructure as well as the infrastructure for the rest of the crypto economy.”  In September, ethereum heavyweights like Buterin will gather in Tel Aviv for a series of technical sessions hosted by StarkWare.  Said Kolodny:  “If we provide scalability engines for trading, or gaming, or any application that one wishes to run on the blockchain, you can use [StarkWare] computation that takes everything else you’re doing off-chain and achieve massive scale.”  Correction (May 28, 13:22 UTC): The 0x system has facilitated approximately 713,000 trades since 2017, not $713,000 in volume, as was previously reported. The story has been updated.

42381970,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qKZP,1558971030,Golden Crossover: XRP Heads for Bullish Chart Pattern as Price Climbs 27%,"XRP is teasing a long-term bullish reversal, with a surge in price and a bullish chart pattern likely to occur next week.  The world’s third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $0.413 on Bitfinex, representing a 27 percent gain on the opening price of $0.3249 seen May 1.  If prices stay above the current level till May 31, the resulting monthly gain would be the biggest since September 2018. Back then, the cryptocurrency had rallied 73 percent from $0.3350 to $0.5820.  The rally seen this month appears modest in front of the stellar gains registered in September 2018. The cryptocurrency, however, may produce much bigger gains in the following months as a widely tracked long-term technical indicator is about to turn bullish.  The upward sloping 50-day moving average (MA), currently at $0.3434, looks set to cross above the 200-day MA, currently at $0.3470, in the next few days.  That would confirm a “golden crossover” – a pattern which indicates long-term bullish reversal, according to technical analysis theory. Many experts, however, call it a lagging indicator, as the MA studies are based on historical data.  An impending golden crossover, therefore, could be considered a product of XRP’s rise from the April 25 low of $0.2825 to the recent high of $0.4787 rather than a hint of further gains.  That said, XRP is still down 87 percent from the record of $3.30 reached on Jan. 4, 2018 and far from being overbought. The golden crossover, therefore, may invite chart-driven buying, leading to the next leg higher in the cryptocurrency.  Daily chart  As seen above, the 50-day MA is fast closing on the 200-day MA.  The crossover confirmation could be followed by a convincing break above the recent high of $0.4787 as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is currently biased bullish at 61.00 and well short of the overbought territory (above-70).  Further, the Chaikin money flow index (CMF) is printing positive, indicating strong buying pressure.  Weekly chart  XRP jumped 34 percent in seven days to May 19, validating seller exhaustion seen near $0.28 in the first 4.5-months.  So far, however, the follow-through to that bearish-to-bullish trend change has not been bullish. In fact, the cryptocurrency formed a hanging man candle last week – a bearish development.  The outlook, however, would again turn from bullish-to-bearish only if the price ends below $0.3593 at this Sunday's close (UTC).

EY Has Built a Blockchain for That,"“Big Four” professional services firm EY has built a blockchain platform for a firm that will help consumers determine wines' quality, provenance and authenticity.  The TATTOO Wine Platform has been developed for Blockchain Wine Pte. Ltd. using EY’s OpsChain solution, EY announced on Thursday.  The platform is backed by Asian wine cellar The House of Roosevelt, which will use it to sell wines directly from vineyards to hotels, restaurants, cafes and customers, according to the announcement.  EY said:  “Each bottle of wine will be ‘tattooed’ with its own unique QR code. By scanning the QR code, participants can access information such as vineyards’ names and locations, details such as the types of fertilizers used to grow the crops, and how each batch is transported for processing and delivery.”  The platform will focus on markets in Asia where the consumption of European wines is expanding, EY said. Over 5,000 labels will be added to the system, including wines from France, Italy, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, South America and California.  TATTOO has been built using the ethereum’s ERC-721 standard for non-fungible tokens, or crypto collectibles, according to the announcement. (Yes, basically, the wine tokens are like alcohol-based CryptoKitties.)  The asset traceability module of EY OpsChain has been used to tokenize over 11 million bottles of wine for various clients, as well as toher consumables. EY said.  As well as providing data on wine provenance, TATTOO also allows consumers and distributors to buy and sell wine, schedule and track shipments, monitor warehousing and delivery, and arrange for and track insurance coverage of wine shipments, EY said.  Taking a slightly different tack, blockchain startup VinX is also developing a supply chain platform for trading wine futures, which allow connoisseurs and collectors to purchase a vintage while it’s still in the barrel, a year or two before it’s bottled and released on the market.

Released  Friday, the kit provides a variety of resources, including information on the skills needed to find work as an ethereum blockchain and decentralized application (dapp) developer.  JavaScript, Python and Solidity programming languages will help developers build on ethereum, ConsenSys said, while knowledge of languages such as Go, Rust, Java,.NET, C++ and Ruby will help backend or protocol development on the blockchain network.  The kit also offers a glossary section on key blockchain and cryptography terms such as consensus algorithms, sharding, token standards and hash functions, as well as providing links on the places devs can start their search for employment. These include Blocktribe and Gitcoin.co, as well as more standard sites such as Indeed.com.  Citing LinkedIn’s emerging jobs list for 2018, ConsenSys said that blockchain development skills are in high demand, with related job listings have seen a 33-times increase in just a year.  “Companies hiring range from small remote teams to VC-funded startups to industry leaders and tech giants,” the firm said.  Citing another study by professional services firm PwC, ConsenSys said that 77 percent of companies are well on their way towards taking blockchain-based solutions and products into production, while only 14 percent currently have no plans to integrate blockchain.  Opinions on blockchain, distributed networks, and web3 are also “rapidly changing” amongst software developers building on web2, ConsenSys said, citing another report from Deloitte, which said a majority (67.6 percent) of developers maintained a positive opinion on blockchain tech.  Back in 2017, ConsenSys also launched an academy to help developers learn more about the blockchain ecosystem.  All this comes despite recent reports of layoffs at crypto and blockchain firms as the crypto bear market downturn made its effects felt across business models and revenues. Firms and organizations such as Bitmain, the NEM foundation, and, indeed, Consensys, all felt forced to cut staffing levels in the last several months.

42420841,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWZERp,1558954826,"Bitcoin Price Backs Off 12 Month Highs, But Bias Remains Bullish","View  Bitcoin has retraced slightly from the one-year high of $8,940 reached earlier today.  Any pullbacks could be short-lived, however, as buying pressure is currently the strongest in over five months, according to a weekly chart indicator.  A pennant breakout on the daily chart indicates scope for a rally to $10,000 in the near-term. On the way higher, BTC may encounter resistance at the key Fibonacci level of $9,442.  The bullish case would weaken if prices fall back below $8,000 in the next day or two.  Bitcoin (BTC) has pulled back from 12-month highs hit earlier today. However, the bulls are still firmly in control, with the price holding well above key support at $8,390.  The cryptocurrency market leader jumped to $8,940 on Bitstamp at 01:00 UTC today, the highest level since May 11, 2018.  The rally since then has faded somewhat, with the cryptocurrency currently trading at $8,750, representing a 9 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  The $200 drop from intraday highs seen over the last nine hours is likely nothing more than a bull breather, often seen following a notable price gain. After all, BTC rose by 8.29 percent on Sunday – the fourth biggest single-day gain of May.  More importantly, the bulls finally managed to force a convincing break above $8,300, having failed at least three times in the preceding 11 days to hold on to gains above that psychological level.  Prices also found acceptance above the July 2018 high of $8,500 yesterday.  So, the rally from lows below $6,000 looks to have resumed and only a quick fall back below $8,000 would weaken the bullish case.  Daily chart  BTC closed well above the May 16 high of $8,390 on Sunday, confirming a pennant breakout – a continuation pattern that usually accelerates the preceding bullish move.  This type of breakout is often followed by a move upwards of roughly the length of the pennant's ""pole"" (the height of the preceding bull move) – in this case from $5,562 to $8,390).  BTC, therefore, has scope to rally at least to $10,000 (psychological resistance) in the near-term.  Supporting the bullish case is the Chaikin money flow index of 0.24 – the highest reading since April 10 – meaning that buying pressure is its strongest in nearly six weeks.  Further, the 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are trending north, indicating a short-term bullish setup. As a result, these averages, currently located at $8,288 and $8,048, respectively, and may reverse price pullbacks, if any.  Weekly chart  BTC’s four-week winning run is backed by five-month highs on the Chaikin money flow index – that is, buying pressure is currently the strongest since mid-December,  The 5- and 10-week MAs are also sloping upwards in favor of the bulls.  While the relative strength index (RSI) is reporting overbought conditions with an above-70 print, the cryptocurrency is showing no signs of bullish exhaustion. The RSI’s overbought signal therefore stands invalidated.  To conclude, BTC will likely break above $9,000 in the short-term and may rise to $9,442 – the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from the December 2017 high to December 2017 low.  It's worth noting that prices are currently up more than 65 percent on a month-to-date basis. Pullbacks due to profit taking are usually observed following such stellar rallies.  As a result, the possibility of BTC revisiting the former resistance-turned-support zone of $8,390–$8,000 before rising to $9,442 cannot be ruled out.  On a year-to-date basis, bitcoin is now up 136 percent.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

The bankruptcy court in the Southern District of New York issued an order to Cryptopia on Friday, granting an emergency motion for provisional relief till June 7.  Grant Thornton said:  “The interim order preserves the Cryptopia data, which includes a SQL database containing all account holders’ individual holdings of cryptocurrencies and the account holder contact details. Without this information, reconciling individual holdings with the currencies held by Cryptopia will be impossible.”  The process of recovering the data and determining how to make distributions to account holders will take “some months at least,” the liquidator said.  According to a report from Bloomberg, the Arizona firm is terminating services with Cryptopia and is seeking $2 million in compensation. If that money is not forthcoming, the report suggests, the exchange's liquidators fear the vital user data could be lost irretrievably.  Cryptopia was hit by a major hack in mid-January resulting in “significant losses.” Later, it restarted trading services amid banking issues, and finally went into liquidation and suspended trading operations earlier this month.  A blockchain data analytics firm estimated after the hack that as much as $16 million in ether and ERC-20 tokens could have lost.  Grant Thornton was expected to file an initial report on the case last week on the New Zealand Companies Office website. But the New Zealand Court granted a 10 working day extension and the report is now due on June 4, Cryptopia said last week.

42381966,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qKUN,1558947615,"Public Perceptions of the Bitcoin Spot Market Are Wrong, Says Bitwise","Today's bitcoin spot market is “significantly smaller and significantly more efficient” than is generally perceived, argues Bitwise Asset Management.  In a white paper presented as comment to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday, Bitwise said the quality of the bitcoin spot market and the strength of arbitrage in that market has “improved dramatically” since the start of 2018.  The average deviation of bitcoin's price on the 10 ""real"" bitcoin exchanges, as measured against the consolidated price, shows a downward trend, indicating increasingly efficient arbitrage between the various exchanges, the firm said.  “This comes despite high volatility and (at times) declining overall trading volume, and is driven by a large number of factors that reflect the growing maturity of the space,” it added.  The CME bitcoin futures market has also been steadily growing, Bitwise said.  Further, reiterating the major point of its previous report, the firm said that roughly 95 percent of all reported bitcoin trading volume is either fake volume or wash-trading. The volume numbers reported by CoinMarketCap and other data aggregators are “wrong” and “wildly inflated,” the firm argued. It did, however, concede that CoinMarketCap has ""embarked on a serious initiative to improve transparency, disclosure and accuracy.""  On the other hand, the ""real"" bitcoin market is “extremely efficient,” Bitwise said: “After you remove the fake volume and fake data from the equation, you are left with an extremely efficient and orderly market, and one that is backstopped by a regulated derivatives market of significant size.”  It continued:  ""Public perception, however, holds nearly the opposite point-of-view, believing the bitcoin market to be uniquely disorderly and inefficient.""  According to the paper, Binance, Bitfinex, Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, BitFlyer, Gemini, itBit, Bittrex, and Poloniex are the only 10 exchanges with real trading volumes, with numbers that align more easily with related real-world statistics, including gross domestic product, wealth, web traffic and blockchain-related venture investments.  In its conclusion, the firm said:  ""In times of rapid change, people’s perceptions often anchor in the past. People who read about bitcoin today still think about Mt. Gox, when they should be thinking about Fidelity; they think about Silk Road, when they should be thinking about Whole Foods. This vestigial anchoring is made worse by the poor quality of data that permeates large parts of the bitcoin ecosystem, which can create the perception that the market remains inefficient, chaotic and issue-prone.""  The white paper comes less than two weeks after the SEC once again delayed a decision on whether to approve or reject Bitwise's bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal filed with NYSE Arca. The regulator has yet to approve any bitcoin ETFs, though experts in the space and officials with the agency seem to believe that it’s only a matter of time before a proposal ticks all the right boxes.

42381956,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qKHn,1558944029,The Cat-and-Mouse Game of Crypto Regulation Enters a New Phase,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.      In the relentless cat-and-mouse game between regulators and cryptocurrency developers, the cats are about to add some serious firepower – this time in the form of a global alliance.  But if you think the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force’s forthcoming know-your-customer (KYC) compliance standards spell the end for the mice, think again. If anything, the FATF’s move, expected to be released next month, will drive developers to accelerate work on non-custodial exchanges and other tools that will make it easier for end-users to transact directly outside of regulated intermediaries.  As CoinDesk managing editor Marc Hochstein explained last week , the new rules are likely to require exchanges and other custodial entities that take custody of their customers’ cryptocurrency to obtain identifying information about both parties before allowing a transaction over their platforms.  Functioning much like the FATF’s “travel rule” for correspondent banks, the new regulatory approach would be backed by the task force member institutions’ unique powers to “graylist”– and ultimately blacklist – entire countries if they are judged to be non-compliant.  When combined with the European Union’s forthcoming AMLD5 anti-money laundering rules for cryptocurrencies, the new framework conjures up the image of an all-encompassing global system for cryptocurrency transactions in which no one user is unaccounted for.  ‘Satoshi’s vision’ destroyed?  Libertarian-minded cryptocurrency believers will view this as an abominable surveillance system that contravenes the censorship-resistant principles upon which bitcoin was built.  From a practical perspective, the new rules are going to be a burdensome imposition on custody-handling exchanges. It may well spur industry consolidation as smaller players may find the compliance costs too high. Blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, which counts regulatory agencies among its clients, argued in a submission to the FATF that the new rules are impractical and would drive more activity in cryptocurrencies into services that make it much harder for authorities to track illicit activity.  The rules could also, sadly, add to the “de-risking” problem that excludes billions of under-identified people in developing countries from the global financial system.  But all is not lost. In most countries, there is nothing illegal about holding cryptocurrency itself under your own custody. And, as was clarified in guidelines recently published by the Financial Crime Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, the world’s regulatory institutions won’t, for now at least, be imposing the same KYC requirements on providers of self-custody wallet software.  What is likely to emerge, then, in parallel to the FATF-regulated ecosystem of regulated custody-taking institutions, is an entirely separate economy of peer-to-peer exchanges among people who control their own cryptocurrency.  If you hold your coins with Coinbase, you will no longer be able to send or receive crypto to or from just any old bitcoin address if it has been through a KYC process. Once you move your funds into a non-custodial account, you’ll be free to send them to any self-custody address, but if you’ve never formally associated your identity with that address via a regulated entity, you won’t be able to transact with a Coinbase address or one administered by any other regulated custody provider.  The point, though, is that this otherwise draconian regulatory framework still leaves room for Satoshi’s vision of a peer-to-peer payments system. And with more work on technical and business model development, that system could still become sizable.  In fact, the new rules could be a catalyst for developers to more urgently tackle the core technical and logistical challenges that have limited the adoption of self-custody cryptocurrency wallets. These challenges fall under the categories of security, market coordination and fiat on-ramps, all three of which are currently showing significant progress.  Security  A key incentive for people to hold their cryptocurrency with custodial services such as Coinbase has been an unwillingness to risk either misplacing their private keys or having them stolen. Stories of hacks and loss abound and have long discouraged newbies from “being their own bank.”  In recent years, secure hardware wallets such as Ledger and Trezor have made it easier for people to control their assets without exposing their private keys to online hackers. But security experts claim to have found vulnerabilities. And the user experience is still far from convenient for the non-savvy.  Still, a new generation of smartphones that employ military grade security and end-to-end encryption should make it easier to securely hold cryptocurrency, locally, on a device that easily connects to the Internet for global payments. HTC led the way in this technology. Samsung is now catching up.  Phone makers are employing sophisticated, locally stored biometric proofs to indelibly tie control to a user. When combined with multi-signature technologies, human-friendly key recovery solutions such seed phrases kept with trusted associates, and a bit of education, the risk of loss can be reduced to an immaterial level.  Other changes to the ecosystem, such as decentralized insurance programs and more aggressive measures to hold phone carriers to account for “SIM swap” attacks such as the one that led Michael Terpin into a lengthy legal battle with a hacker and AT&T, will also boost confidence.  Over time, more and more people are going to feel more comfortable managing their own key custody.  Market coordination and fiat on-ramps  The next challenge is to reduce the widespread dependence on custody-based exchanges.  Cryptocurrency users need to efficiently find buyers and sellers, and until now, that has left them dependent on centralized exchanges, which are key targets of the new regulations.  The answer lies in the rapidly growing field of decentralized exchanges, where custody is retained by the investor and where technologies such as atomic swaps allow seamless peer-to-peer transfer of assets without either party being able to defraud the other.  As a nascent technology, DEXs currently struggle to attract the liquidity of the larger centralized exchanges, which makes them less attractive. But with Binance having launched a beta version, there is likely to be rapid development in this space.  Meanwhile, Boston-based startup Arwen has launched a protocol that would give investors access to the matching engines of large centralized exchanges but allows them to retain custody through a smart contract solution that locks up their coins in escrow. KuCoin has integrated a beta version of the technology into its exchange.  Even if decentralized exchanges and self-custody trading can help crypto-to-crypto transactions stay out of the regulatory net, they won’t solve the related problem of access to fiat currency. For the moment, that’s a service that has been almost solely provided by regulated, centralized exchanges.  The solution lies with the new batch of stablecoins, where dollar-pegged tokens such MakerDAO’s algorithmic solution, Dai, are competing with reserves-backed stablecoins such as those of Gemini, Paxos and a consortium led by Circle and Coinbase.  In theory, there’s nothing technical stopping these stable-value tokens from moving in and out of unidentified self-custody wallets, which offers a way around the fiat on-ramp problem by enabling access to de facto dollars, if not actual dollars. Only when users redeem them for actual greenbacks via the token-issuing companies will they drop into a regulated environment and have to identify themselves.  Facebook vs banks?  Now, all these services must be underpinned by real fiat resources, which means that stablecoin providers and DEX software providers will still need bank accounts. And given banks’ ongoing reluctance to support cryptocurrency businesses, obtaining them could be a potential obstacle to startups looking to grow of this ecosystem.  In this way, banks could continue to be the wedge with which regulators impose limits on the otherwise unregulated cryptocurrency industry.  But as I’ve argued elsewhere , banks’ growing interest in other blockchain developments, such as in making markets in tokenized equity and bond offerings, is going to induce them to support tokenized payments. This will eventually demand a more friendly approach to some of these service providers, especially stablecoins.  Most banks won’t want to cede the future of digital fiat payments to a competing bank such as JPMorgan , and they’ll be reluctant to let Facebook turn its more than 2 billion active users into an instant global payment network that bypasses banks. Ironically, that could draw them closer to rebel providers of these self-custody-enabling services.  The Tom and Jerry show will continue, in other words. Don’t change the dial.

At 19:00 UTC on May 26, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization broke from an ascending triangle pattern on the daily chart, after being held beneath $8,250 for an extended period of time.  The move to fresh 2019 highs comes after the bitcoin price dropped to as low as $6,600 on May 17 before a large amount of buying pressure pushed prices back above $7,300 within the same day.  Since then the bitcoin price has again jumped by 22 percent, rising above $8,500 around 19:45 UTC on Sunday night and then reaching over $8,700 within half an hour. It's currently changing hands at $8,890 per CoinDesk's price data.  Notably, the price rally was also accompanied by a large uptick in the 24-hour trading volume, an increase of $10.3 billion was added overall, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  However, its “Real 10” volume – a metric that takes into account trading volume from exchanges reporting honest volume figures as identified in a report by Bitwise Asset Management – currently stands at $3.1 billion, according to Messari.io.  Meanwhile, other highly ranked cryptocurrencies like EOS, Ether (ETH), XRP, and litecoin (LTC) have gained between 5.3 to 5.8 percent each on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinMarketCap.  What’s more, the total market capitalization has risen to a high of $268.1 billion its highest point since August 3, 2018 while the market capitalization for altcoins is up $6 billion, a sign of continued funding and investment for cryptocurrencies overall.  Eyes are now firmly set on bitcoin’s new target along $9,650 resistance, last seen 13 months ago on April 30, 2018, signaling a very strong upward move beyond the $10,000 psychological price tag.
