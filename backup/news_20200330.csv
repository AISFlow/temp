The removal cuts off Voatz‚Äô access to HackerOne‚Äôs network of ‚Äúethical hackers‚Äù who trade their expertise in finding code faults for cash. HackerOne partners with corporations interested in shoring up potential security vulnerabilities. Across 1,800 total relationships and eight years, though, it's never before kicked a partner out, said representative Samantha Spielman.      The news was first reported Monday by CyberScoop.      Spielman said Voatz‚Äô breach of ‚Äúpartnership standards‚Äù made the relationship unviable, despite the program‚Äôs past bug-hunting successes.      ‚ÄúAs a platform, we work tirelessly to foster that mutually beneficial relationship between security teams and the researcher community,‚Äù she said. Spielman declined to elaborate on Voatz‚Äô standards breach.      Voatz told CoinDesk in a statement it regrets the relationship‚Äôs ‚Äútemporary pause.‚Äù It said that HackerOne had caved to a ‚Äúsmall group of researchers who, along with a few other members of the community, believe Voatz reported a researcher to the FBI.‚Äù      ‚ÄúThis falsehood and misinformation has been a source of animosity toward Voatz and our partners, who face consistent attacks from these researchers,‚Äù the statement said.      West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner said in October 2019 the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating an attempted breach of the app during a pilot program in 2018. West Virginia has used the app in multiple pilots, and Warner maintains that no votes have been altered to date.    Rocky year    Voatz came under the spotlight in mid-February when a group of MIT researchers released a scathing write-up highlighting myriad apparent security flaws in the app. They alleged Voatz was essentially bunk, criticized its transparency and called up election officials considering the app to maybe think twice.      Voatz responded with its own criticism. In a sarcasm-laced Feb. 13 press release, it called the researchers‚Äô report unfair and their ‚Äúbad faith recommendations‚Äù irreparably flawed.      However, earlier this month Trail of Bits published a report supporting the MIT researchers' claims. Voatz had commissioned Trail of Bits to analyze its platform.      Voatz began working with HackerOne in August 2018 and has paid out over $6,000 to researchers through ‚ÄúHackerOne and other avenues‚Äù since. It plans to announce its own bounty program ‚Äúin the coming days.‚Äù      West Virginia has dropped its partnership with the company.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | SPONSORED,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/30/election-app-voatz-just-got-kicked-out-of-a-major-bug-bounty-program,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5f405557098da98d75720c8083855ceff9d14a23-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383513,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w9AT,1585600429,Bitcoin Follows Stock Markets Higher; How Long Will They Move in Lockstep?,"After the weekend slump, many cryptocurrencies made strong gains Monday, as did major stock indexes, while the coronavirus continues to wreak havoc on the global economy.      Traders weren‚Äôt confident the green flashing across all markets would last, however.      Bitcoin (BTC) climbed 8 percent and ether (ETH) gained 6 percent. Other notable performers include bitcoin SV up 11 percent, bitcoin cash (BCH) in the green 8 percent and IOTA (IOTA) gaining 8 percent. These 24-hour price changes are as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET).      Japan‚Äôs Nikkei 225 Index saw heavy selling during the open hour of trading but climbed back and ended the session down down a modest 1.5 percent. This followed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announcing Friday that Japan would introduce a fiscal stimulus larger than the 56.8 trillion yen ($526 billion) injection the country required in the 2008 crisis.      See also: USD Stablecoins Are Surging, but Zero Interest Rates Complicate Business Model      In Europe, the FTSE 100 index closed up 1.7 percent, while the U.S. S&P 500 rose 3.3 percent. Tuesday will close out the first quarter of 2020, so traders are unsure whether the traditional markets will continue to make gains because the end of an accounting period is typically a time to rebalance portfolios.      ‚ÄúI think we see equities much lower so it will be interesting to see if bitcoin follows,‚Äù said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank.    ‚ÄòStill largely correlated‚Äô    Bitcoin came under selling pressure late last week, not long after the U.S. markets closed at 20:00 UTC Friday. It dropped from $6,672 at 23:00 UTC that day to as low at $5,853 1:00 UTC Monday on exchanges like Coinbase.      However, shortly after the Nikkei slid and rebounded, bitcoin began climbing, entering $6,300 territory by 12:00 UTC.      ""Bitcoin is still largely correlated with financial markets overall it seems,‚Äù said Jack Tan, founding partner of Taiwan-based crypto trading firm Kronos Research. ‚ÄúAnd from what I can tell, we are still headed lower in stocks so bitcoin will presumably follow. Also since bitcoin is priced mostly in USD, I suspect the dollar rally is also adding some pressure.""      Low expectations for equities come from a number of factors, traders say. Energy consumption, for example, is down, as a glut of oil is causing storage problems with supply far outpacing demand. Oil prices dipped below $20 Monday, a level not seen since 2002.      ‚ÄúIn the short term, we can expect increased inventory and supply while decreased demand will drive the price even lower,‚Äù Nemo Qin, an analyst for multi-asset investment platform eToro, said regarding oil.      As for precious metals, since March 27, gold prices have been in a consolidation pattern, a behavior cryptocurrencies exhibited late last week after hours, once the traditional markets closed.      It appears bitcoin is following traditional markets for the time being, despite advocates‚Äô long-running argument that it is a non-correlated asset that should not move in lockstep with the pack. But traders remain on alert for news of record-breaking stimulus policies around the world that could stoke inflation, which theoretically should make bitcoin, with its predictable supply schedule, more attractive.      See also: Can Bitcoin Survive the Climate Change Revolution?      Japan‚Äôs stimulus plan, for example, has market participants thinking it might result in more crypto volume and subsequent price increases.      ‚ÄúBitcoin rallied last week on inflationary fears in the U.S. It is the first time this year that it behaved as promised,‚Äù said Max Boonen, CEO of B2C2, a London-based over-the-counter (OTC) market maker.",NEUTRAL,BCH,BCH | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/30/bitcoin-follows-stock-markets-higher-how-long-will-they-move-in-lockstep,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1f06d335b4a4ffe8aef717abcfb926d6b1d7d825-1983x1398.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383506,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w92v,1585593804,How Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Slump Is Changing the Geography of Mining,"Although China remains, by far, the leading region for bitcoin mining, the coronavirus downturn is changing the picture in other geographies.      According to Thomas Heller, business director of one of the world‚Äôs largest bitcoin mining operations, F2Pool, market dips have made it unprofitable for some bitcoin (BTC) miners with older machines to operate.      ‚ÄúWe lost 10 percent of our bitcoin hashrate from our clients, for some of our competitors it was closer to 30 percent,‚Äù Heller said, referring predominately to miners across Asia and Europe.      Mining operations in North America have also been impacted. Upstream Data founder Steve Barbour, who operates bitcoin mines on oil fields in Canada, said fewer companies are allocating resources to experiment with bitcoin, at least so far.      ‚ÄúPretty much every Canadian oil producer is basically telling their staff to do nothing and spend no money, and we‚Äôre a service provider for those companies,‚Äù Barbour said. ‚ÄúWe were growing, month by month. This month is flat and I‚Äôm expecting next month to be down.‚Äù      Likewise, the California-based Digital Farms is closing up shop until the price of bitcoin resurges and makes mining more profitable.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      Meanwhile, the coronavirus crisis is hindering the global hardware supply chain.      One anonymous bitcoin miner in Iran said his operations stalled because the sector hasn‚Äôt been able to get new equipment into the country. Leading bitcoin miner manufacturers in China started reporting coronavirus-related delays in late January. Although some global shipments have resumed, other supply chains remain backed up.      Plus, due to the upcoming decrease in mining rewards called the halving, some mining operations are shutting off, at least temporarily until prices make their efforts lucrative again.      Heller estimated Chinese miners still contribute roughly 60 percent of the global hashrate, followed by Russia with 15 to 20 percent and North America with roughly 15 percent. Iran‚Äôs hashrate share is difficult to quantify due to a lack of official statistics.      Russian miners haven‚Äôt been hit as hard by the coronavirus market dip, partially because the Russian ruble was already in dire straits.      The Russian mining operation Bitriver said at least one client moved operations from China to Bitriver‚Äôs Siberian facilities earlier this month. A second Iranian bitcoin miner, whose operations are stalled due to tax conflicts, hypothesized many Iranian mining operations will eventually follow suit and move to Russia if the regulatory climate doesn‚Äôt improve in Iran.      See also: Can Bitcoin Survive the Climate Change Revolution?      Perhaps ironically, the bitcoin mining industry in Iran is dwindling despite domestic demand from retail users. Sources on the ground in Iran, once home to a thriving mining industry, say the Middle Eastern nation is no longer hospitable to crypto entrepreneurs.      An anonymous mining pool manager in Southeast Asia said many Iranian miners are looking to move their operations to Russia or ‚Äúother places with cheap power‚Äù since the Iranian government is now proactively focused on taxing mining operations.      As well-resourced Chinese companies build new setups ahead of the bitcoin halving in May, certain geographies could see an uptick in hashrate share.      ‚ÄúChinese miners are trying to sell large quantities of older S9s [mining machines],‚Äù Heller said. ‚ÄúWith potential buyers particularly in Russia, the Commonwealth of Independent States region [post-Soviet republics in Eurasia] and the Middle East.‚Äù      Anna Baydakova contributed reporting.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/30/how-bitcoins-price-slump-is-changing-the-geography-of-mining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6b86dce30c25b2f66c80a1e435ded020a50dc0e3-1500x1035.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383505,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w91f,1585590824,How Central Banks Could Use Digital Cash to Deliver Universal Basic Income,"Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book ‚ÄúThe Case for People‚Äôs Quantitative Easing‚Äù explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates ‚Äúhelicopter money‚Äù to help economies out of recession.      With the advent of the coronavirus pandemic, Universal Basic Income has suddenly become big news. Many people are now calling for governments to give everyone a regular income with no work requirements ‚Äì since we want most people to stay at home and not work ‚Äì with no means testing (that is, adjusting for income).      However, delivering universal basic income is problematic. Governments lack the up-to-date information on identities and addresses needed for physical delivery of money or pre-paid cards. And checks or bank transfers shut out the unbanked. That leaves a gap for a new institution to step in, like a central bank, which could issue a digital currency as an efficient way of delivering a universal basic income.      See also: 4 Reasons Central Banks Should Launch Retail Digital Currencies      Universal basic income (UBI) is a cash income that is paid to every individual regardless of their circumstances. It is paid:    Regularly (i.e. not one-off ‚Äúhelicopter drops‚Äù)  Directly (i.e. not via an intermediary such as a bank)  To the individual, not the household or family  Unconditionally, i.e. without work requirements or means testing (though it may be taxed away at higher incomes)  Universally, i.e. to everyone irrespective of their age, gender, race, religion, class, income or any other characteristic.    Government already gives regular payments to benefit claimants. Many of these are intermediated through banks, but programs such as Food Stamps bypass banks. However, because Food Stamps have a restricted use, they are often traded by the poor for money, since people can‚Äôt live on basic foodstuffs alone. Also, many benefits, even if paid in cash, tend to go to the household rather than to individuals, creating hardship for, say, women in abusive relationships. In the U.K., where I live, the Conservative government‚Äôs flawed Universal Credit system shows how harsh work requirements can deprive people of the means to live, while pushing people too fast to go without benefits creates a disincentive to work. Welfare systems are, by their nature, both complex and perverse.      See also: How a Flurry of ‚ÄòDigital Dollar‚Äô Proposals Made It to Congress      The present crisis has stretched welfare systems beyond their limit and demonstrated governments can‚Äôt deliver the basic income that everyone needs, and that, I believe, should be everyone‚Äôs by right.      There is an urgent need, and many practical reasons, to provide every individual with a no-questions-asked basic income, delivered in the form of digital cash dollars. But how might it work?    No more government debt    The first thing: Forget about any universal payment that would mean higher government debt. UBI needs to be a right that cannot be taken away. Government debt is ultimately paid from taxes, and people can and do vote to end welfare programs that take too many tax dollars. One of the biggest criticisms of UBI is that it would go to everyone, regardless of means. Higher taxes for people on high incomes would, of course, effectively tax it away, but this is not as ‚Äúvisible‚Äù as withdrawing it. Politically, the ‚ÄúU‚Äù of UBI would soon be dropped if it were funded from tax revenue.    It is best placed to deliver a regular, no-questions-asked monthly payment to everyone, and to manage any ensuing inflation.    So let‚Äôs consider a totally different source of money, the central bank.      There would be two ways for a central bank to deliver UBI. One would be for the central bank to put money into people‚Äôs bank accounts. To ensure this went to as many people as possible, governments would have to force banks to offer basic banking services to everyone. But even so, some people would drop through the net. After all, you can‚Äôt force people to have bank accounts, and some people choose not to.      See also: The US Should Use Stablecoins for Emergency Coronavirus Payments      There‚Äôs another, more radical route. That would be for everyone to have accounts at the central bank. Of course, the central bank isn‚Äôt a retail payment agent, so there would need to be a gateway to payments networks. How might this work?      This is where a CBDC might come in. Imagine that instead of creating a gateway to the existing bank-dominated payments system, which would once again create problems for people who didn‚Äôt want to use banks, the central bank created a digital currency and an associated wallet. The digital currency would be a stablecoin, with a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar guaranteed by the central bank.    Answer: It‚Äôs the central bank‚Äôs job to manage inflation.    Every month, the central bank would put an amount of digital dollars in the wallet. People would access the wallet via their smartphones or other devices. They could transfer the digital dollars to their bank accounts if they wished. Or they could spend them directly because the guaranteed dollar peg would ensure they would be acceptable in payment for goods and services. I would expect a forest of apps to appear, enabling people to use these digital dollars for whatever purpose they want. Alternatively, people could exchange the digital dollars for other cryptocurrencies.      At this point, those who firmly believe money should be scarce will shout, ‚ÄúBut what about inflation?‚Äù Regularly giving money to people, no questions asked, would increase the risk of inflation, they would say. Answer: It‚Äôs the central bank‚Äôs job to manage inflation. The central bank could vary the payments, reducing them if consumer prices started to rise or increasing them if they fell. Alternatively, they could keep interest rates much higher, bearing down on bank lending and reducing the economy‚Äôs reliance on debt. Many people might welcome this.      See also: CoinDesk's ""Most Influential Profile of Andrew Yang      Obviously, the idea central banks could deliver UBI using a CBDC isn‚Äôt going to please those who think central banks shouldn‚Äôt exist and money should be entirely decentralized. But let‚Äôs face it, a fully decentralized UBI is a pipe dream. In many countries, the central bank is independent of government and largely immune from the whims of politicians. It is best placed to deliver a regular, no-questions-asked monthly payment to everyone, and to manage any ensuing inflation. That way, when the next disaster hits we won‚Äôt once again scrabble around trying ‚Äì and failing ‚Äì to get money to people via a patchwork of inadequate benefits, tax systems and primitive payment networks.      It‚Äôs too late to create a CBDC for the current crisis. But as part of the exit strategy we should plan to create a CBDC as soon as possible and create a constitutional right to UBI, so that when the next disaster hits, people know that they will survive.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Frances Coppola,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/30/how-central-banks-could-use-digital-cash-to-deliver-universal-basic-income,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d34d257f03a6aa93d09eadeecef521ade82e2986-1380x863.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383501,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w8u7,1585588203,French Central Bank Puts Out Call for Digital Currency Experiments,"France‚Äôs central bank wants to experiment with integrating digital currencies.      On March 27, the Banque de France published a request for proposals for central bank digital currency ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù applications. These projects will help France‚Äôs central bank understand the risks and mechanisms of CBDCs and also contribute to the eurozone‚Äôs digital cash conversation.      The call brings France to the front of that debate. It‚Äôs the highest-profile eurozone member to launch a CBDC experiment to date (Sweden, whose Riksbank is also toying with digitizing currency, uses the krona).      The Banque de France has advocated for experimental and advanced fintech projects for at least four years, sometimes hinting, through job postings and speeches that it was also eyeing development of a CBDC.      ‚ÄúWe as central banks must and want to take up this call for innovation at a time when private initiatives ‚Äì especially payments between financial players ‚Äì and technologies are accelerating, and public and political demand is increasing,‚Äù Fran√ßois Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Banque de France, said in a Dec. 4 speech on CBDCs.      ‚ÄúOther countries have paved the way; it is now up to us to play our part, both ambitiously and methodically.‚Äù      The three-phase experiment will shepherd selected projects through every aspect of CBDC issuance, from designing a digital currency to analyzing its impact and ultimately executing operations.      France‚Äôs project covers a trio of CBDC use cases: payment against financial instruments; payment against other central banks‚Äô digital currency; and payment against digital assets. There will be no money creation, according to the bank. All exchanges will route across the bank‚Äôs own books with tokens destroyed at the end of each payment day.      Additionally, the project will examine CBDC‚Äôs potential consequences on market infrastructures, monetary policy, macroeconomic factors and legal and regulatory frameworks.      In the call the bank said it is technology neutral, meaning applicants need not necessarily develop a blockchain-based CBDC, ‚Äúbut innovativeness is a selection criterion.‚Äù      Applicants must ‚Äúbe established‚Äù in the European Union. Banque de France will select up to 10 candidates on July 10.      The project as outlined in documents indicates that the Banque de France will not necessarily issue a CBDC at the end of it all.      ‚ÄúIndeed, any decision to create a CBDC is a matter for the Eurosystem,‚Äù the bank said. ‚ÄúConsequently, the Banque de France does not intend to perpetuate or conduct such experiments on a widespread basis.‚Äù      Christine Lagarde, a former minister of the economy for France, is head of the European Central Bank.

Moving things away from password-based centralized architectures allows the real owners of sensitive personal data to control and share it without compromising their privacy.      Germany passed legislation last summer to help digitize pharmacies. Like many complex engineering transformations that would normally take months or years to complete, the coronavirus pandemic is kick-starting solutions for the coming weeks.      Spherity was one of some 40,000 participants that applied to take part in the WirVsVirus virtual hackathon organized by the German government. That number was whittled down to 2,000 actual participants, but the coronavirus-focused event still counts as ‚Äúthe biggest hackathon in Germany‚Äôs history,‚Äù according to German Chancellery Minister Helge Braun.      See also: World Health Organization Teams With IBM, Oracle on Blockchain-Based Coronavirus Data Hub      Stocker said the E-Rezept project was inspired by his mother, who didn‚Äôt want to go to an overcrowded doctor‚Äôs office just to renew a pharmaceutical prescription. A lack of faith in remote identity verification is the reason patients are required to renew prescriptions in person, he said.      The Spherity prototype requires patients to carry their digital fingerprints in wallets that can be accessed by doctors. Once these know-your-customer (KYC) credentials are matched with their records, an electronic prescription can be issued.      ‚ÄúWe are using smartphone wallets, cloud agent infrastructure, in combination with the Ethereum blockchain. But it could also be combined with other SSI solutions such as Hyperledger Indy,‚Äù said Stocker.      The next digital step would be connecting the patient‚Äôs wallet to an online pharmacy. Given the risks of contagion and the need to reduce traffic on critical infrastructure, urgent social distancing is the spur to push forward e-medicine, St√∂cker said.      ‚ÄúThere is an opportunity to do a quick fix using existing decentralized identity technology,‚Äù he said.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/30/german-startup-pitches-decentralized-id-for-prescription-pickup-during-covid-19,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d84d55d1370dd33ee801bfe28567bde502c6443-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383497,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w8rb,1585576807,Binance Cut Leveraged Tokens Because Users 'Don't Read Warning Notices',"The CEO of Binance says the exchange had no choice but to delist FTX leveraged tokens because users didn't understand how to trade them and failed to read the warning notices.      In a tweet thread Saturday, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao said too many users had suffered significant devaluations and the exchange had decided to remove all FTX leveraged tokens in order to safeguard users, just over two months after first listing the tokens.      ""The main reason for delisting is we find many users don't understand them. Even with pop-ups warning users each time, people still don't read it,"" Zhao said. ""Given they are some of the most actively traded token, it is bad for business to delist them. Not an easy choice. But ... Protecting users comes first.""      FTX is a crypto derivatives exchange that operates out of Antigua and Barbuda. It first introduced its leveraged tokens soon after launching in May 2019.      Based on Ethereum's ERC-20 standard, each token tracks an underlying position, either bullish or bearish, in a perpetual contract at 3x leverage. They are designed to be easily tradeable and can be purchased like a token on the spot market. They protect against liquidations by adjusting to price moves automatically.      See also: Binance-Backed FTX Exchange Seeks Billion-Dollar Valuation in Equity Token Sale      Although useful during sustained price trends, they can quickly devalue in some types of high market volatility. ""A common misconception is that leveraged tokens have exposure to volatility, or¬†gamma,"" reads FTX's token description.¬†""Leveraged tokens do well if markets move up a lot and then up a lot more, and poorly if markets move up a lot and then back down a lot, both of which are high volatility.""      Because positions didn't liquidate, some Binance users continued to hold their leveraged tokens even as volatility shot up following the market sell-off earlier this month, which led to sustained devaluations.      ""While these tokens rarely cause you to be liquidated, they will devalue over time as markets fluctuate up and down. They are not meant for long-term holding. If you have an unrealized loss, holding for a come back is unlikely to work,"" Zhao said.      Binance first listed FTX's bitcoin and ether leveraged tokens in January. It came just over a month after the exchange acquired a minority stake in FTX exchange; a strategic move to leverage FTX's expertise in building out its product offering.    In response to the decision, FTX saidhttps://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041612991-Leveraged-Tokens-Updates-2020-3-28 in an update: ""Leveraged Tokens are complicated products, and Binance doesn't want to manage the user education and customer support for them.""    An FTX spokesperson told CoinDesk the company hadn't had any user education issues with leveraged tokens. ""We have plenty of documentation and are always willing to work with users to understand the products."" CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said on Telegram that FTX had added tether (USDT) trading pairs ""so you can deposit/trade [leveraged tokens] on FTX same as on Binance.""

42383511,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w99D,1585573953,"USD Stablecoins Are Surging, but Zero Interest Rates Complicate Business Model","CoinDesk columnist Hasu is a pseudonymous crypto researcher publishing analysis for Deribit Insights and his personal blog.      ‚ÄúThere are decades where nothing happens, and there are weeks when decades happen.‚Äù Vladimir Lenin - allegedly      The last 30 days have been historic by any meaning of the word. The coronavirus is shaking up life as we know it, and has already caused unprecedented dislocations in both the traditional financial markets and the crypto market.      In the center of this financial turmoil was the U.S. dollar, which saw a ‚Äúflight to safety‚Äù from many different assets, including ones deemed ‚Äúsafe‚Äù by traditional investors. As I write this article, the S&P 500 is down 20 percent against the dollar in 2020, crude oil down 62 percent, the British pound down 9 percent, and both the Russian ruble and the Brazilian real are down 25 percent respectively.      While the crypto markets have been insulated from the markets at large for a long time, this is no longer the case now that public blockchains have effectively become rails for the U.S. dollar in the form of dollar-backed stablecoins. Dollars on the blockchain represent the third largest asset in crypto after bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) , ahead of XRP (XRP) and bitcoin cash (BCH). In terms of transactions volume, they are even encroaching on bitcoin itself:      And since they are backed by dollars, they are both affected by global changes in demand for the U.S. currency as well as the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve.      Since bitcoin fell from its $9,000 range all the way below $4,000 before consolidating around $5,000 in mid March, stablecoins as a group have seen net inflows of around $2 billion, a 33 percent increase. This represents the largest surge in demand ever, in line with the dollar‚Äôs demand surge in traditional markets.      Most of these inflows went to tether with +1.55 billion since the start of the year, but USDC and BUSD also gained +170m and +150m respectively.      See also: Policymakers Shouldn‚Äôt Fear Digital Money: So Far It‚Äôs Maintaining the Dollar‚Äôs Status      As demand increases, investors bid up the price of a token beyond one dollar. That creates an incentive for arbitrage firms to step up and introduce more supply into the system until the spread closes. To give an example, a firm could deposit $10 million with tether to buy $10 million USDT tokens ‚Äì for exactly $1 apiece. Then it sells these tokens for slightly more than $1 and pockets the difference as profit.      For the last month, USDT has consistently traded >$1 as a result of this increased demand, explaining the massive 1.55 billion inflows.      Why do investors want USD stablecoins now more than ever? I believe there are three main reasons for this surge in interest.      First, we have seen a flight to safety from risky crypto assets as the markets tumbled. I saw people who are bullish on cryptocurrency in the long-term divest for the short term as previously uncorrelated asset classes started to move down in lockstep.      Second, there is big demand for USD from emerging market currencies that are weakening against the dollar, as described in the intro. Due to its offshore nature, USDT in particular has become one of the best ways to dollarize in places like China, Indonesia, Russia and Brazil.      Finally, the physical reality of coronavirus quarantines and travel restrictions has made moving cash extremely hard for the time being, especially between countries. Dollars on the blockchain have some of the desirable properties of cash, especially in terms of permissionless access and privacy (if used correctly), and can act as a substitute ‚Äì at least temporarily.      While dollar-backed stablecoins increasingly turn into ‚Äúeurodollars lite,‚Äù they are also subject to the monetary policy of the dollar. On March 15, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the federal funds rate by 1 percent to 0 percent-0.25 percent to soften the upcoming recession caused by the coronavirus.      This reduction actually has big effects on the business model of these stablecoin issuers. To understand why, we only need to look at how they make money. So far, there are two main ways.      First, by investing their reserves (usually by lending it to commercial banks, or buying AAA-rated fixed income securities like U.S. government bonds). Going into 2020, the largest stablecoins held a collective $5.5 billion of customer funds. At an interest rate of 1.25 percent, these deposits could have generated up to $68.75 million in revenue for them.    Even with revenue from interest drying up, I see a big future for dollar-backed stablecoins    Because the fed fund rate affects all commercial interest rates, the issuers of coins like tether or USDC now stand to make significantly less money from interest going forward. If the rates become negative, which is the case in Europe and Japan, then they might even have to pay in order to deposit money, turning their business on its head.      Due to the reduction in revenue, there are concerns that stablecoin operators could be pushed into riskier investments to pay the bills, for example corporate bonds. This dynamic could also explain why euro- or yen-backed stablecoins have never taken off.      As a second revenue stream, some operators (like Tether) already charge a fee, currently 0.1 percent, on deposits and redemptions, while others (like USDC) don‚Äôt. We might also see stablecoins explore entirely new business models to meet the new zero-rates reality. USDC seems to push into the direction of becoming a defacto commercial bank by providing APIs for payments (including from fiat credit cards), wallets, marketplaces and business accounts.      See also: Hasu - No, Concentration Among Miners Isn‚Äôt Going to Break Bitcoin      For now, it seems more likely that operators will try to build (and charge) adjacent businesses made possible by these stablecoins instead of passing on costs to retail users, e.g. via inflating the token supply relative to deposits as a form of usage tax, or implementing an additional transaction fee (PAX already does this for its gold-backed token.) The latter brings its own challenges, as users are incentivized to wrap the original tokens in a trustless contract and transact in the receipts instead (similar to WETH/ETH.) Centralized exchanges could once again be the kingmakers in this situation, as they can decide to support the wrapped tokens or not.      Even with revenue from interest drying up, I see a big future for dollar-backed stablecoins, especially now that the opportunity cost for holding stablecoins has effectively gone to zero. We‚Äôll probably see even larger inflows in the future, both from places with negative rates in their traditional bank accounts as well as emerging markets with currencies that rapidly lose their value against the dollar. As long as users value the service offered by stablecoins, I see good odds that operators can develop new and sustainable business models.

That means they can access Unstoppable‚Äôs Ethereum smart contract-registered, InterPlanetary File System-stored (IPFS) websites without leaving the browser address bar.      ‚ÄúIt makes them a lot more useful,‚Äù Unstoppable Domains founder Brad Kam said of the .crypto domains. Previously, web users needed either Unstoppable‚Äôs eponymous browser or a Google Chrome extension to access such sites.      From a technical standpoint, the integration marks an intriguing milestone for Opera, which started browsing .coms, .nets, .orgs and others over 26 years ago. Standard browsers get sites‚Äô IP addresses from Domain Name System (DNS) servers, the internet‚Äôs near-universal equivalent of a phone book. But there‚Äôs no DNS entry for .crypto, according to Unstoppable.      Kam explained that Opera‚Äôs integrated browser uses a fundamentally different process to access .cryptos sites. That‚Äôs because .crypto domains scatter their web content across IPFS‚Äô distributed host network and store the content locators ‚Äì IPFS hashes ‚Äì in Ethereum smart contracts.      ‚ÄúWhen I view a website, the browser is looking up the Ethereum blockchain itself in order to find my website content, instead of looking it up on the DNS servers,‚Äù Kam said in an email to CoinDesk.      He compared decentralized IPFS storage to Amazon Web Services‚Äô global server network, but said IPFS‚Äô reliance on distributed computers instead of a single corporate entity‚Äôs servers make .crypto websites censorship resistant.      ‚ÄúYou have lots of copies, so there‚Äôs no one person or one group to ask to take it down,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEven if one or multiple people decide to take it down, someone else will still have it.‚Äù      Opera said in a press release it partnered with IPFS‚Äô developer Protocol Labs for the integration.      The browser provider said Monday it has also expanded Opera for Android‚Äôs cryptocurrency purchasing feature to the entire European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico and Switzerland.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SPONSORED | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/30/operas-android-web-browser-adds-access-to-crypto-domains-for-80m-users,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c70995db1c139cdcbdbbb9d5e4f862a11afd9d64-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383494,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w8qL,1585572132,Telegram Hopes It Can Still Sell Tokens to Non-US Investors After Court Ruling,"Telegram has asked a court to clarify what exactly it must do to comply with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) order banning the issuance of its gram tokens. The SEC opposed the move.      Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Kevin Castel in New York issued a preliminary injunction in the case, prohibiting the issuance and distribution of the tokens for the messaging app company‚Äôs blockchain TON.      The judge decided the SEC ‚Äúhas shown a substantial likelihood of success in proving‚Äù Telegram‚Äôs private placement of tokens was an unregistered securities sale.      However, Telegram is still waiting for a more detailed order prescribing what exactly it can and cannot do as it prepares to launch its blockchain and investors await their paid-for gram tokens.      In a letter to Judge Castel on Friday, the company‚Äôs lawyer, Alexander Drylewsky, asked the court to clarify if the ban applies to the non-U.S. investors in TON. According to the court documents, about a quarter ($424.5 million) of the $1.7 billion Telegram raised in two rounds in February and March 2018 came from the U.S. investors. The rest, Telegram argues, are not subject to U.S. securities laws.      See also: Telegram Ruling Closes Another Door to Legally Compliant Token Sales      The company said it's willing to take steps to fence off American investors while still fulfilling its obligations for others. ‚ÄúShould the Court require, Defendants will implement safeguards to protect against non-U.S. Private Placement purchasers reselling Grams to U.S. purchasers in the future,"" the letter reads.      Such measures, it adds, could include a condition that non-U.S. investors may can only receive their grams if they are not going to resell them in the U.S., and that Telegram could ‚Äú[configure] the TON digital wallet to preclude U.S.-based addresses.‚Äù      U.S. securities law only covers transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges and domestic transactions in other securities, the company argues, so Telegram still has ‚Äúirrevocable liability‚Äù for its investors in other nations.      Later on Monday, the SEC asked the court to reject Telegram's request, saying it is trying ""to improperly narrow"" the scope of the preliminary injunction, which ""unambiguously, and properly, applies to Telegram's delivery of Grams to 'any person or entity.'""       ""Telegram has sold unrestricted Grams to conduits all over the world, some of whom have already resold their interests ‚Äì consistent with Telegram‚Äôs plan to ensure the widest distribution of Grams ‚Äì including to United States investors,"" the SEC wrote.      Telegram has already notified the court it‚Äôs going to appeal the preliminary injunction. At the same time, the TON Community Foundation, a group uniting some of the TON investors and developers outside of Telegram, announced it has been discussing a launch of TON without Telegram‚Äôs participation.

42383510,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w97x,1585568326,Bitcoin Diverges From Falling Equities With $500 Price Rise,"Bitcoin (BTC) is looking buoyant Monday despite renewed risk aversion in traditional markets.      The top cryptocurrency by market value picked up bids near $5,850 during the Asian trading hours and rose around $500 to $6,344 at 07:14 UTC. At press time, the global average price, as calculated by CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, was at $6,290, up 7 percent on the day.      Bitcoin found takers even though stocks in Asia dipped alongside losses in S&P 500 futures, possibly over renewed fears of a prolonged coronavirus-led lockdown across the globe.      President Donald Trump abruptly abandoned his talk of life returning to normal in some parts of the U.S. by Easter and instead extended social distancing rules through April. That forced markets to price in the possibility of a deeper economic slowdown in the world's largest economy.      See also: US Cash in Circulation Sees Biggest Increase Since the Y2K Bug Panic, Fed Reserve Data Indicates      European equity markets are also trading in the red at press time, with the U.K.'s FTSE 100 and France's CAC index reporting 0.5 percent declines.    Bitcoin decoupling?    Bitcoin putting in a positive performance as stocks suffer may bring cheer to investors and analysts who believe the cryptocurrency is a safe haven asset like gold.      However, it's still too early to say the cryptocurrency has now decoupled from equities. After all, the 90-day¬†correlation¬†between¬†bitcoin's¬†price and the¬†S&P¬†500 rose to 0.52 earlier this month, the highest level on record, according to¬†Arcane Research.      Further, with the virus outbreak showing no signs of slowing down, investors may continue to hold cash (U.S. dollar). Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe the economic fallout in the west has only just begun. Meanwhile, central banks and governments across the globe look to have run out of ammo, having already fired their big ""bazookas"" over the last couple of weeks.      As a result, another liquidity crisis, similar to the one seen a few weeks ago, cannot be ruled out. In that case, bitcoin could again feel the pull of gravity alongside the sell-off in stocks.      Some analysts, however, think bitcoin could soon decouple from the traditional markets as macro traders and institutions have already cashed out their cryptocurrency stashes. ""We think the correlation to traditional markets will ease now that most cross-asset-class investors have sold out,"" Richard Galvin, CEO of Digital Assets Capital Management, tweeted Monday.      Derivatives markets data does show institutions have likely exited the market. Open interest in bitcoin futures listed across the globe has declined by nearly 50 percent from highs above $5 billion seen in mid-February.      Galvin added that the ""highly stimulatory and potentially inflationary central bank and sovereign response"" could only bode well for bitcoin.      Meanwhile, Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Kenetic Capital, said the Federal Reserve's ""All You Can Eat"" quantitative easing plan should prevent future flight from bitcoin as we saw earlier this month.      See also: Investors in Polychain Capital‚Äôs Crypto Hedge Fund Saw 1,332% Gains ‚Äì If They Stomached the Dips      The Fed announced an unlimited asset purchase plan last Monday to contain the economic fallout from the virus outbreak. Meanwhile, the U.S. Congress approved a $2 trillion fiscal stimulus plan on Friday that was promptly signed into law by President Trump.      ""Barring any further cataclysmic shocks to the economy, I expect BTC will rally faster and harder than public markets,"" Chu told CoinDesk.    What do the charts say?    The immediate bias remains bearish despite the price bounce from $5,850 to $6,350, as a rising channel breakdown confirmed on Friday is still valid, as seen below.    4-hour chart    A convincing move above the horizontal resistance line of $6,342 is needed to invalidate the breakdown and open the doors for a re-test of resistance at $7,000.    Weekly chart    Bitcoin failed to close above the former support-turned-resistance of $6,425 last week.      The bull's failure at the key hurdle, coupled with consecutive weekly candles with long upper shadows pointing to ""sell on rise"" mentality, indicates the path of least resistance is to the downside.      Bitcoin would likely slide back toward $5,000 if the buyers fail to defend the Asian session low of $5,850.      The outlook as per the weekly chart would turn bullish if and when prices find acceptance above $7,000.

From March 11 to March 18, dollar banknotes in circulation shot up from around 1.809 trillion to 1.843 trillion, an increase of almost 2 percent, the data shows. The increase was noted Sunday by economist John Paul Koning.      The data is the first strong signal, beyond scattered anecdotes, that U.S. citizens are now withdrawing more cash than usual from banks and ATMs amid concerns over the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.      Also read: While Some Hoard Dollar Bills, Others Envision Germy Cash‚Äôs Quick Demise      The surge is the biggest since late 1999, when fear of a global digital systems crash caused by a rumored glitch in numerical dates ‚Äì the so-called ""Y2K bug"" ‚Äì sparked a frenzy of withdrawals and panic buying.      Based on the weekly change, the week ending Dec. 22, 1999, saw a 3.78 percent rise, while the week ending March 18, 2020, saw an increase of 1.92 percent.      Currency in circulation includes paper currency and coin held both by the public and in the vaults of depository institutions.      The increase comes as the global outbreak of the deadly coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to worsen in many nations, and with the health authorities advising social distancing measures and minimal contact with surfaces that might be contaminated with the virus.

42404308,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhpmV,1585559460,Crypto Lender Celsius Taps Chainlink's Price Oracles for Interest Rate 'Decentralization',"Lending platform Celsius Network has teamed with an oracle provider to make the price feeds it uses to calculate crypto asset interest rates less centralized.      Announced Monday, Celsius has subscribed to Chainlink, which connects smart contracts with real-world data, as a middle pathway to decentralization, said Chainlink CEO Serey Nazarov in a telephone interview with CoinDesk.      Celsius offers above-market interest rate returns for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether, and has some $600 million in assets under management. Under the new arrangement, Chainlink will also place a portion of its bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) crypto holdings under Celsius' treasury management service.      Chainlink launched its live network in June 2019, having raised $32 million in a token sale in 2017. Chainlink provides pricing data for cryptocurrency applications through a series of smart contracts meshing on- and off-chain data into one price feed.      Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications have become a prime applicant for Chainlink in the last few months given the more robust nature of oracles over other pricing data solutions, the firm said. Polkadot became the first non-Ethereum blockchain to integrate Chainlink just a month ago.      Most technical or financial projects often see decentralization as an all or nothing effort, according to Nazarov. Chainlink adds one building block that projects can use to decentralize, in what he described as a ‚Äúhybrid cloud blockchain application.‚Äù      ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre allowing [Celsius] to make data inputs decentralized and what this can do is it can create a certain amount of guarantees we can show on-chain,"" Nazarov said.      Read more: Chainlink‚Äôs Sergey Nazarov on What DeFi Can Learn From Early Exchange Hacks      Describing the service, he explained: ""Here's the data that you were supposed to compute, here's the number you would have computed if your computations were working correctly and then here's the payment output you sent me.‚Äù      Chainlink joins other crypto-first entities such as the Litecoin Foundation in depositing funds for interest accrual. Nazarov said the deposits were ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù portions of the treasury.      ‚ÄúIntegrating Chainlink‚Äôs industry-leading decentralized oracle technology is the key step in the continued decentralization of Celsius [and] helps solidify our mission to bring revolutionary financial services to millions around the world,‚Äù said Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky in a statement.      The partnership follows hectic weeks in the cryptocurrency lending markets which saw millions in collateral called in to solidify outstanding loans.

Yearly returns jumped from a 2.7 percent loss in 2016 to a 2,278.8 percent gain in 2017, according to the document, which accounted for returns up to November of last year. They then nosedived for a 60.4 percent loss in 2018, and surged to a 56.1 percent gain in 2019.      The roller-coaster changes are emblematic of the wild swings familiar to crypto investors small and large. At the same time, the hedge fund‚Äôs performance altogether flies in the face of common wisdom and regular markets. Investors who kept money over the hedge fund‚Äôs lifetime would have netted 1,332.3 percent, according to the document, raising the possibility that a longer outlook may offset incremental risks.      According to the Bloomberg All Hedge Fund Index, non-cryptocurrency hedge funds overall returned losses of 5.9 percent in 2018 and respective gains of 4.0 percent, 9.2 percent and 9.0 percent in 2016, 2017 and 2019. As a benchmark, leading hedge funds not belonging to the cryptocurrency space gain 15 percent to 35 percent over their lifetimes.      Polychain Capital declined to comment. Whether returns are realized depends on when Polychain Capital‚Äôs investors ‚Äì which include distinguished venture capital firms Andreessen-Horowitz, Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital and Union Square Ventures ‚Äì deposit and withdraw their funds.      Polychain Capital‚Äôs hedge fund lock-up period is at least six months, a time horizon that yields wildly conflicting snapshots due to monthly volatility and spells danger for short-term investors who run on lower liquidity.      In a tabulation of 39 months of activity beginning in September 2016, the fund's return curve climbed for one of four months in 2016, 10 of 12 months in 2017, three of 12 months in 2018 and six of 11 months in 2019. The 19 negatively moving months were clustered in the last quarter of every year, and appeared in the first two quarters of 2018 and 2019.      On average, returns rose 7.1 percent on a monthly basis. The best six-month stretch gained 529.5 percent from January to June 2017, compared to 47.6 percent lost in the worst six-month run from July to December 2018, by CoinDesk's calculations.    Token deals    Matt Perona, Polychain Capital‚Äôs COO and CFO, is the former chief financial officer of Criterion Capital, a shuttered equity hedge fund that owned deprecated social media site Bebo. Ex-Tiger Legatus hedge fund COO Joe Eagan is Polychain Capital‚Äôs president.      Olaf Carlson-Wee, Polychain Capital‚Äôs chief investment officer, founded the cryptocurrency investment firm in 2016. The hedge fund is Polychain Capital‚Äôs first fund and invests in parallel with a venture capital arm.      Polychain Capital started raising $200 million for a second venture fund this year. March 2019 filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reported $595.1 million in aggregate Polychain Capital holdings, including $175 million raised for the first venture fund in 2018.      According to an accompanying investor deck, more than 20 cryptocurrency assets average $20 million positions each out of the $550 million in assets the hedge fund says it controlled in the fourth quarter last year.      Half of the crypto assets are liquid coins trading on cryptocurrency exchanges, the deck says, and half are illiquid coins that were sold through digital token sales structured under a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT).      A SAFT is an investment contract that stipulates that a digital token is a security and freezes redemption until the token technology ‚Äì ordinarily a blockchain network or a computing protocol ‚Äì becomes usable.

42404305,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhpjY,1585551600,Microsoft Files Patent Application for Crypto Mining System Powered by Human Activity,"Microsoft has proposed a system that can mine cryptocurrencies using data collected from humans as they exercise or read an advertisement.      In a patent application filed with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Thursday, the American computer giant said sensors could detect activity associated with specific tasks ‚Äì such as time spent viewing ads ‚Äì and convert it into computer-readable data to solve computational problems, in much the same way as a conventional proof-of-work system.      ""Instead of massive computation work required by some conventional cryptocurrency systems, data generated based on the body activity of the user can be a proof-of-work, and therefore, a user can solve the computationally difficult problem unconsciously,"" the patent application reads.      The system could use physical exertion to mine cryptocurrencies: sensors could detect when the body is doing a physical task, such as a faster pulse, and use that data to unlock blocks. Scanners connected to the head could even use brainwaves, signals sent out during mental exertion, to mine for cryptocurrencies.      See also: Microsoft Unveils Platform for Minting Enterprise-Ready Crypto Tokens      Microsoft says the system could be used to incentivize users to perform certain tasks. Scanners can detect activity from certain kinds of tasks, such as mental concentration when reading an advert, that can verify blocks and reward the user with cryptocurrencies.      In late 2017, a Netherlands-based company explored whether humans produced enough energy to mine cryptocurrencies. Their test results found body heat from 37 people, collected over a couple of hours, produced enough energy for a computer to mine continuously for just over eight days.      Although Microsoft designed the system, it is unclear whether the company is moving forward on actually creating it. It is also not clear whether the protocol would run off a fork of an existing protocol, or based on a whole new blockchain entirely.

42404314,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhppS,1585544400,Riot Blockchain Says Coronavirus Outbreak Might Hurt Crypto Mining Farms,"Riot Blockchain is worried COVID-19 may ‚Äúseriously disrupt‚Äù its bitcoin (BTC) mining operations.      The Nasdaq-listed rig builder revealed its concerns in its annual 10-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission, filed Wednesday. Such reports always include a ‚Äúgeneral risks‚Äù section detailing worst-case business scenarios. This year, Riot added two pandemic-specific subsections to discuss COVID-19.      Riot Blockchain is getting thrashed by the response to COVID-19, the general risk section shows. Its workers are being quarantined and going into self-isolation while its supply chain is seizing up under border restrictions and factory closures, according to the filing.      It also has the unwanted label of being a ‚Äúnonessential business.‚Äù According to the 10-K, Riot has not been classified as an essential business in any of ‚Äúthe jurisdictions that have decided that issue to date.‚Äù That potentially cuts off access to Riot‚Äôs offices and mining rigs.      ‚ÄúIf we are unable to effectively service our miners, our ability to mine bitcoin will be adversely affected as miners go offline,‚Äù Riot wrote.      See also: Microsoft Files Patent Application for Crypto Mining System Powered by Human Activity      Riot's concerns echo issues Chinese mining farms faced nearly two months ago. In early February, PandaMiner Chief Operating Officer Abe Yang told CoinDesk his company had difficulty operating some of its farms due to quarantine controls in certain provinces because they had limited staff repairing machines and running the hardware.    At present, Riot's Oklahoma City operation features 4,000 Bitmain S17 Pro Antminers purchased over December 2019 for $6.35 million total, according to two presshttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/riot-blockchain-announces-purchase-additional-214900372.html releaseshttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/riot-blockchain-announces-purchase-3-214500247.html issued at the time. Those rigs replaced Riot's older fleet of about 8,000 S9 models, now offline, the 10-K shows.    The ‚Äúcatastrophic‚Äù business ramifications of COVID-19 are hardly unique to Riot Blockchain; nearly every business is facing an existential threat that only four months ago would have sounded absurd.      It‚Äôs an open question where all this will lead. Riot admits that the pandemic‚Äôs ‚Äúsweeping nature‚Äù makes it next to impossible to predict the long term impact. One thing is certain, though:      ‚ÄúIf not resolved quickly, the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business.‚Äù",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/30/riot-blockchain-says-coronavirus-outbreak-might-hurt-crypto-mining-farms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae5888ecc40d16c25548cb5c995d8a7059064b19-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Established in 2018, Bitget provides crypto trading services for retail and institutional investors. It started out as a spot exchange before pivoting into derivatives last summer, where it now averages around $1 billion a day in trading volume, according to a company spokesperson.      See also: FinCEN: Social Media Companies That Tokenize Must Follow the Law      Registering as an MSB is the first step to Bitget operating as a legitimate exchange, anywhere in the U.S, the spokesperson said. The company still needs state-level licensing to conduct most operations.      According to its MSB registration documents, Bitget's U.S. office is in Denver, Colorado.      Bitget has maintained a low profile in the West, but is ""quite popular in the Chinese market,"" which makes up nearly two-thirds of its 800,000-strong client base, according to the spokesperson. The exchange has now begun offering English-language services.

42404319,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhpxK,1585537200,Bear Market Over? Charts on Bitcoin and ASX 200 Suggest Otherwise,"Some financial publications around the world are touting the ""shortest bear run in history"" for U.S. equities, as if the dark days of the coronavirus sell-off are behind us.      Markets in the U.S. are beginning to show signs of life thanks to the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing plus the recently enacted $2 trillion U.S. stimulus package. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 23 percent and the S&P 500 index has gained around 20 percent from their respective March 23 bottoms. Yet, a conclusion to the wide-reaching COVID-19 pandemic is far from over.      Australia's equity benchmark ASX 200 index is off by 31 percent and Japan's Nikkei 225 has lost 21 percent from their February highs as the COVID-19 outbreak went from bad to worse over a month ago.      Government measures in Australia got a whole lot more stringent overnight. The country's prime minister announced gatherings were to be restricted even further to a maximum of two people in order to slow the spread of COVID-19 from within its borders. The unprecedented measure were agreed to by the newly created ""national cabinet,"" comprised of the premiers of all the states and territories plus the prime minister and convened to coordinate a battle plan against the virus.      So far, the ASX has been slow to react. The index is up by about 2.3 percent on the day. However, pressure toward the downside is apparent. Gains may require significant positive day-on-day returns over the course of this week if they are to signal confidence in the country's latest measures.      Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Kenetic, said that despite the turmoil the ""corona moment"" would be the moment we learned to be truly digital.      ""While all market signs point to a long and lean winter, the silver lining is that remote working and especially socializing is clearly the catalyst to mainstream the digital experience,"" Chu said.      ""From church services to dance parties, group meditation to infant play groups, the digital experience is normalizing for all sectors of society. This experimental phase, driven by a survival instinct, is fundamentally ushering the masses to the ""digital-first"" future,"" Chu added.      In commodities, oil is trading at lows not seen since February 2002. Gold is down half a percent from March 27's close and is showing signs of extreme volatility amid the uncertainty, currently changing hands for around $1,616 per troy ounce.    Bitcoin struggles to gain higher ground    Bitcoin prices' resistance near $6,900 is presenting a significant hurdle for the world's bellwether cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency suffered continual losses last week, with prices down $1,000 from that local peak. Bitcoin is currently changing hands for around $5,900.      Further, two long-term moving averages (MAs), the 200-day and 100-day, are beginning to converge once more. That indicates the potential for a deeper drawdown from Feb. 13's high of around $10,500, reflecting sentiment on current global market conditions.      The last time these two MAs crossed was back in November 2019, when prices fell nearly a quarter to a local bottom of around $6,425 from $8,500.      Elsewhere in crypto, XRP is down 3.6 percent over the weekend. Ether (ETH) is currently trading 4.1 percent lower than March 27's close of around $131.      Global financial sentiment will need to continue to improve significantly in the coming week if there is any real chance of staving off a deeper recession. In the past week, almost all markets have suffered daily lower highs, taken by technical traders to be a negative signal.
