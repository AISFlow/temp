42425965,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhRPh,1407885828,Bitcoin Lender BTCJam Reports No Customer Funds Lost in Hack,"BTCJam has suffered an apparent security breach that affected an unknown number of users.  The peer-to-peer lender was quick to reassure its clients that no bitcoins had been lost from their accounts. A spokesperson said the incident was the result of a hack at its email provider, which allowed the attacker to access funds belonging to customers with low security settings.  BTCJam  started experiencing some issues over the weekend and was offline on Sunday.    We are offline to resolve some technical issues with logging in. We would like to assure you that no Bitcions were lost in this process.      — BTCJam (@btcjam) August 10, 2014      BTCJam reassures users  The latest issue was reported by a BTCJam user on Reddit. The user said the site was down and support had not yet responded to requests for assistance.  Chief product officer Gustavo Guida responded to the thread saying the company was working to get its services back up.  “The majority of our coins are in our cold storage and no users will lose any bitcoins at all,” he added.  Guida said BTCJam is investigating the issue. A few hours later it was up and running again; Guida apologised for the downtime.  The company later posted on its public blog:    ""A recent hack at our email provider Mailjet allowed a hacker to gain access to some of the transactional emails of BTCJam for a period of two hours. Through this, he was able to initiate unauthorized transactions from a small amount of users who did not have Two Factor Authentication enabled.      The problem is now solved and no users have lost any bitcoins as a result of this.""    The article added that as a security measure, the lender would move the most critical transactional emails to its own server and strongly encouraged users to enable two-factor authentication.  Investigating the situation  Shortly after services were restored, Guida said the company managed to identify just “a few” invalid transactions.  “We are finishing our investigations and will reinstate the affected accounts back to the previous state so no bitcoins will be lost at all,” he said.  In the meantime other users reported downtime and suspicious transactions, but for the time being it appears this was a minor issue which did not cause any significant disruptions or losses.  BTCJam is a startup based in San Francisco with the goal to bring peer-to-peer lending to a global audience. Using bitcoin allows BTCJam to approve loans and transfer the funds almost instantly regardless of location. The concept can also be used to provide quick loans to unbanked people in developing regions.

42425980,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhRph,1407879950,Viacoin Team Implements Smart Contract Protocol Built on Altcoin Block Chain,"The first decentralized smart contracts protocol built on top of an altcoin block chain is now live.  ClearingHouse  , a descendent of Counterparty, was created by the team behind viacoin and has been in active development since the alt first launched last month. The team has attracted top talent in the bitcoin space, most notably Bitcoin Core developer and Coinkite advisor Peter Todd who has been hired to work on his Tree Chains concept.  On 11th August, the viacoin development team announcedhttp://blog.viacoin.org/2014/08/11/1-clearinghouse.html new details regarding ClearingHouse’s internal currency, XCH, and information on how users can exchange viacoins for the new currency. Notably, a new Web-based client interface that implements the ClearingHouse protocol, Clearwallet, was also made public.  CoinDesk spoke with viacoin developer BTCDrak, who said that because the ClearingHouse protocol is built on top of the viacoin block chain, certain structural and political complications that have previously plagued decentralized contract platforms are largely sidestepped.  He explained:  “Because ClearingHouse and viacoin are part of the same project, the viacoin block chain will always accommodate ClearingHouse's needs.”  He added that, in the past, the teams behind projects like Counterparty have faced pressure from bitcoin’s development community that ultimately impeded progress. Using viacoin as a basis, ClearingHouse-based projects can avoid these obstacles entirely.  First look at smart contract protocol  Clearwallet is the first implementation of ClearingHouse, giving users a decentralized environment for conducting various contracts. No keys are stored on the server and all transactions happen purely between the two parties.  As shown in the image above, the simple user interface currently offers an asset marketplace, a betting terminal and section for decentralized games. Clearwallet also offers a live chat box, with early adopters already investigating the implementation.  In its original announcement, the viacoin-ClearingHouse development team announced that the exchange rate between VIA and XCH would be 100 XCH per VIA. A 45-day sale period has already begun, with a diminishing exchange rate that will end at 85 XCH for each viacoin.  According to BTCDrak, exchange volume is up and nearly 230,000 viacoins have been converted to XCH, or roughly 143 BTC at press time. Users have already executed several trades in Clearwallet’s VIA/XCH marketplace.  Looking ahead, reputation and identity support will be implemented that add further layers of complexity to how the protocol can be leveraged. As the team noted in the blog post, this includes the creation of decentralized organizations, facilitation of online polls, the sale of goods and services and even the development of new cryptocurrencies.  Decentralized platforms grow in number  The ClearingHouse protocol represents the latest entry in a group of decentralized contract platforms, which also includes Counterparty and the off-block chain decentralized contract network BitHalo. Ripple Labs is also working on its own smart contracts platform, Codius.  Beyond contracts, decentralized platforms are attracting attention for their intrinsic security and appeal to a broad segment of the bitcoin community. It’s this level of grassroots support that has made such projects largely possible.  Among the projects taking shape in this space is BitcoinJ developer Mike Hearn’s decentralized crowdfunding platform Lighthouse. While no date has been given, the platform is expected to launch sometime in the next month.  Commerce has also proved to be a major area for decentralized development. Peer-to-peer marketplace OpenBazaar, created by Brian Hoffman and based on the Toronto Bitcoin Expo Hackathon winner DarkMarket, seeks to bring the principals behind decentralized actions to consumer-to-merchant interaction.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/12/viacoin-team-implements-smart-contract-protocol-built-on-altcoin-block-chain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/155e118252cd93dfa87eb0cb4515631b5a75bc11-1938x905.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425981,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhRrh,1407873614,How Coinalytics is Building the Bloomberg for Bitcoin,"As the tales of nearly every entrepreneur and enthusiast illustrate, it's not hard to become fascinated with bitcoin and digital currency.  Usually, bitcoin believers tell a familiar story about how they discovered cryptocurrency, including the moment of realization that lead them to become entirely engrossed in its untapped potential. Still, while there are those who seek to capitalize by building and innovating in the bitcoin ecosystem, others aim to use their understanding to benefit financially from what remains an emerging market.  For many, bitcoin's price is inseparable from bitcoin the technology. According to CoinDesk’s State of Bitcoin Q2 report, bitcoin's price is a popular subject. For example, four of the top 10 most-read CoinDesk stories in the second quarter of 2014 related to bitcoin's price.  The popularity of stories on price suggests that many bitcoin enthusiasts are seeking to better understand the market as investors. But, in order to do that, they need tools that go beyond the headlines to indicate the underlying health of the market.  A startup called Coinalytics is just one destination that aims to cater to this burgeoning market. As Fabio Federici, founder of Coinalytics, told CoinDesk:  “[Coinalytics] wanted to answer this simple question, basically. Why is the price going up, and why is the price going down?”  Early beginnings  Coinalytics began in Germany, where Federici, a Switzerland native, participated in Startup Weekend, Berlin.  That event encourages participants to try new things. During the early stages of the competition Federici and his two teammates realized that bitcoin was interesting, but the timing wasn’t right for a project aimed at the masses.  Federici recalls:  “Looking the numbers at the time, having a consumer product – there wasn’t enough traction.”  The early Coinalytics idea was to take a number of data sources that were freely available and make them more useful for analysis and application.  The Startup Weekend team built a mock-up and a running prototype within 48 hours that collected data and displayed price. Their approach and final result netted the project an award for ""Most Innovative Idea"" at the competition.  From idea to action  Inspired by his success in Berlin, Federici decided to forgo his MBA studies in Europe to head to Silicon Valley. While attending various bitcoin meetups in the area, he met 500 Startups’ partner Sean Percival.  At the time, Percival had recently announced 500 Startups' next batch would include bitcoin startups, and that he would be mentoring them. Coinalytics was eventually accepted into 500 Startups' Batch 9, which included five bitcoin companies in total.  Federici told CoinDesk that the startup accelerator allowed Coinalytics to build a strong product, saying:  “We started working on the analytics and gathering all the data that’s around. We’ve spent a lot of time on the back end, on the infrastructure to make sure it is easy for us to add new data streams.”  By 500 Startups Demo Day in July, Coinalytics had developed a dashboard as well as infrastructure to let users add new types of data to its platform.  The company is currently using information culled from the block chain, prices from many exchanges and sentiment from social media, among various sources of data.  Coinalytics also brought on two other founders during 500 Startups – Bill Gleim; a former software engineer at Google, and James Edwards; previously a data architect for Amazon Web Services – to peer deeper into bitcoin's data structures.  “The next step is going to be doing deeper analytics on the block chain itself – where we see a big gap right now,” said Federici.  He added that Coinalytics is going to focus on building what the company calls ‘entities’ in order to show connections between addresses on the block chain.  This will show users how bitcoin flows through the system, a different view than that of the block chain. “[It] won’t show every transaction, but [it will] at least show connections, how the bitcoin flows between entities,” said Federici.  Bitcoin's Bloomberg  Still, data collection for bitcoin-related metrics back in November 2013 might have seemed novel at the time. But now, there are now several other startups trying to become the source for bitcoin analytics – and many existing financial services businesses that could be interested as well.  However, Coinalytics thinks its solution will continue to offer a unique perspective into the world’s most popular cryptocurrency.  Federici likes to tell people that Coinalytics is “the Bloomberg for bitcoin”.  Bloomberg has been very successful selling data for financial markets, and the news and information giant could eventually be competition for Coinalytics should it ever get into the digital currency business. In fact, it is already showing bitcoin prices on its well-known Bloomberg terminals.  Federici said he’s not concerned about a possible rivalry, however. Rather, the phrase is just a way to easily explain what Coinalytics does, since bitcoin is still new to many in the financial world.  He added:  “'Bloomberg for bitcoin' is context for investors. A lot of investors are not 100% into bitcoin. And bitcoin is still hard to get. This helps to explain what we are building.”  While Coinalytics has competition from startups like TradeBlock, which recently raised $2.8m from Andreesen Horowitz, Barry Silbert and others, Federici says there is space for many companies to help answer data-based questions about bitcoin.  “There will be ways to figure out a niche,” he said.  The startup plans to reamain in the Bay Area now that its 500 Startups session is over. Coinalytics has found interest, for example, from other bitcoin companies in the region that don’t have the time to collect and analyze bitcoin-related datasets.  Federici said:  “Basically, [the companies] don’t have the data themselves, so they want somebody to focus on that and figure out either patterns in the data or interesting information they can use. “  Coinaltyics hasn’t announced any big companies as customers yet. But, the startup seems confident it can provide insight for traders, venture capitalists and bitcoin entrepreneurs trying to profit and create products within the industry.  Coinalytics is currently in private beta. Early access signup to the platform is available on its website.

42425983,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhRHh,1407866443,First Data: Gyft Deal Will Help Us Evaluate Bitcoin,"Traditional payments giant First Data sent a ripple through the bitcoin community last month when the company announced it had acquired mobile gift card provider and long-time bitcoin industry advocate Gyft as part of a deal with undisclosed terms.  Following the announcement, bitcoin's vibrant Reddit community was quick to speculate what the news could mean for Gyft's long-popular service and what, if anything, the acquisition inferred about First Data’s interest in the bitcoin space.  In a new interview with CoinDesk, senior vice president of First Data Prepaid Solutions Mark Putman has addressed these concerns, confirming that, though the focus of the acquisition was Gyft's mobile gift card platform, the company intends to take advantage of Gyft's position in the bitcoin space to further its knowledge of emerging payment methods.  Putman told CoinDesk:  ""We're going to be watching extremely closely. [...] Getting the company comfortable with bitcoin would be the approach we're taking right now.""  Despite fears expressed by some Gyft users, Putman said that First Data has no plans to alter Gyft's existing service, adding: ""We're focused on making sure that [service] continues to work like it has in the past for Gyft.""  Notably, First Data earns more than $10bn in annual revenue through processing fees, selling and leasing point-of-sale (POS) devices and debit network fees, among other revenue streams.  Observing the industry  Putman went on to suggest that First Data has been watching developments in the bitcoin space, but that this interest doesn't currently extend beyond its broader desire to maintain an understanding of new payment methods.  Still, Putman indicated that the company's interest in Gyft has lead to more internal research on bitcoin, stating:  ""I would definitely say [our bitcoin research] accelerated as a result of the acquisition.""  For now, Putman says, First Data will continue to work with fellow Atlanta-based bitcoin merchant processing provider BitPay to convert bitcoins it receives to US dollars.  Notably, Putman declined to comment on BitPay's business model and what assessment, if any, the company has made about its potential to offer a similar service to the bitcoin space. First Data offers a number of processing services to its clients, with an emphasis on POS devices.  Putman also suggested his company may have some reservations about bitcoin as an emerging payment method, mentioning fraud and regulation as issues that are important to any business decision First Data makes.  Hands-off approach  Vinny Lingham  , co-founder and CEO of Gyft, told CoinDesk that his San Francisco-based company was attracted to the deal because of the synergy he felt between First Data and Gyft's corporate cultures.  Lingham told CoinDesk:  ""It's a great bunch of guys, and we like working with them, and that's what you look for in your partners.""  Putman suggested that First Data, in turn, aims to allow Gyft to continue to build its budding platform, and that its aim is to not interrupt what it already feels is an emerging company in its own right.  Lingham went on to note First Data's successful acquisition of the Andreessen Horowitz-backed POS startup Clover as another influence on the deal.  Expanding its reach  Overall, Lingham voiced optimism that the acquisition will empower Gyft to enroll new merchants, thus continuing to enhance the quality of its mobile gift card offering for general consumers and bitcoin customers.  For example, Lingham said that this validation would help encourage more small businesses and major retailers to join the platform, though he foresees that issues will still arise on an individual basis owing to the nature of his company's core offering.  Lingham concluded:  ""Having a company like First Data behind us saying that this is the future, and pushing us as the de-facto wallet standard for gift card delivery was a big part of why we wanted to get their stamp of approval. It just made a lot of sense.""

42425974,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhRbh,1407861965,Rakuten US Subsidiary Begins Accepting Bitcoin,"Rakuten Super Logistics, an order logistics company owned by Japan-based e-commerce giant Rakuten, has begun accepting bitcoin payments for its shipping services.  The integration comes nearly a month after speculation began that the e-commerce company could soon leverage bitcoin as a payment method. In July, CEO Hiroshi Mikitani said in a speech that he believes Rakuten will adopt bitcoin “sooner or later”.  As reported by Tech In Asia, Rakuten Super Logistics cited consumer demand as the reason for the decision.  Company CEO Joseph DiSorbo said that by adopting bitcoin, the company has opened itself up to previously untapped customer bases, noting:  “We are working to apply this new technology to the benefit of market participants, especially those who can’t now easily access the global e-commerce marketplace.”  Notably, Rakuten Super Logistics chose BitPay as its merchant processing provider. Speaking to CoinDesk, BitPay Executive Chairman Tony Gallippi said that the deal brings bitcoin awareness to a signifcant international market, while also highlighting bitcoin's capabilities for business-to-business (B2B) merchants.  Gallippi told CoinDesk:  'The B2B opportunities for bitcoin are largely untapped today, and companies like Rakuten Super Logistics are at the forefront of B2B bitcoin adoption.""  A retail giant stirs  Rakuten is one of the largest companies to demonstrate an interest in bitcoin to date, reporting $5bn in annual revenue and $31bn in assets as of fiscal year 2013.  According to recent data, Rakuten represents the third biggest company to have at least some elements within its corporate structure to integrate digital currency.  Computing giant Dell, which began accepting bitcoin payments last month, remains the world’s largest company to take bitcoin, reporting roughly $57 billion in revenue last year.  Rakuten, founded in 1997, is comprised of a diverse group of businesses under one corporate umbrella. The company is involved in financial services, travel and media as well as e-commerce.  When Rakuten first publicly acknowledged its interest in bitcoin, founder and CEO Mikitani remarked that the developmental arc of the Internet made digital currency adoption somewhat of an inevitability.  Bitcoin's footprint grows in Japan  Given Rakuten’s outsized role in Japan’s e-commerce ecosystem and the growing prevalence of digital currency enthusiasts throughout the country, the pairing is a significant one.  Coming months after the Japanese government declined to pass new regulations regarding bitcoin, the integration by Rakuten is another sign of bitcoin’s growing prominence in Japan.  Despite being the former home to the now-infamous bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, the domestic market is home to startups like bitFlyer that are raising funds to create new companies in the emerging space.  The number of bitcoin supporters has grown, resulting in grassroots efforts to promote digital currency and its underlying technology. From business community standards groups like the Japan Authority of Digital Asset to meme-themed altcoins, Rakuten’s integration reflects the rising level of the interest in bitcoin among the country’s investors and consumers.

42395310,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaHIq,1407856607,Reviewed: Xapo's Bitcoin Debit Card,"Following months of anticipation, some of Xapo's global customers, including the CoinDesk team, received the company's bitcoin debit card last week.  Though bitcoin debit card offerings have been on the market for some time, Xapo's product is unique in that consumers can make payments and withdraw money straight from their bitcoin wallets, rather than needing to load the card first.  As such, excitement was predictably high for the Xapo Debit Card's release, with many bitcoin users lauding the initial announcement on 24th April. Enthusiasm remained strong, even as Xapo lost support from its original card issuing banks.  Since then, the product has been plagued by delays and messaging issues. For example, the company's late release of a fee schedule for the card prompted outrage from customers, many of whom believed that they should have been more immediately informed of the costs. Xapo later attributed the additional fees to its choice of third-party card issuer, and offered to reimburse consumers for some unintended costs.  Upon debut, CoinDesk finds that the Xapo Debit Card has potential to be a useful bitcoin spending tool, but there are a few hiccups it must overcome first.  Testing it out  When the card arrived, we weren't actually sure what it was. Images of the card on Xapo's site clearly display the company's logo, but the card we received didn't.  Also, the envelope it came in didn't feature the words 'Xapo' or 'bitcoin' anywhere, and neither did the accompanying letter.  The letter referred to ‘My Choice’, which, research revealed, is a Gibraltar-based company specialising in digital payment solutions. My Choice is briefly included in Xapo's website FAQ, but there is no mention of cryptocurrencies on My Choice's website or its parent company, Wavecrest Ltd.  The card itself is a bit flimsy – it's not as thick as a standard credit or debit card, which makes it feel a bit cheap. When selecting the card we wanted, we opted for a GBP version, but we received a USD card, and we weren't alone – Reddit user iwaldo experienced the same issue.  Activating the card is easily done over the phone, and only requires the buyer's date of birth as confirmation.  We headed to a standard ATM and, first, checked the balance of the card. The screen told us the card had a balance of zero, which was a little concerning as we had loaded the card with 0.18 BTC a few days previously. Despite the apparent zero balance, we were able to successfully withdraw £10.  First, we tried buying a coffee from café chain Pret a Manger using the card, but the transaction failed, so we were forced to pay in fiat, which wasn't ideal.  In another shop, we used the self-service tills and the chip and PIN option wouldn't work, so we had to swipe the card instead and sign a receipt, which was only a mild inconvenience. It was third time lucky, though, when we visited a branch of Costa Coffee. Here, we were able to pay with the card via chip and pin, experiencing no issues.  Viewing transactions  The Xapo wallet is easy to use, with a simple layout displaying all recent transactions. One thing that is a bit confusing is that some transaction amounts are displayed in 'bits' and some are displayed in 'BTC'.  How it works  Until now, the only bitcoin debit cards in circulation, such as those offered by Coincard and Cryptex, were slightly less practical. Instead of funds being taken straight from their bitcoin wallets at the time of a transaction, customers had to top-up their card beforehand.  This effectively meant that they had to manually convert their bitcoins to fiat currencies before being able to purchase anything. In Xapo's case, the company does the work – when someone tries to make a purchase or a withdrawal using the card, the transaction is directly forwarded to them.  From there, it is established whether the user has enough bitcoin in their wallet or not, and if they do, Xapo immediately sells the corresponding amount of bitcoin via bitcoin exchange Bitstamp.  The merchant then receives the payment in their local currency. The only thing the customer has to do then is make sure enough bitcoins have been transferred from their Xapo storage vaults to their wallets.  Improvements on the way  According to the Xapo website, the My Choice card design is only temporary, as the current cards are part of an existing program. The next batch of cards will be Xapo-branded, and will clearly show that they are “international bitcoin debit cards”.  It may also become possible to have more than one card linked to a bitcoin wallet, if there is enough demand for it. The company hopes that it will soon be able to send its cards to the US and India, where they are currently not supported, because of an issue apparently linked to My Choice.  In a follow-up email to US and India-based customers signed by chief strategy officer Ted Rogers, the company elaborated on the issues, suggesting that less than 24 hours after the first cards shipped, it was notified it would not be able to extend the offering to those regions.  As a token of appreciation to select US and India-based customers, Xapo said that they would not be charged the $15 fee in connection with the card, and that $25 in BTC would be gifted to their accounts. Only early access users in the US and India who received the debit card or will soon receive the card are eligible for the incentive.  We contacted My Choice's parent company Wavecrest Ltd for comment, but they did not respond before publication.

42425970,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhRXh,1407848430,Bitcoin Foundation Selects BitGo Enterprise as Financial Management Platform,"The Bitcoin Foundation announced today that it will use BitGo's Enterprise product to better manage its financial operations.  Having the Bitcoin Foundation as a customer represents increased momentum and acceptance for the multi-signature wallet provider, chief executive and co-founder Will O’Brien told CoinDesk.  The Foundation conducts the majority of its financial transactions in bitcoin, he explained, including payroll, technical grants and other activities. BitGo will provide them financial and management tools to more effectively scale internal treasury control.  He added:  “I’m excited to partner with them and provide a case study to the world that bitcoin is a very viable currency for businesses.”  Advancing the bitcoin economy  O’Brien said BitGo is proud to count the Bitcoin Foundation as one of its customers as the companies are a “perfect fit”.  He credited the Foundation as an “impactful, influential organization in the community” that has looked after the evolution of bitcoin's protocol and the growth of the core development community.  The co-founder added:  “The number of companies that have been created, the level of venture capital activity and many of exciting new developments on the future horizon –Gavin [Andresen] and the others at the Bitcoin Foundation have instrumental to that success, so we’re excited to support them.”  To him, the new business represents major forces that can help propel bitcoin into widespread institutional adoption. Multi-signature technology is increasingly becoming a standard that all the major platforms and wallets will adopt, he said, because bitcoin needs a framework for security if it’s to continue moving into the mainstream.  Bringing multisig mainstream  BitGo first started looking at multisig technology in early 2013 when it brought the first multi-signature wallet to market.  Introduced earlier this year, BitGo Enterprise takes functionality a step further as a fully HD, multi-user platform. It allows spending limits with approvals, fraud checks, institutional reporting and a number of other security and service protections.  O’Brien believes that bitcoin's future security industry will be best left to specialists. He likened his company to VeriSign in the early stages of transacting money over the Internet, in that the authentication company developed the standard practices and technologies that made e-commerce safer for users.  He said:  “No matter where bitcoin goes, not every company is going to have the wherewithal to work at the very core levels of bitcoin and create all the necessary security policies and procedures. So we’re providing both the multi-signature-based Enterprise services and a platform with an API that can power the next generation of companies and ideas.”  Because bitcoin is so pervasive, O’Brien added, and because digital currency can dramatically and positively impact nearly every industry, there will be an influx of innovation powered by bitcoin.  “Before we know it bitcoin is going to be critical to our lives the way the Internet or mobile communication is critical,” he said. “I think it’s happening from all corners.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/12/bitcoin-foundation-selects-bitgo-enterprise-as-financial-management-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/583d5ec628a30a198ff301ebdbef15e909578bcf-1255x700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Gox creditors now have until 29th May 2015 to file their claims, with the new investigation findings set to be announced four months later on 9th September.  Not much comfort  While the extension gives extra time for news of Mt. Gox's bankruptcy to propagate to creditors in all corners of the world, it is unlikely to impress those who have been following developments from Tokyo closely.  100 creditors from Japan and around the world attended a court hearing with Kobayashi and Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles in July, with most leaving dissatisfied with the lack of answers or details of any investigation into the company's still-missing 650,000 bitcoins. Another hearing is scheduled for late November just before the filing deadline, and no notification has been received yet altering that date.  Even at today's reduced rates, several creditors have reportedly lost six-figure sums too large to recover through regular business earnings or trading. Others have lost their life savings.  Looking for other alternatives  Some in Japan have since taken to internet forums to ask about the possibility of removing Kobayashi from the case, claiming he is not serving creditors' interests by spending big on consultants and administrative costs, while lacking sufficient knowledge of the technical matters involved in a digital currency theft.  Kobayashi did say, however, that he was keen to talk to any parties with an interest in taking Mt. Gox's remaining assets (including 200,000 'found' bitcoins) and using them to start a new business.  Newly-formed company BitOcean Japan is one such group, promising to grant creditors shares in any Gox-derived business. The SaveGox.com campaign, backed by Sunlot Holdings, had also showed interest in reviving the exchange. However, it has not updated its website since May.

42425964,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhRRh,1407836148,LakeBTC Exchange Lets Users Bypass Bank Transfers with Ripple,"Shanghai-based exchange LakeBTC says it has taken a step towards bypassing the delays and costs associated with international transfers by becoming a Ripple gateway.  Previously, users around the world wired fiat money to LakeBTC's account directly. However, they may now deposit funds with a Ripple gateway in their local area in any currency, and transfer it to a LakeBTC USD account via the Ripple network instead. The same applies to withdrawals.  CEO Thomas Xie told CoinDesk the decision to add the Ripple network transfer option was the result of customer demand and a dissatisfaction with the way traditional banks were handling transfers.  He said:  ""The traditional banking/clearance system has been slow (surprise!) to respond to [customers' needs] in the new millennium. They charge hefty fees and the [delays are] not acceptable in the modern world.""  Additionally, a significant proportion of the population don't have access to regular banking services, he added, which has triggered yet another layer of problems.  ""From time to time, our customer support got user complaints about the wire delays, bounced transfers, and outrageous fees charged by the so-called 'intermediary banks' or 'correspondent banks'.""  However, the addition of Ripple means that funds can now be moved in and out of LakeBTC accounts instantaneously and at minimal cost, no matter where users live.  Other options  LakeBTC had been evaluating a number of other alternative methods for users to streamline the deposit and withdrawal process, Xie continued, before deciding on Ripple.  Users can also access LakeBTC accounts via EgoPay, and the company is still planning to add more banking and payment processor options in future.  Xie added:  ""Our goal is to build a bitcoin platform with security, liquidity, and extraordinary service.""  Ripple: sending and receiving funds  A Ripple gateway functions in a similar way to a traditional bank branch. Just as banks take your cash and move it into and out of the international banking system, so do Ripple gateways with the Ripple network.  A basic demonstration of how gateways function is below:  To use a Ripple gateway, a user first needs a Ripple Wallet, which comes with an address and account, and can be set up easily onlinehttps://ripple.com/client/.  Each account requires a minimum balance of 20-30 XRP (about $0.17). XRP is the currency of the Ripple network and is often compared to postage stamps on an envelope.  You can add funds to your Ripple account by setting up a 'trust line' with a local Ripple gateway, which are the entry and exit points for assets into the Ripple network.  Funds can be sent to the gateway using local bank transfer, PayPal, Credit Cards, or any other payment system they accept.  The gateway then issues you an 'IOU' for that amount, and you're free to send it anywhere in world within the Ripple network at almost no cost: this now includes LakeBTC accounts.  When you want to withdraw the funds, use your wallet to notify the gateway, and the gateway must deliver those real-world amounts to you.  This is also why it's important to use gateways you trust. IRBA certification is just one option, and it's wise to do your own online research as well.  LakeBTC, one of the world's largest exchanges  LakeBTC is one of the world's top five USD-BTC exchanges by volume, and was added to the CoinDesk BPI for both USD and CNY in June.  Started in March 2013, it was initially run as a bitcoin exchange for a small group of financial professionals before opening to the general public later that year.  Xie said LakeBTC is marketed towards all participants in the bitcoin ecosystem, including traders and institutions, miners, merchants and individual investors. Risk management and internal controls made LakeBTC stand out from the crowd, he added.  ""For financial firms, technology is only [the] tip of the iceberg to safeguard inventors' funds and personal information. The real challenge is on the financial turf: any weak link in risk management or process control will allure predators to sink the entire ship at the cost of all users.""  High availability with fast trade matches were key to LakeBTC's liquidity, Xie said. The platform also provided market data and trading APIs for advanced users looking for arbitrage, market-making and algorithmic trading.  The exchange recently added 'Dark Pools' feature allows orders of 50 BTC or over to be 'invisible' to other users, preventing them from causing large price fluctuations and avoiding the attention of 'financial predators' who watch for potentially large price movements.  LakeBTC is currently owned by Lake Investments Limited, with Shanghai Trading IT, Inc. providing the service's technical and customer support.
