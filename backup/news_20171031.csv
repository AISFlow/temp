42400594,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK6kf,1509485403,London Stock Exchange Exec: Fiat Cash Impeding Blockchain Trials,"Fiat currencies are hampering blockchain innovation – at least according to David Harris, head of commercial innovation at the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG).  In a keynote address at the third annual London Blockchain Summit today, Harris told a crowd of about 150 global bankers, insurers and technology providers that he looks forward to a day when central banks will issue their own cryptocurrency.  While not a new aspiration, the reason Harris gives for wanting to move to a cryptocurrency equivalent notably stems from LSEG's role on the Borsa Italiana project, which looks to issue securities on a blockchain. But even with tests underway, in which multiple unlisted companies have been given access to services normally reserved for public firms, LSEG continues to encounter obstacles related to paying for securities with cash.  ""Eventually, and hopefully, central banks will issue their currency in a digital form on a blockchain, because then that will facilitate collateral movement,"" Harris said.  The statements underscore that while some central banks have deemed cryptocurrencies a threat and moved to ban them, others are in fact exploring the potential benefits of issuing fiat currency on a blockchain.  But, Harris is conscious that there are factors that could impede a swift embrace.  As blockchain technology was in large part developed to make banks and other middlemen unnecessary, once a central bank decides to issue a cryptocurrency, that could call into question the entire concept of commercial banking, Harris said.  As Harris puts it, ""nothing is easy.""  He concluded:  ""You're not going to wake up one day and suddenly have a crypto-dollar facilitating collateral movements. The policy decisions you have to make from here to there are huge.""

42400581,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK6ap,1509478200,SEC Alleges Day Trader Used Bitcoin to Hide Fraud Profits,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is suing a Philadelphia day trader for alleged fraud, claiming they used bitcoin to hide their profits.  On Oct. 30, the SEC filed suit against Joseph Willner, accusing him of illegally taking over more than 100 brokerage accounts and using the victims' funds to artificially inflate stock prices that he would then trade against advantageously.  In order to hide the profits of those activities, the SEC said, Willner used an unnamed bitcoin exchange to convert the funds from U.S. dollars to bitcoin. Those proceeds were then transferred to another individual, who was not named in the lawsuit.  The agency said in a release:  ""To mask his payments to the other individual as part of a profit-sharing arrangement, Willner allegedly transferred proceeds of profitable trades to a digital currency company that converts U.S. dollars to Bitcoin and then transmitted the bitcoins as payment.""  According to the complaint, the two made at least $700,000 in profits through the alleged account take-over scheme. The SEC added that its investigation is still ongoing.  The case was investigated through the SEC's Cyber Unit, which was unveiled in September and is aimed in part at crimes involving cryptocurrencies.  ""Account takeovers are an increasingly significant threat to retail investors, and it is exactly the type of fraud our new Cyber Unit is focusing on,"" Stephanie Avakian, Co-Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, said in a statement.

42400591,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK6le,1509472835,"Survey: Younger Americans More Interested in Cryptocurrencies, ICOs","Younger Americans appear to be more interested in cryptocurrencies compared to other age groups.  That's according to the latest survey published by digital student loan servicer LendEDU, which asked roughly 1,000 U.S. citizens about ether and Ripple's XRP token at the end of October. The questions ranged from whether people had heard of ether and XRP to if they would invest in the cryptocurrencies.  According to the survey, 31.6 percent of respondents have heard of ethereum (with 18.2 percent planning to invest in it) while 22.2 percent have heard of XRP (with 14.8 percent intending to purchase some).  After breaking the results down by age, the data shows that roughly a third of respondents between the ages of 18 and 44 planned to invest in ether, while another third did not. The final third was uncertain.  A far smaller portion of adults aged 45 and up planned to invest in ethereum, with between 89–98 percent of respondents saying they were either not going to invest or were unsure.  The results of the research closely match LendEDU's previous survey, which instead took a focus on bitcoin. In that survey, the majority of respondents who had heard of bitcoin were also in the younger age ranges, while older respondents indicated less awareness of the cryptocurrency.  The latest survey also looked at initial coin offerings (ICOs), finding that roughly a quarter of respondents had heard of the blockchain funding model, while 75.1 percent had not. However, there was some uncertainty around the status of ICOs among even those who had heard of them.  LendEDU said of the results:  ""In our September survey, we found that 10.69 percent of Americans believed that owning bitcoin was illegal in the United States. In our October survey, we found that 21.00 percent of respondents believe that investing in an initial coin offering is illegal. And, 61.10 percent of respondents were unsure about the legality of investing in an initial coin offering.""  On the other hand, 15.1 percent of respondents said they plan to invest in an ICO in the future.

15990323,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/stash-wallet-makes-bitcoin-user-friendly-retaining-core-value-proposition,1509471372,Stash Wallet Makes Bitcoin User Friendly While Retaining Its Core Value Proposition,"Late last week, Stash made their bitcoin wallet available for download on the Google Play Store. This is a wallet that is many years in the making, with its roots based in the Open Transactions project, which has been discussed as an extension to Bitcoin since 2010. Stash Wallet has support for both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, in addition to the testnets for the two cryptocurrencies. During a presentation at the recent Texas Bitcoin Conference, Stash CTO and co-founder Chris Odom indicated other cryptocurrencies will eventually be added to the wallet. The goal of Stash is to offer financial autonomy to those who desire it in a user friendly manner. The company’s first product was the Stash Node Pro, which is a Bitcoin full node combined with an Open Transactions server that can run in one’s home. With the Stash Wallet, users can connect directly to their Stash Node Pro from their mobile phone to bring that financial autonomy with them on the go. “Making software devices ‘just work’ in crypto is more critical than in a typical software application,” said Odom at the Texas Bitcoin Conference. A More User Friendly Payment Experience So how does Stash intend to bring a more user-friendly experience to Bitcoin without giving up on the technology’s core principle of financial autonomy? One way is through the use of reusable payment codes. These payment codes can be used as static identities for users, which then create new addresses for each Bitcoin payment. While the payment code can be made public, outside observers will not know which Bitcoin addresses are attached to that payment code. Reusuable payment codes come with two key benefits: privacy and convenience. Users can essentially store an address book of payment codes, which means a payment can be received from “Bob” or “Alice” rather than a long string of random numbers and letters. In this way, the platform will look more like a traditional payments app where users can see real names attached to their payments history. Additionally, payments can be sent back and forth once payment codes are shared, which means Bob doesn’t have to ask Alice for a new Bitcoin address every time he wants to make a payment (and visa versa). During his presentation at the Texas Bitcoin Conference, Odom noted that the same payment code can be used across chains and even for Bitmessage. The current version of Stash Wallet also includes an encrypted messaging component, which works through Open Transactions. Decentralizing Traditional Bitcoin Services with Open Transactions The most anticipated aspect of the Stash project is likely the Open Transactions component. Through the system of federated servers, cryptocurrencies can become more useful while also avoiding the pitfalls of today’s cryptocurrency exchanges and banks (namely loss of funds through hacking, incompetence, or theft). Open Transactions allows anyone to launch their own server, which can be used to create any kind of financial instrument. For example, a user could issue traditional forms of digital cash provably backed by bitcoin. This digital cash can then be used in a variety of smart contracts and other financial applications. The federated model of Open Transactions means that there’s no central point of failure for the ecash server, but trust is still required in terms of the bitcoin backing the digital cash tokens. This is where voting pools come into play. Voting pools allow multiple, competing entities to pool their bitcoin together in a single multisignature wallet and issue financial instruments based on that pool of funds. When multiple parties are pooled together in this manner, the threat of lost funds is potentially lowered because multiple parties would need to be hacked, corrupt, or incompetent for something to go wrong. One way to think about it is that a user is effectively storing their money in a pot where Bitstamp, Coinbase, Kraken, and a couple of other exchanges would have to get hacked rather than just one of them. Much More to Come The current version of the Stash Wallet was described as a minimum viable product during a recent appearance on The Crypto Show with Daniel Krawisz and Justus Ranvier, who are also members of the Stash team. Having said that, there are many other features on the horizon. Shufflepuff (a version of CoinJoin), which was originally developed by Krawisz for Mycelium, is said to be the mixing option of choice that will eventually be implemented into the Stash Wallet. While Odom is a fan of the OpenBazaar project, Open Transactions contains its own bazaar application that will be made available in the Stash Wallet. Other than that, there are indications that various features that have become popular with Ethereum, such as issuing colored coins and creating decentralized autonomous organizations, will also come to the Stash Wallet by way of Open Transactions.",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | ETH | EXCHANGE | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/stash-wallet-makes-bitcoin-user-friendly-retaining-core-value-proposition,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/15990323.jpeg

Users can essentially store an address book of payment codes, which means a payment can be received from “Bob” or “Alice” rather than a long string of random numbers and letters. In this way, the platform will look more like a traditional payments app where users can see real names attached to their payments history. Additionally, payments can be sent back and forth once payment codes are shared, which means Bob doesn’t have to ask Alice for a new Bitcoin address every time he wants to make a payment (and visa versa). During his presentation at the Texas Bitcoin Conference, Odom noted that the same payment code can be used across chains and even for Bitmessage. The current version of Stash Wallet also includes an encrypted messaging component, which works through Open Transactions. Decentralizing Traditional Bitcoin Services with Open Transactions The most anticipated aspect of the Stash project is likely the Open Transactions component. Through the system of federated servers, cryptocurrencies can become more useful while also avoiding the pitfalls of today’s cryptocurrency exchanges and banks (namely loss of funds through hacking, incompetence, or theft). Open Transactions allows anyone to launch their own server, which can be used to create any kind of financial instrument. For example, a user could issue traditional forms of digital cash provably backed by bitcoin. This digital cash can then be used in a variety of smart contracts and other financial applications. The federated model of Open Transactions means that there’s no central point of failure for the ecash server, but trust is still required in terms of the bitcoin backing the digital cash tokens. This is where voting pools come into play. Voting pools allow multiple, competing entities to pool their bitcoin together in a single multisignature wallet and issue financial instruments based on that pool of funds. When multiple parties are pooled together in this manner, the threat of lost funds is potentially lowered because multiple parties would need to be hacked, corrupt, or incompetent for something to go wrong. One way to think about it is that a user is effectively storing their money in a pot where Bitstamp, Coinbase, Kraken, and a couple of other exchanges would have to get hacked rather than just one of them. Much More to Come The current version of the Stash Wallet was described as a minimum viable product during a recent appearance on The Crypto Show with Daniel Krawisz and Justus Ranvier, who are also members of the Stash team. Having said that, there are many other features on the horizon. Shufflepuff (a version of CoinJoin), which was originally developed by Krawisz for Mycelium, is said to be the mixing option of choice that will eventually be implemented into the Stash Wallet. While Odom is a fan of the OpenBazaar project, Open Transactions contains its own bazaar application that will be made available in the Stash Wallet. Other than that, there are indications that various features that have become popular with Ethereum, such as issuing colored coins and creating decentralized autonomous organizations, will also come to the Stash Wallet by way of Open Transactions.",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | ETH | EXCHANGE | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Crypto Daily,http://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/stash-wallet-makes-bitcoin-user-friendly-retaining-core-value-proposition,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/15989359.jpeg

Philipp Pieper, a partner at the company, told CoinDesk that 637 contributors took part in the token sale, which was split into two phases. All told, those backing the project gave 18,048 ethers in exchange for 8,171,014 SWM tokens, with almost all of the funding being raised during the pre-sale.  Owners of Swarm Fund tokens can vote now on the way in which their tokens will become liquid on the open market, reflecting a pivot the company made two years ago, to focus on decentralized governance.  Swarm Fund seeks to enable people to buy into investments that they might not be able to otherwise access. In order to make decisions about investments, Swarm designed a voting system that uses the SWM tokens to determine the outcome.  The first test of its voting system is underway now, according to the firm. Token holders have four options to choose from, ranging from large, infrequent distributions to smaller, more frequent ones, according to a blog post describing the vote.  ""This is kind of a big deal,"" Pieper wrote CoinDesk, ""as this directly influences the behavior of the token and it draws in buyers to become 'active investors' right away.""  Voting will run through Nov. 6, with token holders ballots being proportional to their overall holdings.  Of the funds gathered, 25 percent of funds raised will be used to support the foundation that will manage the token, with the remainder going toward software development. According to its whitepaper, Swarm's goal had been to raise $55 million.  The completed sale represents the latest utilization of the blockchain use case this year. CoinDesk's ICO Tracker shows that more than $2.6 billion has been raised through token offerings to date.

This means that it is requiring more energy and is, therefore, becoming less lucrative for miners. One way that miners are trying to maintain their profitability is by decreasing their energy costs. The added benefit of this is that it reduces the environmental cost as well. Mining a single Bitcoin now consumes 20 barrels of oil. This is an astonishingly high amount, although, with the current value of Bitcoin standing at over $6,000, this equates to the value of around 100 barrels of oil.

42400600,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK6pa,1509465637,Vertcoin Clocks Record High Ahead of Reward Reduction,"Bitcoin isn't the only cryptocurrency trading at all-time highs today.  At press time, the vertcoin-U.S. dollar (VTC/USD) exchange rate is $5.55, its highest level ever. Week-on-week, VTC has witnessed a 69 percent appreciation in value, while on a monthly basis, its price has gone up by an astonishing 431 percent.  So, what's behind the rally? The boost for the lesser-known crypto appears to be occurring as it closes in on a reduction of its block reward, expected on Dec. 12.  The term ""block reward"" refers to the amount of the cryptocurrency received by miners for creating a block. As a result of a coded halving mechanism, production of new coins will drop from the current level of 50 VTC to 25 VTC in a matter of weeks.  With this drop in supply on the cards, simple economics suggests that value of existing vertcoins might be likely to rise. Traders would seem to agree, as volumes have climbed 79.22 percent in the last 24 hours, most notably on the Bittrex and Poloniex exchanges.  Another reason for the rally could be increased attention on the coin following the introduction of cross-chain atomic swaps, which allow direct trades between its blockchain and other compatible networks.  On Sep. 20, Litecoin creator Charlie Lee tweeted the news of a successful swap between the litecoin (LTC) and vertcoin blockchains using the technique, making it one of the first to support the innovation. Looking back, VTC began its record rally in late September, indicating the positive impact of the technology may have been priced-in.  However, at press time, the rally looks to be stalling and the price action analysis indicates the potential for a healthy correction.  4-hour chart  If the current candle closes in the red, a bearish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence would be confirmed. A bearish divergence occurs when the price forms higher highs and the RSI forms lower highs. It indicates a weakness in the trend.  View  VTC could see a healthy pullback to $4.00 if the bearish RSI divergence is confirmed.  The RSI is overbought on the daily chart as well, hence a short-term consolidation in the range of $4.00 to $6.00 is more likely.

According to an Oct. 30 statement, the State Bank of Vietnam said that cryptocurrencies are not a ""lawful means of payment"" in the country, and the ""issuance, supply, use of bitcoin and other similar virtual currency as a means of payment is prohibited.""  From next year, it goes on, illegal use of cryptocurrencies in payments will be subject to penalties of between 150 million ($6,600) and 200 million ($8,800) Vietnamese dong (VND).  The central bank states:  ""As from January 1, 2018, the act of issuing, providing and using illegal means of payment (including bitcoin and other similar virtual currency) may be subject to prosecution.""  The moves comes as part of a new legal framework for cryptocurrencies instigated by Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc. That process has now been completed and the framework submitted to the government, the State Bank indicates.  Local reports suggest that the ban may already be having an impact on local institutions.  News source VietnamPlus said that FTP University in Hanoi, which recently announced it would allow students to pay for tuition in bitcoin, could now be forced to reverse that decision. Representatives of the State Bank reportedly stated that, if the university continued to treat bitcoin as a ""legal means of payment,"" it would be ""committing an act of violation under the current law provisions, and may subject the university to the appropriate sanction.""  The move by the central bank is likely to come as a shock to many in the domestic cryptocurrency space. When the prime minister requested the framework to be drawn up in August, there were hopes the country might formally recognize bitcoin as a form of payment next year.  However, the country has previously issued warnings about bitcoin and blocked credit institutions from offering digital currency services.

42428020,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5Fhh,1509456612,Last Laugh? Dilbert Creator Scott Adams Talks Plans for Token Launch,"When Scott Adams announced his company would embark on an initial coin offering (ICO) on his blog Friday, he wrote without sarcasm that the day might be one of the ""biggest"" of his life.  Quite the statement from the creator of the beloved Dilbert comic strip, readers may be surprised given Adams' recent, pointed take on blockchain mania. But far from just lampooning the technology, Adams is gearing up to get firsthand experience of how it can be used for fundraising.  WhenHub – a time visualization firm co-founded by Adams – is now preparing to launch a token of its own, preceded by an offering of Simple Agreements for Future Tokens, or SAFTs.  The project, according to Adams, allows subject matter experts to sell small amounts of time to clients, who will consult in a Skype-like video call session over the platform, the WhenHub Interface Network (WIN). The new product will facilitate auctions and payments, a system that would be built on top of ethereum using smart contracts, taking the tedium out of payments and invoicing.  In interview, Adams explained that he went through much the same process as everyone else: going from asking ""What the hell is this?"" to having days where he kind of started to get it and others where he could see the bigger picture.  Adams told CoinDesk:  ""Once you see different applications for the blockchain, you start to see: This is way more than I ever imagined.""  Adams went on to explain his recent strips about blockchain aren't intended to inspire others to write off blockchain tech.  Rather, he said, they have been inspired by how difficult it can be to explain the technology. In this way, he reasons the comics reflect the way it feels when someone understands something very new and they have to talk to someone else who doesn't.  ""This is based on a real technology that I think you can say is tried and true,"" Adams said. ""It's not like a management fad ... It's more like the internet in the early days.""  Bitcoin, in particular, has impressed Adams because ""the secret inventor merged technology and persuasion,"" he said. His recent writing has focused heavily on the latter topic, including a new book, ""Win Bigly,"" on how Donald Trump convinced voters to elect him president.  Later on, Adams would use similar wording when discussing how bitcoin took advantage of the psychology of scarcity, hipness and greed to convince people to adopt it and treat it like it like gold.  ""It's one of the greatest pieces of persuasion the world's ever seen,"" Adams said.  Getting to WIN  WhenHub's CTO arrived at blockchain after creating previous products that helped people conceptualize and manage time, such as calendar management, timeline visualization and meeting coordination.  Adams said:  ""As the world often goes, you start with one good idea and then you discover others that might be more fun and more profitable to chase.""  The company held a hackathon early in the year in which one of the entrants included a blockchain element in his not-quite-completed project. It came to mind for another WhenHub co-founder, CTO Nik Kalyani, when he was speaking to a consultant friend about the struggle to find that next client after completing a project.  WIN will now allow skilled people to squeeze revenue from gaps in their schedule, while enabling consumers to get knowledgeable answers to very specific questions. Adams said he could have used WIN recently when he spent six months trying to set up a live-streaming studio in his home that could work on all the platforms, such as Facebook and Periscope.  ""There are just some things you can't Google,"" he said.  An hour with someone who has set up a lot of such systems, he continued, would have saved him a lot of time and headache.  Adams, too, says he gets lots of requests for his time, but finds it difficult to manage all the requests. When he does sit down with people, ""most times they have 15 minutes-worth of questions,"" he said.  So experts on WIN can post increments of time as small as 15 minutes on their calendar, setting a minimum price for a consultation. Clients interested in talking to them can then bid for the time slot, and the winning bid is permitted to connect with the expert.  After WhenHub verifies the session took place, client funds are released to the expert via a smart contract.  The WHEN token  Equally important to the network will be its custom cryptocurrency.  An ERC-20 token built on top of ethereum, WHEN will manage payments between experts and clients on the WIN platform. By creating its own token, the company is able to seed early adopters with rewards for participation for useful activity without the need to spend fiat money to buy ether to provide those incentives.  ""This is a case where the token is marketing as well as technology,"" Adams said. ""The two worlds collide.""  Early experts on the platform will be rewarded with tokens for doing things like completing their profile, linking it with social media (such as LinkedIn) and getting their identity verified with WhenHub partners. Provided they do a good job and manage to attract clients, those seed rewards will start to take on real value.  The company has devoted 26 percent of the total pool to drawing influencers onto the network.  Adams expects the earliest adopters to be people with technological skills, though he also expected that counselors of various kinds might use the service as well.  ""I would be amazed if sex workers don't find this, because they find everything,"" he added.  Larger strategy?  Going forward, WhenHub aims to sell enough tokens to fund the company's operations for two-and-a-half years, which Kalyani estimated will require about $35 million.  Of the total 875 million tokens, 350 million will be offered via a SAFT, according to its white paper. The pre-sale is open now, with a minimum investment of $50,000, and a token bonus of 30 percent.  A public sale will open on Nov. 10 and run through the end of the year, with a minimum purchase of $250. Early buyers in the public sale will get a token bonus as well.  Still, for those sitting on the sidelines, Kalyani was keen to note that the team believes WHEN tokens could also end up finding a place in other products, hinting at a larger strategy in mind that he believes might continue to make it compelling.  Kalyani concluded:  ""We've always had this vision to solve problems with time.""

42428029,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5Fzh,1509453048,Bitcoin Cash Rally Stalls as Traders Price in Possible Fork,"Bitcoin cash is trending down amid news of an upcoming technical change.  After rallying more than 30 percent over the last week, with prices clocking a five-week high of $522.95 on Sunday, the bitcoin cash-US dollar (BCH/USD) exchange rate is $438 at press time, up slightly from a low of $415 yesterday.  However, the move isn't without cause, as an attempt to update the project's underlying software appears to have traders slightly spooked.  Bitcoin cash developers explained yesterday that they intend to push forward a fix for the code meant to make its mining network more sustainable as soon as Nov. 1. But while those behind the effort sought to position it as sufficiently tested, noting it won't come into effect until Nov. 13, the market reaction was more mixed.  Remarks on social media indicate users may be worried about a lack of coordination between the developers and how the blockchain, which feature's bitcoin's original code plus a boost to the block size, might compete with Segwit2x, another fork that could launch in mid-November.  Despite the apparent fork concerns, though, price action analysis suggests the market favors the bulls as long as the effects of the hard fork are not too severe.  Technical Chart  The chart above shows:  Breach of the falling trend line last week, followed by a solid rally to a 5-week high of $522.95  Inside day candle pattern: Monday's price action (high/low) falls within the price range of the previous day  Currently, prices are trading at the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the decline from Aug. 19 high to Oct. 19 low.  An ""inside day candlestick' is a neutral pattern, pointing to the price action on the following day, which decides the trend.  View  A close below $415 (previous day's low) would signal bearish inside day candle reversal and shall open doors for a re-test of the trend line support seen around $325 levels.  On the other hand, a move above $415 would revive the bullish move and could yield rally to $544 (38.2% Fibonacci retracement).  The bias remains bullish, courtesy of strong upside break of the falling trend line and jump in trading volumes.  Volume Analysis  As per CoinMarketCap, trading volumes for BCH have jumped 750 percent in the four days since Oct. 29, which might validate the upside break of the falling trend line witnessed on Oct. 27.  Meanwhile, volumes dropped 60 percent on Oct. 30, which means the retreat in prices from $522.95 to $415 lacked substance (drop due to profit taking).  To conclude, volume activity favors further upside in bitcoin cash.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which acted as organizer for the SegWit2x proposal.

42428026,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5Fth,1509451204,Not a Consortium: Banks Form For-Profit Entity for Blockchain Supply Chain,"A group of eight major banks is close to forming a new kind of blockchain venture.  In contrast to the consortium models common to the sector, We.Trade recently revealed plans to move much of the European supply chain trade finance to a Hyperledger blockchain. Yet, it's how the group is taking its technology to market that sets it apart: hardly another non-profit, the founders (which include KBC, Deutsche Bank and HSBC) have a direct equity stake in the project's success.  With a tiered membership built to serve a single, valuable use case, and licensing members to use it, those involved believe they have created a structure that, while unique, is essential to the endeavor.  As put forward by Roberto Mancone, global head of disruptive technologies at Deutsche Bank, the innovation emerged from the founder's demand for useful technology in a short time-frame.  Mancone told CoinDesk:  ""[The joint venture] is the legal entity necessary in order to license the platform to other banks. Otherwise, as a consortium, you couldn't do it.""  And this isn't the only step that's being taken to get the effort off the ground quickly.  After initial plans to launch in London were thwarted by the U.K.'s impending exit from the European Union, the joint venture is being established in Dublin, Ireland.  Still, questions are emerging about how the group makes money.  In addition to becoming licensing members, the founders (also including Natixis, Rabobank, Societe Generale, UniCredit and most recently, Santander) will receive an equity stake in the company.  And it's this last point that might be most pertinent as the platform moves toward launch.  Devil in the details  As shown by conversation at Sibos earlier this month, convincing other partners that all members will be treated equally, even without equity upside, could take some time.  At the conference, audience members expressed concerns during a question-and-answer session, as well as in conversation with CoinDesk, over the design, and what they hinted might be an inequality between the two member classes. The argument follows that, since blockchain networks tend to grow in value relative to their size, founders stand to benefit disproportionately from the services they provide to later members.  However, those involved say the costs are designed to be equitable.  While prices to join as a licensing member have not been disclosed, the fee is expected to be the same for founders and licensees. As such, those involved pushed back against criticisms of the model.  ""There is absolutely no difference in using the platform, regardless of whether we are shareholders or not,"" said Mancone. ""We all end up being users of the platform provided by the joint venture.""  ""We're confident that the value-add is proportionate to the cost to onboard,"" he emphasized.  Permeable borders  But there's another reason why We.Trade's founders aren't worried that the tiered model might discourage people to join: members can always upgrade.  According to Mancone, a smaller number of founders were selected simply because it's faster to build a system with fewer parties, and not everyone even wants to be involved in that process.  As the product matures, additional members are expected to upgrade to equity status, as happened earlier this month with Spanish bank Santander. Santander's head of network banking, Fernando Lardies, cited We.Trade's ""speed of progress"" among the reasons his bank wanted to get involved in the product development.  And so far, the effort isn't a disappointment in this regard.  The joint venture is expected to be completed this month, followed by a live launch of its platform in Q1 of next year and an expansion beyond Europe in 2019.  But even as Lardies explained why his firm became an equity member, he advocated for the potential benefits that would come if his firm had simply licensed the platform.  ""Additional equity members are possible, we are counting on it – although an indefinite number of shareholders will have its drawbacks,"" said Lardies, concluding:  ""We are sensitive to concerns by user members to be able to influence product evolution.""

42428028,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5Fvh,1509433229,Bitcoin Cash Developers Propose Date for November Hard Fork,"The open-source developers behind bitcoin cash appear to be sticking to their word.  Following a pledge in August to change the code as necessary to stay competitive, the developers behind the alternative bitcoin software took a step toward following through this week. In a post yesterdayhttps://www.bitcoinabc.org/november, developers behind one of the bitcoin cash clients revealed they will seek to change the software's rules via a hard fork on Nov. 1.  To be activated on Nov. 13, the new software will seek to adjust rules set in the initial split with the bitcoin blockchain, one that also hints at larger criticisms about bitcoin cash's economic network. In particular, the change will attempt to reverse a piece of code, called the emergency difficulty adjustment (EDA) rule, meant to help bitcoin cash better attract miners willing to secure its blockchain.  As bitcoin and bitcoin cash both use the same mining algorithm, miners operating compatible hardware have shown a willingness to switch between the networks. As such, the idea behind EDA was that mining difficulty could be dynamically adjusted down as necessary to attract miners with profits.  However, while beneficial after the launch, developers believe the rule has outlived its utility to the network.  ""This is problematic [now] because it prevents consistently fast confirmations for users, and radically shifts the coin issuance schedule,"" the post reads.  In its place, a new algorithm would adjust every 600 seconds, based on the amount of computing power that was provided to the network over the previous 144 blocks. The idea is that difficulty would be adjusted quickly, in response to real-time miner activity.  According to the post, members of the development team are now in touch with exchanges, wallets and miners in an attempt to raise awareness for the proposal.

42428013,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5FRh,1509422446,Devcon3 Preview: 6 Talks to Watch At Ethereum's Developer Summit,"From $72 million to $28 billion – ethereum's value has skyrocketed in 2017.  Once dismissed as just another cryptocurrency, the protocol has won praise for its persistence in charting an innovative course in technology development. Indeed, for many investors, the conversation is now bitcoin and ether first, a sign it's set itself apart from the broader asset class.  That said, roadblocks remain between ethereum and its goal of fulfilling its value proposition and becoming a ""world computer.""  It's against that background that programmers and enthusiasts from around the world are descending on Cancún, Mexico, this week for the protocol's flagship developer conference, Devcon. An annual event, Devcon3 sold out back in July and features 128 sessions over the course of its four-day program.  There to present will be several of the platform's most prominent technologists, including ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) developer Nick Johnson and Cornell University professor Emin Gun Sirer, who will no doubt speak to the network's pressing issues.  A look at the schedule shows that ethereum developers have their heads down on a variety of projects aimed at bringing the platform to fruition, with perhaps scalability and privacy emerging as the big touchpoints.  Can't make it to Cancun? The Ethereum Foundation is streaming the entire conference live.  With that in mind, CoinDesk has compiled its list of the top six talks to watch:  1. Casper the Friendly GHOST: A correct-by-construction blockchain – Vlad Zamfir  Perhaps the most-anticipated of ethereum's projects, Casper looks to completely rewire how ethereum works.  Vlad Zamfir, who leads ethereum's more experimental research into proof-of-stake, is one of the best-equipped to speak to this topic, but he's also known for holing up and not chatting much about his research. So, this talk could shed some much-needed light on how far along the research actually is.  Along those lines, Zamfir told CoinDesk that he will be ""publishing a lot of information"" about his approach to proof-of-stake in the near future, without giving specific details on what's to come.  2. Scaling Ethereum Smart Contracts – Joseph Poon  While moving the network to proof-of-stake is touted as a way to increase the efficiency of the network, it's not a silver bullet for ethereum.  To support the number of users that Google and Facebook support – companies that ethereum developers want to one day replace with decentralized applications – the network will need to scale immensely.  With ethereum nearly at its limit already, off-chain scaling is a hot topic as well, and Joseph Poon, the co-creator of leading bitcoin scaling solution Lightning Network has an idea for ethereum.  He'll be presenting on Plasma, an off-chain scaling solution that takes some inspiration from Lightning.  3. Designing Maximally Verifying Light Clients and Sharding – Vitalik Buterin  Vitalik Buterin is sure to draw a crowd, and this session looks to add onto the scaling discussions by speaking on two budding technologies he's been researching.  One is light clients, which are a type of ethereum node that stores less ethereum data, making nodes run more efficiently. The second is sharding, a theoretical way of splitting up ethereum so that users only need to carry a slice of the blockchain history, again an effort to make using the network less cumbersome.  With a good amount of power as to the path the network will take, Buterin's ideas could be a sign of things to come on ethereum in 2018 and beyond.  4. Mist: Towards a Decentralized, Secure Architecture – Everton Fraga and Victor Maia  Meanwhile, once the core infrastructure is all glued together, there's been significant research into how users might one day interact with ethereum.  Mist, the user interface sponsored by the Ethereum Foundation and the one with the most users, is described as a way of browsing decentralized applications (dapps). By beginning the efforts to design a user interface that's light and fast, developers are proactively planning for a future where ethereum creates dapps to compete with Google and centralized social media platforms.  Ethereum developers Everton Fraga and Victor Maia will update users on the direction they think is best for the wallet.  5. zk-SNARKs Lecture Series  Another major theme of the conference is privacy, and displaying how important ethereum developers believe it is, zk-SNARKS – the privacy tech used on anonymous cryptocurrency zcash – is getting a whole lecture series.  Stretched across five talks, progress here is particularly notable since ethereum developers recently took a small (but bold) step toward adding the privacy technology to the platform.  Representatives from Zcash Company will speak about the bleeding-edge cryptography that shields more data than any other process currently, something many feel will be paramount to getting more heavy hitters, such as financial institutions, to use the network.  6. Whisper: Achieving Darkness – Vlad Gluhovsky  Whisper, ironically, is one of ethereum's quieter projects.  While it's supposed to make messages between ethereum nodes and the network private – a popular topic for ethereum today – it has yet to grab much attention. Although, that doesn't mean it's seen as an inessential component; Ethereum Foundation developer Victor Tron once went so far as to call it one of three elements in ethereum's ""holy trinity.""  In this talk, developer Vlad Gluhovsky could provide some rare insight into where the development of the Whisper protocol is going.  As coders are often seen as reserved when it comes to divulging information about their work, the transparency here and throughout the conference will likely be a highlight of Devcon this year. And with the spike in outside interest in ethereum, it'll be interesting to see whether what developers have planned matches the enthusiasm.
