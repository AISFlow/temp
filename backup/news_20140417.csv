42377157,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zDmF,1397769641,LocalBitcoins Names Malware As Cause of Wallet Issues,"LocalBitcoins users took to reddit and official LocalBitcoins forums today (17th April), reporting that some bitcoin wallets managed by the company have been emptied, and that transactions have been delayed.  The Finland-based bitcoin buying and selling service has now issued an official response to these claims via its blog, stating that the problem is likely the result of a malware intrusion.  In the post, LocalBitcoins announced it would limit hot wallet activity on its services while it addresses the issue.  Further, it released its initial assessment of the situation:  ""So far, we have found one systematic and recent attack against LocalBitcoins users, and right now it seems that the amount of users attacked have been under 30, and amount of bitcoins reported has been less than that.""  The company also downplayed that there were larger issues with the site, stating:  ""Nothing indicates that this [may] have been a security flaw on the website itself, but we are going to continue investigating the case.""  LocalBitcoins said it would investigate the issue further over the weekend,  Malware attack  LocalBitcoins explained that based on the small number of users affected, and the fact that the compromised accounts did not have two-factor authentication enabled, the intrusions may be the result of malicious code.  Read the post:  ""[The] most likely explanation to these attacks [is] stolen user credentials through phishing or malware.""  The attack appears automated, according to the company. It went on to suggest that intrusions seem to be common to users that do not have two-factor authentication in place, and that logins on those accounts are coming from seemingly random IP addresses. Though, at press time, one comment on the post suggested that users who had two-factor authentication enabled may have been affected.  Protecting bitcoins  LocalBitcoins  has decided to limit the transactions going in and out of its hot wallet for hosted storage until it finds a way to root out the possible malware issue, according to the company's forums.  This means that withdrawals are being temporarily delayed:  ""We will continue investigating these cases during the weekend, and meanwhile outgoing transactions might be delayed, since we try to minimize cold storage movements until everything is sorted out. We apologize all inconvenience affected.""  The first thing users should do to protect bitcoins in any wallet is to enable two-factor authentication on an account, which uses a secondary element such as a phone to verify a user's identity.  Another important thing to do is to disable JavaScript, which is susceptible to zero-day exploits. Bitcoin users with balances on hosted or ""hot"" wallets should always consider keeping their main cache of bitcoins in an offline or ""cold"" wallet.  This story is still developing.

42377154,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zDjj,1397765740,Strevus Compliance Software Adds Digital Currency Support,"Compliance software developer Strevus has added support for bitcoin and other digital currencies to its existing compliance software service. The company says it will offer institutional-level compliance and support to bitcoin as well as other digital currencies.  Strevus appears to be aiming to carve out a niche for itself by offering cutting edge know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) features for bitcoin platforms. The company argues that regulators are likely to adopt regulatory mandates similar to those already in place in traditional banking and trading networks.  Easy to deploy on existing platforms  Strevus says its software will offer enterprise-quality regulatory coverage, scalability and security to organisations who intend to trade in bitcoin.  The software allows bitcoin operators to fully comply with existing KYC, AML and Patriot Act requirements, but it can also be updated to meet additional requirements, namely tax compliance. The company says its software can easily integrate to existing exchanges and institutions.  Strevus believes regulators are likely to enforce new tax rules as well as KYC and AML requirements for bitcoin companies. Therefore, it emphasises the fact that its solutions can be used on existing bitcoin platforms.  Ken Hoang, CEO and co-founder of Strevus, said:    “With experts predicting that cryptocurrency will complement fiat currencies rather than replace them, we believe that they will become a viable and efficient value-transfer option. As a managed solution, Strevus provides exchanges and institutions with a persistent, secure and auditable compliance service to manage and track these assets.      Using our technology, these organizations can achieve institutional-grade regulatory compliance for their trade network and be confident that they can meet both current and future regulations.”    Professional platforms for professional players  Founded in 2012, Strevus has raised $5.6m for its risk and compliance software. The startup is hoping to make a name for itself on the back of new compliance requirements for the banking sector. Adding bitcoin support to its software is just the icing on the cake, as a subscription to Strevus’ banking compliance service starts at $100,000.  As more institutional investors take an interest in bitcoin, the need for compliance software and industrial-strength security will become more evident. Last month, Perseus Telecom launched a new service designed specifically for digital currency operators. The company provides high-bandwidth communications used by trading firms and hedge funds in several major financial hubs.  Perseus CEO Jock Percy says the ultimate goal is to facilitate bitcoin trading by large financial institutions and engage “known players” in bitcoin. He said some clients expressed demand for bitcoin services, but they also expressed concerns about regulatory compliance.  This appears to be the niche Strevus is hoping to achieve.

During a segment of Bloomberg Television's ""Street Smart,"" Date commented that, on a personal level, he sees a lot of potential in digital currencies like bitcoin.  ""The thing I like about innovation in consumer finance, like bitcoin, like digital currency, is exactly the same reason I went to the CFPB. How is it that you can take new ideas and make the system work better for people?""  Pros and cons  Date currently serves on the board of directors for bitcoin stratup Circle Internet Financial. He is also the founder and managing director of Washington, D.C.-based investment firm Fenway Summer.  In the interview, Date said that bitcoin has the potential to deliver faster and more secure payments than is currently possible for most consumers, and remarked that the pace of innovation could result in a broader evolution in digital currencies.  Date said:  ""It's entirely possible that there will be variants of other digital currencies, entirely possible that the form of bitcoin will continue to be developed and improved over time.""  He continued:  ""The fact of the matter is that anything that actually solves the problems of consumers and merchants is, in my mind, a good thing.""  Looking ahead  Date also pointed to the evolution of the bitcoin business ecosystem as a positive development. Date held up the example of the liquidation of Mt. Gox as a sign that companies in the space are maturing.  He said:  ""The new firms in this marketplace are considerably more serious-minded, consdierably better financed and take these things seriously.""

42377158,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zDnV,1397757905,Meet Adam Draper: The Man Behind 100 Bitcoin Startups,"Adam Draper is the founder and CEO of Boost VC, a California-based startup accelerator that focuses on bitcoin related companies.  Draper sat down with CoinDesk last week at Inside Bitcoins NYC to discuss the evolution of Boost VC, his interests in bitcoin, and his role in the digital currency industry.  It's a bold statement to make: Back in March, Adam Draper told CoinDesk that Boost VC planned to accelerate 100 bitcoin companies in the next three years.  While there's certainly no shortage of entrepreneurs looking to enter the digital currency space, Draper's commitment to focus on bitcoin startups with his 18-month-old accelerator carries with it a particular level of risk. The industry is still in its early development phase, and the uncertainty surrounding future regulation could have far-reaching impacts for companies built on the Bitcoin protocol.  Nonetheless, it's a risk that Draper is willing to take.  Learning from the best  Draper is a fourth-generation venture capitalist who grew up watching his grandfather and father navigate careers in the industry.  Technology, of course, moves very fast. Though Draper's father Tim Draper was a pioneering venture capitalist during the early years of the Internet, Draper said that the startup climate is much different today than when his father and grandfather started their careers:  ""It's crazy how much things have changed in such a short amount of time. If you want to start a business today, all you need is $80, a bank account and some code.""  Draper noted that his father's venture capital firm DFJ was the first firm to ""only back Internet companies"", and that this set an example for him to take risks. Now, Boost VC is betting big on bitcoin.  Growing up fast  Draper founded Boost VC in late 2012 and the company has accelerated more than 40 startups over the course of three sessions, including companies like Gliph, BitWall and Coincove, to name a few.  The first session of Boost attracted roughly 70 applicants, Draper said. This number grew larger for the second session, and by the third session upwards of 500 startups applied for a spot in the accelerator program.  Said Draper:  ""When we announced our plans to accelerate 100 bitcoin companies, there was a huge response from the community. It showed us just how much interest people have in this space, and also how disruptive this technology really is.""  Similar to other accelerators, participants in Boost VC's program receive an investment in exchange for equity in the company. Boost also provides a network of mentors for its startups and housing in downtown San Mateo, California.  Draper said that he was surprised at how valuable the live-in situation has been for participants in the accelerator. He cited the close proximity in which the startups work as a benefit of the program. Many of the startups bounce ideas off each other and provide valuable feedback to their peers as they progress in the accelerator.  An ambassador for bitcoin  With Boost's commitment to accelerating 100 bitcoin startups, Draper undeniably has a lot of skin in the game. Bitcoin solves many problems that are inherent to today's global economy, Draper said, and he has been most surprised by how quickly bitcoin's popularity has grown and how resilient the technology has been over the past couple of years.  When asked by CoinDesk where he sees himself fitting into the digital currency industry, Draper explained that he's aware of the influence that he and his team at Boost have:  ""I do feel like an ambassador for the community, in a way. I've never been so public about supporting something as I have been with bitcoin, and I'm grateful to be able to help grow the industry.""  While Draper's peers in venture capital may think Boost's devotion to bitcoin is ""crazy"", he wouldn't have it any other way:  ""My job wouldn't be possible without all of the crazy and talented entrepreneurs who are putting all of their hard work into developing new products and services around bitcoin's technology.""

42377151,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zDeh,1397752504,China's Banks Close More Bitcoin Accounts Following PBOC Deadline,"There is continued uncertainty for bitcoin exchanges in China tonight as some large-volume exchanges reported verbal closure notices from banking partners today.  Exchanges OKCoin and Huobi said they had bank accounts closed as of Friday afternoon China time, posting the news on their respective sites.  China has still not 'banned bitcoin', despite certain rumors. The implied restrictions refer only to the way bitcoin exchange accounts are funded by their users, and there is no word that withdrawals from exchanges or any other bitcoin transactions are affected.  That said, what follows is a public announcement from Chinese exchange CHBTC and a translation of its subsequent conversation about the issue with one of its banking partners.  The initial announcement read:  ""With a heavy heart we are announcing this news, as of 4:15 fourteen exchanges have received communications to have part or all of their bank accounts closed, and the community including us were ecstatic that everything had passed, but as of 10am on 4/17 we officially received notification from the Bank of China Beijing Baijiazhuang branch to close our account, and after verification by our senior management in Beijing, we are carefully making this public statement.""  Phone call  The telephone conversation between CHBTC and its banking associate went as such:  CHBTC: Has the bank received specific directives in the form of documentation?  Bank: It is not convenient for us to answer that, but prior to this we did not know your company was engaged in the bitcoin business, and so since we can find and call you, you can understand that someone has been eyeing all the company accounts used to do bitcoin business, and proactively told us.  C: Must we close our account; can we just zero out our balance?  B: Well it is up to you, however you know that someone is eyeing your account, do you think that it would be appropriate [to keep it open]? since I am making this call to you today, the meaning should be very clear, and I hope that you guys won't make it difficult for me, and I can't be more explicit than this.  C: what happens if we do not want to close our account, and insist on waiting for a document/notice?  B: Then it is up to you. We are calling because we would like you guys to close your account. If there are new notices, we might just directly execute; in any case you guys should transfer the account's balance to another bank card, and then engage in the process of closing down your account.  C: OK then, we will cooperate! prepare to close the account.  B: Your cooperation is much appreciated.  C: Can we know when you received the notice, was it before 4/15, or is it in the past two days?  B: It is not convenient for me to disclose the specific time, but for us we wouldn't dawdle over such matters, so you can figure it out yourself.  C: Do we have to close down both business and personal accounts?  B: I am only in charge of personal accounts, but my colleague for the business account will also contact you immediately.  C: do we have specific account closing time?  B: As fast as possible!  One of many  CHBTC added that these messages came from just one of its banking partners, and it had not received any similar notices from other business associates. It was, however, preparing for that eventuality and would not be using personal bank accounts to fund exchange accounts in future.  Chinese exchanges will no doubt find other ways to serve their customers, the most likely option being the voucher system pioneered by BTC China in which third-party code numbers are used to deposit and withdraw funds.  BTC China's CEO Bobby Lee told CoinDesk all of its bank accounts are still open.  ""Contrary to some rumors, we still have not received any notices from any of our banks or the PBOC, requesting to close accounts. All of our customers can continue to use our banking deposit channels to fund their exchange accounts on BTC China,"" he added.    This article was co-authored by Jon Southurst and Rui Ma.

42377166,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zDyp,1397748665,"The Evolution of Bitcoin, from Behind a Berlin Bar","These days you won't have any problems spending your bitcoins. You can book flights, buy apartments and eat and drink your way through most of the world's major cities. But three years ago things were different. Then you had to fly to Berlin and make your way to a small bar in the city’s Kreuzberg district if you wanted to spend bitcoins.  Room 77 in the German capital is celebrating three years of accepting the cryptocurrency. The exact date is not really clear but the owner of the bar, Joerg Platzer, approximated that it was around May 2011 that he accepted the first bitcoin transaction for a beer.  Unless challenged, he will continue to claim that it was the world's first purchase with the digital currency in a shop, restaurant or bar.  Then and now  Things have changed dramatically since then. Bitcoin has seen highs and lows, it has been embraced by many and discredited by others but it has continued its march towards global recognition.  Back then, Platzer explained, he was happy if he had one or two bitcoin purchases per month; now he has up to 10 purchases per evening.  Back then people would turn up with their laptops and manually type in the address codes to make transactions; now young hipsters show up with their smartphones and make transactions like it’s the easiest thing in the world.  Back then Platzer would be ecstatic if four people showed up to a bitcoin meetup; now his bar fills up on the first Thursday of every month when the local enthusiasts meet.  Platzer described himself as an old-school “hacker, lock picker and phreak”. In his circles there was talk of a decentralized digital currency for years, and when he heard about bitcoin for the first time he knew he was on to something big. He said:  “I felt 20 years younger. This was the sort of money I read about when I was young. I just said, 'lets go for it'.”  He put up a sign advertising that bitcoin was accepted in the bar, and waited for the first customer. And waited, and waited.  “Everyone was laughing about it and people were asking 'what is this funny bitcoin stuff [that] was on the wall'. The staff just shook their heads and said it was some strange thing the boss liked.”  Accepting bitcoin in those days was not a business decision. Of course there were the advantages of low transaction fees and not having to handle cash but in the end, it was very much an ideological decision, Platzer said. He looked for a way to decrease the power of the banks, and given the small scale of his bar, he thought he'd found a way in bitcoin.  “In my opinion our society has a huge problem and that is called banks and central banks – and we need to overcome those structures ... We are now looking at a future where no one will have to use banks anymore and that means that we can let a bank fail.”  Ideologues vs Entrepreneurs  But over the last year a new type of bitcoin enthusiast has entered Platzer's bitcoin world. A typical bitcoin user is now as likely to wear a smart suit and work in an office as he is to wear a hoodie and argue for the end of capitalism. The bitcoin entrepreneurs have arrived and Platzer isn't all that happy about it.  People became attracted to bitcoin because it offers a free or low-fee transaction and a lack of regulation, but now, he said, some are arguing for more regulation as a way to legitimize the currency in the eyes of financial institutions and governments. Said Platzer:  “I look at these entrepreneurs and say, ‘You want something regulated?’ You have something regulated. It is called money – just use that.”  Platzer is certain his side will win the fight over regulation. There is no way to regulate bitcoin, he contended, as it goes against the coding. But more importantly, if the regulation side succeeds, people could just move to the next altcoin. “The genie is out of the bottle,"" he said, ""there is no going back anymore.”  As the history of bitcoin continues to be play out across the world Platzer sits back in his own bitcoin kingdom smiling. He said:  “Bitcoin is still an experiment ... That’s why I think it is funny that people demand stability. You can’t demand things from an experiment. Just go and pay with your MasterCard if you want stability.”  Photos by Jona Kallgren",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Jona Kallgren,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/17/the-evolution-of-bitcoin-from-behind-a-berlin-bar,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/588511aa25bf93158cb10a92517d744c15b586dc-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Blockchain.info is the world’s most popular bitcoin website, which is no small feat. Additionally, the company is expanding beyond wallets to other bitcoin-related services, recently acquiring ZeroBlock LLC, the world’s most popular bitcoin mobile app.  Interestingly, the domain's homepage links to various Blockchain projects, and denotes the bitcoin 'B' with the unicode 'Ƀ' symbol – an alternative to the double-dashed 'B⃦'.  This has been chosen by a website of industry members (including ZeroBlock and Lamassu) as a way to better legitimize bitcoin as a symbol in print and online.  The group argue that having a symbol in the standardised form would better convey the currency to the masses across various forms of media.

With a hefty asking price of 22,305.134 BTC (or $11m), this yacht is being advertised on BitPremier, an online bitcoin-only luxury marketplace.  The yacht comes equipped with a fly bridge and bridge deck, sky lounge, master stateroom, two VIP staterooms, a VIP Head, two guest staterooms, two guest heads and a dining room – among other features.  It build is still in its final stages, so if you were considering splashing out you'll be able to customize the final details to accommodate your needs.  If this is slightly out of your budget, you can always rent a yacht with your bitcoin from luxury yacht service The Advantaged Yacht Charter and Sales in Miami Beach.  The company has 26 boats ranging from $1,200 to $18,000. They officially started accepting bitcoin in October 2013, but their first bitcoin booking came this February.  Other extravagancies on BitPremier  The mega yacht’s asking price may sound like it is going to have a hard time selling, but BitPremier has successfully sold many other high-value items in the past.  This includes a $500,000 villa in Bali which found a buyer back in March. The 3,000-square-foot villa at the delMango Villa Estate was the site's most expensive item sold, until now.  That's one reason Silbert reckons this yacht will end up selling:  ""A year ago, selling a villa in Bali for bitcoins seemed far fetched, but we were able to successfully facilitate that sale, so who knows what the future will bring? A lot depends on the price of bitcoins.""  Other items currently listed on the site include Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show tickets priced at $19,600 (40.087 BTC), a sub orbital space travel trip for $100,000 (204.96 BTC), and a 3.01 carat natural diamond for $260,000 (526.316 BTC).
