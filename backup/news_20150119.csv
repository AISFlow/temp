42377944,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LY8R,1421697340,"BBA, Payments Council Respond to UK 'Call for Information' on Digital Currencies","The BBA, the leading group representing the UK's biggest banks, has issued a response to the government's 'Call for Information' on digital currencies.      The request, issued in November last year, set out to provide the government with the necessary information to fully understand digital currencies.      The document consisted of 13 questions, ranging from the potential benefits of digital currencies, through to government involvement and new services facilitated by blockchain technology.      The request remained open for a month to allow individuals, businesses and other organisations to submit their comments on various issues. Its closure on 3rd December, was met with a flurry of debate.      The UK Digital Currency Agency Association and several other companies published their opinions of the request. Its 46-page response outlined the need for digital currencies to be considered 'financial measure' and thus regulated in the same way as the foreign exchange and gold. The UKDCA called for a light touch from regulators, arguing that over-regulation could potentially stifle innovation.    The BBA response, a joint collaboration with the Payments Council, began by welcoming the UK government's request before going on to consider both the benefits and risks associated with digital currencies.    ""It is clear that the use of digital currencies and in particular their underlying infrastructure and functionality is growing, and we support the approach of HM Treasury in issuing this Call for Information, as this provides a basis for further discussion on the UK position in respect of this emerging market.""            Anonymity and crime  The document identifies anonymity and crime as potential risks associated with cryptocurrencies, saying ""digital currencies have a number of features which could easily be exploited by criminals, terrorists and states seeking to launder illicit funds and evade sanctions"".  It continues:  ""Any intervention in digital currencies in the UK should seek to mitigate these risks to allow consumers and businesses to use digital currencies for legitimate purposes.""  The response argues that there are additional technologies available that can be used to provide greater levels of anonymity, notably The Onion Router and tumbling services, but these may prove too expensive for bitcoin startups.  Currently, payment service providers are required to prove that transactions are legitimate. At present, however, they are unclear on their responsibilities with regards to servicing those working with, paying or receiving digital currencies.  User anonymity, coupled with the transnational nature of digital currencies, creates significant difficulties in sanctions screening. The BBA and the Payments Council claim that ""if these significant compliance risks are not addressed, it may hinder the ability for digital currencies to become mainstream"".  Monetary and financial stability  The financial system and the UK economy as a whole depend of the stability and integrity of the UK payments system.  ""Regulation should attempt to limit unintended consequences,"" the report concludes.  Despite the fact that digital currencies are often issued uncontrollably, the document says that the impact that can have on monetary and financial stability is ""limited"", given the size of the digital currency market; global bitcoin transactions are currently estimated at 60,000 per day, 300 of which occur in the UK.  It does point out, however, that if convertible digital currencies were to reach mass adoption in the UK, it's possible this may have an increasing effect on sterling.  Potential benefits  The document states that digital currencies may offer a number of potential benefits to legitimate users, including ""reduced transaction costs, faster transaction speeds, financial inclusion, competition and innovation"".  Although the statement notes that the UK's Faster Payments offers many of the same benefits as digital currencies, the latter may provide lower costs and benefits to customers when it comes to cross-border payments.  Refering to the advantages of digital currencies, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said in his Innovate Finance speech:  ""These alternative payment systems are popular as they are quick, cheap and convenient [...] I want to see if we can make more use of them for the benefit of the UK economy.""  If the identified risks are addressed, then both organisations agree that potential benefits for the wider UK economy might include positioning the UK as the centre for digital currency expertise and introducing an additional channel of tax revenue and investment.  The recording of transactions and their subsequent public audit trail could support financial crime control with effective international cooperation. It would also mean fewer barriers to cross-border trade, faster settlement time for payments, lower transmission charges and lower charges for cross-border e-commerce and money remittance as well as the enhanced ability to carry out micropayments.  The response touches on the innovative use of distributed ledgers that support decentralised payments.  It notes:  ""The ledger technology offers potential opportunities to fundamentally change the way many value transactions both within and outside the payments system, including the distribution and communication of assets, company shares, and securities.""  It finishes saying that distributed ledger technology is open source and in its early days, and it may therefore be reasonable for any 'intervention' on the core technology to be light touch, ""so as to support continuing innovation in a positive way"".  Call for regulation overseas    The document explains that the existing regulatory framework for the payments system means that consumers are able to enjoy a high level of confidence and basic protection whilst completing a transaction. However, it points out that such a level of protection is not currently being offered to digital currency users.      To address the issue, the collaborative report reads:      ""It is essential that support for the introduction of digital currencies is subject to ensuring the same standards of consumer protection and confidence are maintained.""            The joint response comes amid international efforts calling for further regulation. Union Progreso y Democracia (UPyD), a Spanish political party, submitted a proposal to the country's Congress explaining why it believes bitcoin regulation is necessary last week.  The Spanish proposal followed the New York Department of Financial Services proposed BitLicense regulatory framework for digital businesses in July last year. This included compliance and capital requirements, customer protection, anti-money laundering and cyber security, reporting and financial disclosures.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/19/bba-payments-council-respond-to-uk-call-for-information-on-digital-currencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/101c799d83c37b61f15e2bd423e8c732cbbdd9cd-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377955,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LYNX,1421688295,DigitalBTC Selloff Prompts Questions from Australian Securities Exchange,"Australian bitcoin company Digital CC Limited, which trades as 'digitalBTC', experienced a big selloff on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) last Friday.  The sudden and drastic increase in trading volume prompted the ASX to send a formal notice to the firm the very same day, asking whether or not there was any undisclosed information that could have prompted the selloff.  The firm started trading on the ASX following a reverse takeover of Digital CC Limited last year.  Following the bitcoin price crash on 14th January,digitalBTC's trading volume spiked from under 10,000–48,000 shares per day to 416,125 shares last Friday.  Company blames bitcoin slump for spike in volume  In response to the ASX notice, Digital CC secretary Rachel Jelleff said the company was not aware of any information which would explain the recent trading spike, as all relevant information was disclosed to the market already.  Jelleff went on to explain that the low price of bitcoin was the most likely culprit behind the selloff:  “In recent days the bitcoin price has hit a 12 month low of $173, from a price of over $800 in January 2014. The current bitcoin price impacts the profitability of the company’s ongoing bitcoin mining activities and the value of its bitcoin inventory, which is what the company believes is the reason for the recent price movement.”  Jelleff said Digital CC Limited is continuing development of consumer applications and is seeking to fast track the launch of these products in the coming months to become a “vertically integrated payment technology company”.  “These new consumer bitcoin applications will be the focus of the company’s resources and a key driver of its future growth and value,” said Jelleff.  Digital CC stock takes a beating  Shortly after it was listed on the ASX, the company’s share price passed AU$0.30 and six months ago it was relatively stable in the AU$0.32–AU$0.34 range.  However, as the price of bitcoin went down in the second half of 2014, so did Digital CC’s share price and by mid-October it had dropped below the AU$0.20 mark.  The share price was holding steady near the AU$0.15 mark for several weeks leading up to the selloff, but on 16th January it dropped to a new low. The share price currently stands at AU$0.091. The company has 84.41m outstanding shares and at press time the market capitalisation was AU$7.68m.  Jelleff said the company “has been very fortunate” to be at the forefront of bitcoin mining, which generated nearly $10m in revenue over the last nine months, describing the result as exceptional for a tech startup.  “To maintain profitable operating margins in its mining activities given the recent decrease in the price of bitcoin, the company has been renegotiating power and other operating costs to maintain competitiveness in a lower bitcoin price environment which currently exists,” she said.  Staying competitive in the current climate  Digital CC started exploring alternative energy sources several months ago and, in August 2014, entered a multi-year hosting and power supply contract with an Icelandic company.  The company released its Q3 earnings report in October 2014, In the Q3 report, the company reported an operating loss of $261,000, but also confirmed that it had a substantial bitcoin cache of approximately 8,800 BTC. The Q4 2014 report is due to be published soon.  Since it is currently the only bitcoin mining company listed on a major stock exchange, digital CC offers a rare glimpse into the inner workings of mining operations through its regulatory filings.  Privately owned mining operations tend to be secretive and, with no reporting requirements, such information is usually hard to come by.

42377962,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LYSZ,1421684199,Bitwage Launches International Bitcoin Payroll for US Employers,"Bitwage has launched a new bitcoin-based payroll product that allows American companies to pay employees outside the US in their local currency.  The company's first partnership as part of its international push is with bitcoin exchange Coins.ph, and allows firms to quickly and cheaply pay workers in the Philippines – even if they don't have a bank account.  Jonathan Chester, founder and Chief Strategy Officer of Bitwage, told CoinDesk he sees bitcoin as the singular payment protocol for paying people across the globe.  He explained:  “The core of our products is basically trying to figure out how to bring modern financial tools around the world. We see bitcoin as a way to facilitate that.”  How the product works  Bitwage’s international payroll solution accepts and pays out in fiat currency, but uses bitcoin in the middle to transfer the value from one place to another.  Since Bitwage already has a bitcoin payroll system in the US, it was easily able to integrate with Coins.ph; sending them bitcoin to be paid out at the other end.  Coins.ph customers can choose to collect Philippine pesos or preloaded cash cards, or receive their payments via bank transfers. Even door-to-door delivery of cash is possible.  Chester said:  ""Bitcoin is the best way to get cross-border payments into the hands of both banked and underbanked people.""  Bitwage acts as a invisible middle entity in payroll transactions. Employers usually ask an employee for bank transfer information when they first start working for the company.  ""They’re just routing the [transaction] to Bitwage as opposed to routing the credit to a bank account,"" explained Chester.  The Philippines market  There are a number of players looking to bring bitcoin to the Philippines market, which is largely a cash-based society with a large number of ex-pat workers that remit money home.  Companies like Coins.ph, 37Coins and Boost VC-backed Palarin are all seeking to gain a foothold in this Southeast Asian market.  Cheap labor costs and often good standards of English also mean there are a number of employers in the US that employ Philippine developers, transcriptionists and general office assistants remotely.  However, it’s not easy to send money to the Philippines, as funds can take many days to arrive and transaction fees are often high. An additional hurdle is the high number of unbanked in the country.  Bitwage is hoping to disrupt that scenario by utilising bitcoin's faster transaction speed and relatively low fees in combination with Coins.ph's exchange service at the Asian end.  Bitwage is currently part of Plug and Play’s bitcoin accelerator program in Sunnyvale, California.

42377958,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LYL1,1421678716,KPMG: Bitcoin a Threat and Opportunity for Retail Banks,"'Big four' auditing firm KPMG has published a report identifying bitcoin as both a threat and an opportunity to the banking sector.      The report, titled The Changing World of Money, outlines the factors threatening established retail banks, whilst discussing the potential of cryptocurrencies as viable payment solutions.      It states:      ""New challenger organisations, from banks to peer-to-peer lenders to PayPal and bitcoin are smaller, more agile and quicker to respond to changing trends.""              The document goes on to explain that these emerging forms of payments have ""greater responsiveness to customer needs"", attracting ""affluent, intelligent and profitable customers"".      The issue, KPMG says, is that banks are unable to respond to their customer's needs quickly. ""Their legacy systems, data management, increased costs of regulatory controls and the increasing focus on remediation"" hamper their response speed, it explains.      By considering the three fundamentals of retail banking – lending, deposits and payments – and identifying some of the threats, challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in each case, the report makes a series of tough points for bank leaders regarding the sort of organisations that will thrive in the short and long run.      The biggest issue raised, arguably, is whether the growth of electronic payments, cryptocurrencies and local trading exchanges will eventually eradicate traditional money.    'Giant ledger in the cloud'    Having recognised the potential of cryptocurrencies, the paper encourages economists, policymakers and businesses to start thinking differently about money, whilst highlighting the shortcomings of bitcoin.      ""[Cryptocurrencies] need to operate as a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account"", the report states before adding that:      ""As a medium of exchange bitcoin is constrained by the fact that so few outlets accept it in payment. It is not yet a reliable store of value because its price against national currencies can fluctuate as much as 20% a day.""              Describing bitcoin as a ""giant public ledger in the cloud,"" Jon Matonis, former founding director at the Bitcoin Foundation, is cited claiming that there is no reason why the major banks could not tap into the increasing demand for peer-to-peer cryptocurrency.      Banks could look into operating bitcoin retail transactions and setting up the required systems of escrow, he is quoted as saying.    Payments in a heartbeat    The fact that the future of payment is likely to include all kinds of clever new technologies, many of which are still in the very early stages of development, does not come as news to many.      As an example, the KPMG report describes a recent offering from Canadian firm Bionym, which has developed what it describes as 'the world's first biometrically authenticated wearable payment solution'.      That solution, the Nymi, is a wristband that reads the wearer's unique individual cardiac rhythm, which are unique to each individual. Once authenticated, the device can largely be used with existing contactless payment systems.    Bank speculates on cryptocurrencies    The publication of the report comes after KPMG issued an ISAE 3402 accreditation – a global standard for financial reporting – to digital currency storage device Elliptic, earlier this month.      The Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin 2014 report, titled The Economics of Digital Currencies, also speculated about the emergence of a banking system based on a digital currency.      The report said:      ""An important question that would then emerge is whether banks could be constrained in their creation of broad money without regulatory oversight or central bank involvement in the management of the underlying base currency.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING | WALLET,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/19/kpmg-bitcoin-a-threat-and-opportunity-for-retail-banks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea35b38ae9aaafdd032a9295a7fbc20690261c4a-1260x945.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377932,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LVcR,1421669560,Markets Weekly: Seeking Answers After The Crash,"Bitcoin's price over the past week was a scene of panic for many, but also jubilation for some, as it plummeted by over $100 over two days, only to quickly regain half of those losses. The well-prepared trader would have profited from this intense volatility.      The bitcoin price opened the week at $267.09 and closed at $209.63, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. That's a loss of $57.46 or 22% over the seven days.      The biggest story, of course, was the price crash in the first days of the week, when the price lost 37% of its value in two days, hitting a low of $170.21 on Wednesday, 14th January.      The price has been in steady decline since last June, when it was trading just above $600, although a brief rally in November took it above the $450 mark. Since then support for the price has been weak, as it rapidly declined to under $400, and then $300 in December.      By early January, bitcoin markets were left wondering how much further the price could drop. It was now trading under $300, with little sign of improvement in the short term.      The answer came with last week's rapid crash, with one trader calling it ""total capitulation"". It seems the markets only had an appetite for coins after they had lost nearly half their value on the way down.    Exchange volumes surge    One sign of panic selling – or capitulation – in the markets is a spike in total trading volume. That's what we saw last week, as exchanges had their second busiest day ever, with 1.43 million coins changing hands on the 14th January alone. That's about 300,000 coins short of the trading spike in November that took place during a brief price rally.    Exchange owners were left to count their takings during the last seven days of frenzied activity. Exchanges like Bitfinex, for example, chargehttps://www.bitfinex.com/pages/fees up to 0.2% for each order executed, with additional 0.1% fees levied on deposits and withdrawals in fiat.    Exchanges don't publish the number of trades executed on their platforms, although volume on Bitfinex over the last week stood at 80,910 coins traded.      Another beneficiary of the volume spike was Kraken, which cracked the top 10 exchanges by total volume for the first time in months, pushing peer-to-peer marketplace Localbitcoins off the leaderboard.      One exchange that will rue the market's timing is Bitstamp. It offered five days of free trading after it resumed service on the 13th, missing a chance to profit from the wave of orders that would peak the following day.    Why did the price fall?    In the wake of the crash analysts were left to figure out what caused it. Pantera was among the first to issue a report with a special newsletter sent to subscribers on the 14th.    The Pantera analysis names margin trading as one of the possible causes for the price decline, pointing to a record high in BTC swapshttp://bfxdata.com/swaphistory/btc.php, used to short the bitcoin price, on Bitfinex.    Pantera also cites the widely held theory that miners are a possible culprit behind the price drop, as those who mine ""commercially"" have to constantly sell coins to recoup costs and turn a profit.      But the fund also offers two novel explanations for recent price weakness. As Bitstamp was taken offline in the wake of a security breach that saw thieves steal about $5m, bids worth roughly the amount were on its books. These orders were cancelled when the exchange suspended trading. As a result,Pantera says, the bitcoin price didn't have the benefit of these buy orders as its decline began.      The fund also says that a rise in venture capital invested in bitcoin firms may also have meant that funds normally bound for a direct investment in bitcoin may now be diverted into companies working on bitcoin instead. This translates into less capital sloshing through the bitcoin markets.    Why the transactions spike?    TechCrunch attempted to perform some analysis on the bitcoin price, observing that as the price declined, the number of transactions on the blockchain peaked.      Alex Wilhelm mused:      ""If bitcoin is more popular than ever, what is driving the price down?""              A look at the data on Blockchain shows that peak transactions for the week were recorded between the 14th and 16th of January, with more than 33,000 transactions taking place in that period. This coincides with a peak in exchange trading volume on the 14th, followed by about three days in tapering exchange activity.      The likely answer to TechCrunch's question, then, is that the rise in transactions showed traders pulling their coins off the exchanges after a couple of days of frenzied activity. Meanwhile exchanges themselves were likely sweeping hot wallets as the amount of funds on their platforms swelled.      In other words, it's not that bitcoin's price crashed while it inexplicably got more popular. Instead bitcoin's price is behaving as it always has: moving in tandem with the markets as traders and the wider economy tries to figure out, sometimes painfully, where its true value lies.

42377929,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LVW9,1421666118,Singapore Government Sponsors Bitcoin Firm to Attend SXSW Event,"Singapore-based bitcoin startup CoinPip is one of 10 technology companies selected by a government agency to represent the country at this year's South by Southwest (SXSW) event in the US in March.  Notably, this is the first time a national government has shown such support for bitcoin enterprise development.  Participating companies are being sponsored to attend by Infocomm Investments, the investment arm of Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA), a government agency and regulator.  CoinPip  CEO Anson Zeall told CoinDesk he aims to use the appearance at SXSW to raise awareness of CoinPip and its services, and to show that bitcoin is not only a currency, but a technology capable of many different things.  It is also an opportunity to show off Singapore itself, he indicated, saying:  ""Singapore is a great place for bitcoin startups. And having us showcased by Infocomm Investments is proof.""  The story so far  CoinPip began as a bitcoin merchant services provider and has begun expanding into new territory as a money payroll transfer business. The latest service sends money end-to-end to employees, freelancers and contractors around the world in under 48 hours, using bitcoin as an invisible medium.  The company also recently became a Ripple Gateway. Although that protocol will ""take time to develop"", Zeall said, users who want to participate in the Ripple network or buy its currency, XRP, with Singapore dollars, can sign up now.  This is not the first time CoinPip's efforts in bitcoin have been recognized. The company joined 'Batch 11' of 500 Startups' accelerator program in Mountain View, California, starting last November.  Whether or not CoinPip's involvement in 500 Startups influenced Infocomm Investments' decision is uncertain, but Zeall said the experience definitely changed the company's trajectory for the better.  ""500 allowed us to delve deep into our analytics, get the right insights and take action. It does look like a leap-of-faith pivot, however there were a lot of learnings involved to get to where we are now.""  The company's merchant services will continue with the addition of a new and more user-friendly dashboard soon. While declining to provide figures on merchant numbers or volumes, Zeall said the company serves a number of ""very loyal"" businesses who are dedicated to accepting bitcoin.  CoinPip has operated mainly in the Singapore/Hong Kong market, but also processes transactions to and from the UK, Indonesia, Kenya and Australia. The firm also expressed plans to expand into South America and the US in the near future.  Criteria for selection  Director of Infocomm Investments' San Francisco office, Victor Tan, said that the companies chosen span a variety of verticals, including e-commerce, ad-tech, big data and even space, in one instance.  Startups chosen for sponsorship needed to show they have a ready product or service to show the public, and also that they have plans to expand into or do business with the US. The selection team also looked for companies that would be most relevant and interesting to the SXSW audience.  Singapore government initiative  According to its website, Infocomm Investment operates its accelerator program to ""stimulate the growth of home-grown, innovation driven tech startups"" at the early stage, by working with corporations, universities and professional accelerators.  It also seeks to identify and invest in Singaporean (or Singapore-based) companies with an international presence, investing alongside venture capitalists and engaging in outreach programs, such as participation in trade shows.  Together with the IDA, it forms part of Singapore's Intelligent Nation 2015 (iN2015) initiative – a 10-year plan to further develop Singapore's information technology economy.  SXSW  is a series of annual festivals held in Austin, Texas, that incorporates music, film and interactive technology. The latter component has grown markedly in recent years to become one of the biggest tech startup events in the world.  SXSW will take place from 13th to 17th March.

42377945,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LVp1,1421628838,TNABC Day 2: Bitcoin Industry Takes On Security Challenges,"Day two of The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC) was perhaps most notable for an absence of expected speakers, including Blockstream’s Adam Back, Bitstamp COO Jean-Baptiste Graftieaux and GAW Miners CEO Josh Garza, all of whom canceled scheduled appearances.  However, the development may have been fitting given that the event succeeded at highlighting themes in the industry as opposed to any one individual, with security as the most visible topic of the day.  A number of speeches and roundtables addressed security in both specific and abstract ways. The ongoing issue of how to make bitcoin more secure, whether that means boosting its struggling cloud mining sector, upgrading exchanges and wallets or developing a strategy for existential threats like regulation, seemed present in many sessions.  Dave Ripley, CEO of bitcoin wallet startup Glidera, summed up one of the most commonly cited aspects of this conversation, the security of consumer funds, telling CoinDesk:  “Security is solved for the very technologically savvy user, it’s definitely not solved for the mainstream user.”  Steven Sprague, whose security startup Rivetz presented at day one’s startup stage, articulated this point more specifically, touching on security with a nuance that is often lost in the mainstream media coverage of bitcoin.  “I think everybody understands that the blockchain is an amazing piece of technology, but there’s another half of it, which is ‘How do I send instructions to the blockchain?’”  This emphasis was echoed by TNABC organizer Moe Levin, who told CoinDesk he believes the big question on display at the event was the ongoing battle between convenience and security. However, he suggested other topics might have suffered in light of this emphasis.  “I don’t think enough time was given to how mass consumer adoption will happen this year,” said Levin.  In his closing address, Levin provided an appropriate dramatic weight to this conversation, advising the industry:  “We’re at a juncture now, we must make wise decisions to ensure bitcoin’s success.”  BitGo on security in 2016  “We’ve had too many hacks, too many losses.”  BitGo  CEO Will O’Brien issued this statement early in the day’s proceedings in a talk that focused on his company’s multi-signature bitcoin wallet technology, as well as the larger struggles of the industry to provide users better security.  O’Brien notably illustrated how he expects security to advance in the year ahead. His most direct prediction may have been that 2015 will see the industry adopt a ‘multi-institutional’ security standard that will see companies sharing the responsibility of holding and securing private keys.  “By the end of this year, it will no longer be acceptable for one company to hold all the keys to a wallet,” O’Brien said.  The statements could signal a trend given that 2014 was framed as the ‘year of multisig’ by many in the industry.  Buterin talks sustainable growth  Ethereum  ’s Vitalik Buterin was in attendance for a talk billed as being about the crypto 2.0 industry, though it was geared more specifically toward providing a high-level view of what makes decentralization valuable.  Buterin naturally touched on the issues inherent with centralization; framing bitcoin as just one of many already commonly used forms of decentralized technology, though one with real uses cases.  For example, Buterin cited web link rot, whereby older outdated links die when the websites they direct to are not longer maintained, as a pressing mainstream issue that could be solved by the community.  “If all these websites were stored on a decentralized network, they would at least live forever, or as long as somebody cared about them,” Buterin joked.  Buterin also outlined his five-layer overview of the crypto 2.0 space, a loose category term he said for what has become a “convergence of different technologies”. Overall, his talk was able to articulate how these developing parts of the ecosystem intend to work together, even if the specific details have yet to be determined.  Mining at a crossroads  Security was also top of mind during a mining panel that included BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov, Bitmain’s Yoshi Goto, Spondoolies-Tech CEO Guy Corem, Aquifer’s Anthony Brough, and developer Luke Dash. The panel was moderated by Tally Capital’s Matthew Roszak.  The talk began ominously with Corem describing the ongoing issues in the cloud mining segment of the bitcoin industry, as pervasive, stating:  ”Cloud mining is a real problem for us, there’s lots and lots of ponzi schemes.”  Corem decried some cloud mining companies as “ticking bombs”, making clear that he thinks the issues in the industry are far from over.  Vavilov, whose bitcoin mining company has raised $40m to date, positioned himself as the member of the group perhaps most willing to find solutions to the issue.  “I may be an optimist, but I see the opportunity,” he said.  Elsewhere, Bitmain’s Goto indicated that his company was exploring solutions that would help it provide a stable cloud mining product.  Cloud mining companies aim to allow consumers a way to profit from bitcoin mining without the requirements of managing and operating the machines.  GAW Miners Q&A canceled  Perhaps most notably, a much-anticipated Q&A with GAW Miners CEO Josh Garza did not take place as expected.  The event, drummed up by bitcoin’s rabid Reddit supporters, had all the anticipation of a heavyweight bout. On the morning of today's event, for instance, two of the top four posts were dedicated to deriding Garza and the paycoin project.  Previously, Garza had agreed to participate in a session to be moderated by a member of the bitcoin community that addressed the controversies surrounding his company’s proposed bitcoin competitor, paycoin.  The project recently became embroiled in scandal for actions related to the launch of paycoin, including the planned market support for the project. GAW Miners has notably launched a buyback program for the altcoin, which seeks to alleviate customer complaints.  GAW Miners was a sponsor of this year's TNABC.  Startup stage packs surprises  If some main speakers were noticeably absent, day two of the startup stage saw the surprise appearance of some companies not advertised on the TNABC schedule.  This edition of the event featured distributed storage startup Stroj, bitcoin wallet Airbitz, blockchain rewards program Ribbit.me, decentralized prediction market Augur, Zimbabwe-based bitcoin ATM startup Crypto Counter, bitcoin wallet KrypotKit and crypto 2.0 startup Tether.  The panel of judges, including Roszak, Liberty.me’s Andrew Filipowski, Pantera Capital’s Steve Waterhouse and developer Peter Todd, was sometimes difficult on the startups, asking them pointed questions about their security and market strategy.  One of the more well-received startups was Tether, which seeks to provide users a way to move fiat currencies on the bitcoin blockchain. However, it also showed the limits of decentralized technology in its current state, explaining that it still uses banks to account for fiat dollars.  “Fiat goes into a bank account, it’s audited and the number of tethers in circulation will be audited by the blockchain,” CEO Reeve Collins said.  Overall, the judges seemed split on the sum of the presentations, however.  Todd, a known security advocate, was less impressed, stating bluntly: “Some of this stuff didn’t convince me it would work.”  Roszak, however, was more positive, speaking in his remarks to the excitement that many still feel about the industry despite its recent struggles.  “Love the energy, innovating on the blockchain, we need a lot more of this,” Roszak said.
