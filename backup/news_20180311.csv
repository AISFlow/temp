42428680,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9qfh,1520811003,Making Sense of Crypto Asset Valuation Insanity,"Brendan Bernstein is a founding member of Tetras Capital Partners, LLC, an investment manager focused on investing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain assets.      Cryptocurrency investors are blind to the most important factor of any investment – valuation.  Merely uttering the word ""blockchain"" has been a hypnotic weapon, sending investors into a trance where they clamor to buy at any price.  Tea cup from Get Out: The process of sending blockchain investors into hypnosis.  Raiblocks investors in ""the sunken place.""  This isn’t the first time growth investors have gone wild. Technological innovation typically turns investors into emotional basket cases. Today, a blockchain protocol with any facade of technical aptitude is valued at eight figures.  Throw out a $10-term like ""DAG"" or 'interoperability"" and you’ll get nine figures.  And these low eight- or nine-figure valuations are turning into 10-figure valuations. Wash, rinse, repeat…. The blockchain voodoo is working.  Blockchain investors using jobu to increase protocol valuation.  Well, for people who view tokens as a casino chip instead of an asset who’s value will ultimately converge to fundamental value….  Spoiler alert: this won’t end well.  Crypto assets are ""different""…  Hiding behind the pseudo-science of white papers and platitudes like ""decentralized technology bringing a new era,"" many investors believe crypto assets are ""different."" If transactions increase, the protocol will go up in value…  History tells us it can’t be that simple.  The ""Nifty Fifty"" of the 1960s, a group of 50 stocks that represented some of the fastest-growing companies on the planet, bought regardless of price, epitomizes a case of growth investing gone wild. The goal of the approach was to identify companies with the most optimistic outlooks in earnings growth. The stocks that highlighted ""America’s great stocks"" lists were Xerox, Kodak, Motorola and Texas-Instruments.  These stocks were meant to be bought and held, not sold. As a result, investors disregarded valuation. The prevailing mentality was that ""even if the asset is expensive today it will grow into its price.""  “Hold!” they said. The resulting P/E ratios in 1972 are shown below.  What do you notice about the names above?  The spectacular growth abruptly came to an end for many from technological obsolescence and competition. P/E ratios for the 50 stocks selected collapsed to 10. By 1975, the Nifty Fifty had shed two-thirds of its value.  Remind you of anything  ?  Newly conceived ICOs are raising at valuations in the hundreds of millions and the same venture investors that would scoff at a $500 million valuation in the ""real world"" are lining up to buy tokens with no recourse and without any regards for valuation.  Valuation is the least important factor instead of the most. And as a result, there are 24 early-stage crypto assets with a valuation over $1 billion, most of which only have one value proposition: speculation.  If you were planning to buy a new house, hopefully you’d ask what the price is. But instead, just like with housing leading up to 2008, blockchain investors have been lured into believing that growth alone obviates any need for valuation rigor.  When price starts to diverge from value, and growth at any price becomes the general market sentiment, risk adjusted returns fall dramatically. Crypto investors will ultimately need to have a strategy, other than selling the token to a greater fool.  The long-term crypto investor  The most important factor driving an investment success or failure is the relationship between the price you pay and the asset's worth. A fundamentally strong asset can be a bad investment if too optimistic of expectations are priced in and vice versa.  What tends to get investors into trouble is conflating “interesting asset” with “interesting at any price”. I’m fascinated by the vision for a “world computer”. But that alone doesn’t mean Ethereum is a high expected value bet at a $100 billion valuation.  Objective merit alone is about as good of a predictor of price increases as Jamie Dimon’s forecasts are.  There are two fundamental investing approaches that warrant dissection: value and growth. Value investors look to buy the proverbial one-dollar bill for $0.80. Growth investors look to buy a one-dollar bill that can turn into a fancy new bio-tech drug or consumer application worth $5 10 years down the road. Either strategy can work.  But regardless, both schools of investors still need to accurately price and understand what constitutes “low” and “high” for any given asset. If the asset purportedly worth $1 turns out to be worth $0.25, both investors are overpaying and reducing risk adjusted returns substantially.  Generally, the early stage investment realm is dominated by growth investors due to the difficulty of determining present fundamentals.  Due to the future uncertainty, growth investors like venture capitalists typically require a higher rate of return to compensate them for the risk. According to CB Insights, only 0.91 percent of startups make it from seed stage to greater than $1 billion in value.  Thus, seed valuations need to be less than $10 million ($1 billion multiplied by 1 percent) and returns need to be higher than 100x for the bet to be expected value positive at that failure rate (100x multiplied by .$01 = 1x money). (This is a slight oversimplification but helpful for purposes of this analysis).  The bottom line is that the initial valuation matters and needs to compensate you for the risk.  Many crypto assets are undoubtedly riskier – you’re trading the preferential rights and recourse of an equity investment for a tote bag and a token with an unproven value capture mechanism.  In fact, according to Fortune, 60 percent of ICOs have already failed after just two years – talk about not wasting any time. Required return, or the discount rate, needs to be higher for crypto assets to generate a positive expected value. Given the increased risk, you’d think crypto valuations would be lower than early stage venture capital but instead they are order(s) of magnitude higher.  Because valuations are already in the hundreds of millions, investors need conviction that these protocols will ultimately be worth tens of billions to generate a substantial risk adjusted return (10x–50x required return multiplied by hundreds of millions = $billions).  For those already worth billions the challenge is clearly magnified. Billions of dollars of value capture is not in and of itself a problem. But in crypto it will be for many assets because the only way that a crypto asset can be worth tens of billions of dollars is if it becomes a reserve store of value.  This is a non trivial task, to say the least. Let me explain…  Reserve stores of value  The key to ascertaining fundamental value in crypto is an understanding of [1] economic activity — transactional usage of the token + the store of value component and [2] velocity – how frequently the token changes hands.  The matrix below helps me think about value accrual along these two dimensions using the quantity theory of money – the best framework to reason about currency and token valuation today:  This matrix paints the picture that the only way an asset can ultimately be worth more than $1 billion is if it is in the bottom right quadrant: High economic activity and low velocity. ($10 billion divided by 10 = $1 billion market cap)  Every other quadrant is relegated to the world of nine figures, largely because of the importance of velocity.  Recognizing the importance of velocity, there's been a lot of work done to manipulate it through relatively complex mechanisms. However, I tend to agree with Nic Carter below on most ""solutions"" I’ve seen.  If users are reluctant to hold the token, in more cases than not, there’s no escaping the high velocity that will ensue.  And in the long run, with the proliferation of seamless decentralized exchanges and atomic swaps, the only assets I believe individuals will be comfortable holding a substantial amount of wealth in are those that satisfy the properties of a store of value.  Thus, if you subscribe to the view above, the conclusion is that for a token to have a valuation of above $1 billion it must [1] be a store of value and [2] have substantially greater than $1 billion in wealth held due to the velocity problem. A tall order for most assets in the space, but they’re definitely not priced like it.  Below is a simplification of the matrix above with the additional insight:  If you’re investing in an asset today with a valuation in the hundreds of millions, to generate a positive risk-adjusted return you need those millions to turn into billions. Because only reserve stores of value will be worth billions, you’re implicitly betting that the asset becomes one.  The issue is compounded if the crypto asset is already worth more than $1bn. Even if it becomes a store of value the return may not be sufficient given the high risk. It all comes down to the initial valuation paid.  Warren Buffett, per usual, puts it best:    ""For the investor, a too-high purchase price for the stock of an excellent company can undo the effects of a subsequent decade of favorable business developments. ""      — Warren Buffett, 1982 letter to shareholders    An understanding of these facets will open your eyes to the insanity of crypto valuations.  Slight caveat: This analysis doesn’t include security tokens that are more similar to equity and given the recourse can be worth greater than $1 billion.  Most assets won't become a reserve store of value  Becoming a store of value is not trivial. The best reserve store of value must secure purchasing power over an extended period of time. Let’s break that down.  At the very least, money must first be secure. If security is a concern, high mental transaction costs will prevent its adoption; social scalability is eliminated (a big reason why FDIC was instated, for example). A store of value cannot be vulnerable to replay attacks, buggy smart contracts and double spending.  And because code is bound to have bugs, the development needs to be conservative and only prioritize crucial features. The development needs to be a complete meritocracy – errors cannot be tolerated.  A sound money and reserve store of value must also retain its purchasing power. There needs to be strong predictability to the supply, which guarantees to holders that they will not witness a drop in the purchasing power of the currency. It needs to be highly durable, thus cannot be arbitrarily changed or devalued by a centralized monopoly.  In the case of gold, for example, the durability is guaranteed by its physical characteristics and cost of extraction.  What enables the above in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is the peer-to-peer architecture and decentralization. Decentralization, as defined by Paul Sztorc is the cost of the option to run a new full node:  ""The requirement to run an entire full node may seem like a high bar, but the height is appropriate. With money, other people’s actions (counterfeiting) affect you. The only way for you to know you’ve been paid, is to make sure that every piece of data has followed every rule, and you can’t do that unless you have all of the data, and all of the rules, in front of you. That’s a full node.""  The cheaper the option to run a full node, [1] the less users need to rely on trusted parties to audit when they’ve been paid and [2] the greater the checks and balances against arbitrary rule changes to the system. Together, this allows the durability, censorship resistance and trust minimization that is so critical to reserve store of value functionality.  A lot to ask for. And why, 99 percent of tokens won’t ever satisfy the store of value pre-requisites.  You’ll also notice that usage as a medium of exchange and dAppp functionality is not listed as a prerequisite. There are two diametrically opposed tradeoffs between security and usability at the base layer. The more complexity at the base level, the larger attack surface and higher the cost of the option to run a full node. If the cost becomes prohibitive, users need to completely rely on a trusted third party to verify transactions.    The more we reduce the P2P nature of blockchains, the ""easier it will be governments to cut off their heads.""      Said another way, base layer trustlessness is a necessary condition for a reserve store of value and layer-one transactions and feature richness are not.      Without trustlessness, blockchains start to act a lot like our status quo institutions and they will end up more like a decapitated Napster or our current inflationary monetary system than a reserve store of value. To wrest control of money out of the hands of centralized institutions and live to tell the tale, decentralization is absolutely paramount. If the money you save can be destroyed, there’s no point to doing so.      Job one is to stay alive.    However, individuals are willing to accept various degrees of trust. Ultimately, as holders start saving the reserve store of value, out of convenience they’ll transact in it through second layer solutions that are less trust minimized. But the base protocol first needs to cement itself as secure, trust-less and decentralized. Then and only then can it add all of the fun stuff on top. The low entropy base chain allows the higher entropy use cases to flourish.  The question to ask about every crypto asset is why individuals would hold their wealth in anything other than the most objectively secure, trust-less and censorship resistant asset with the soundest monetary policy.  Ethereum as a store of value  Analyzing ethereum is a helpful case study as it straddles the borderline between a pure utility token and store of value.  It’s possible to justify ethereum's current price as either under or overvalued – and it all comes down to whether it becomes a reserve store of value. Even though ethereum’s core value proposition is not to be a ""digital gold,"" it effectively needs to become one to generate a high risk-adjusted return.  And the same quandary holds true for bitcoin cash and many other assets. How’s that for irony?  The first analysis below projects out ethereum returns in the case it doesn’t become a reserve store of value, using the quantity theory of money.  Slight caveat: Economic activity should also capture MoE payments. For simplicity of this analysis, the sheer magnitude of the upside in activity should capture this.  Even with a 1000x increase in economic activity from $350 million — $350 billion from 2018–2021, the price of the token actually decreases by 90 percent. Because the price is 8.5x overvalued based on actual circulating market cap today, the growth in usage does not bail the investor out for the high price paid.  As the speculation premium contracts and velocity increases, the price will contract to an equilibrium value at a fraction of the total economic activity.  (Despite the precision above, the quantity theory of money is best thought of as a framework to understand which tokens will accrue value rather than a precise valuation mechanism.)  If, on the other hand, ethereum becomes a reserve store of value the valuation is relatively more compelling. The oft-quoted comp for a reserve store of value is gold at a ~$7 trillion market cap. The question is, what is the probability of it doing so? Extremely low, in my opinion.  Ethereum has three main use cases today, none of which bolster the store of value argument: (1) crowdfunding platform, (2) crypto kitties / digital collectibles platform and (3) a platform for hackers to hack each other.  The complexity of the base blockchain materially detracts from ethereum’s potential use as a store of value. The rich statefulness increases the attack surface. And if the “world computer” actually works, a full node is effectively the equivalent of running every computer operation in the world on one server. Imagine having to verify every single Uber trip, Dropbox transaction and poker hand on your computer to ensure the current state was accurate.  Dapps aren’t even live yet and the cost of running a full ethereum node is increasing dramatically. Unless ethereum considerably changes its architecture, users will ultimately be forced to rely on trusted third parties instead of running a full node themselves – and we unfortunately know all too well that “trusted third parties are security holes.” For certain use cases this may not be an issue — but for a reserve store of value it’s absolutely intolerable.  Vitalik helps to clarify this conflict between store of value and medium of exchange use:  ""In the case of pure cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, store-of-value use (“hodling”) and medium-of-exchange use (“buying coffees”) are naturally in conflict, as the store-of-value prizes security much more than the medium-of-exchange use case, which more strongly values usability. With ethereum, the conflict is worse, as there are many people who use ethereum for reasons that have nothing to do with ether (see: cryptokitties).""  The story doesn’t end there: The vulnerability and security of assets held on a Turing-complete protocol, rich statefulness of the base blockchain and high political centralization also detract from the store of value thesis. And the lack of clarity around the monetary policy is an absolute deal breaker.  If users are not certain that [1] their purchasing power won’t be arbitrarily reduced in the future and [2] their funds are secure from buggy code and censorship, savings and liquidity will both be stifled.  With that being said, I don’t want to pretend that the investment world is binary. The key is applying a probability to each potential outcome and deducing the expected value of various opportunities. At the right price, an unlikely bet can still have positive expected value. The issue is when prices no longer compensate you for the risk.  Valuations will inevitably exert their gravity  This essay is not saying that non reserve store of value crypto assets will always be bad risk-adjusted long-term investments. But just that it’s the case today because most are valued greater than $100 million. Early-stage crypto experiments are valued like later-stage successes. The only way to grow beyond the valuations is through becoming a reserve store of value.  When asset valuations drop by a couple orders of magnitude after investors inevitably regain their sensibilities, the equation will be entirely different.  But for the meantime, navigating this cryptocurrency environment will require a fundamental perspective shift. Given where valuations are today, usage and objective merit alone are not predictors of success.  The protocols that generate long-term returns may not necessarily be the ones with the best teams and highest chances of transactional adoption, but instead those that can potentially become a store of value, where the price paid compensates you for the probability of it doing so.

42428661,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9q3h,1520766004,ICO Issuers: Fix the Problem Before the SEC Fixes It for You,"Tyler Kirk and Amy Caiazza are associates, and Robert Rosenblum is a partner, at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati (WSGR).  This article is not legal advice and should not be relied upon as such; it only reflects the views of the authors and not those of WSGR or any other attorney there.        There has, apparently, been significant shock and surprise over recent reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a large number of subpoenas to initial coin offering (ICO) issuers and to ICO gatekeepers who may have been involved in token transactions that potentially did not comply with the federal securities laws.  To a large extent, this shock and surprise is shocking and surprising.  The SEC has been as clear as it knows how to be that virtually all tokens (and simple agreements for future tokens, or SAFTs) are securities for purposes of the federal securities laws.  It is true that the SEC’s initial forays into the crypto space were comparatively gentle. Instead of bringing an enforcement action in the DAO case, the SEC instead opted to issue a report. The SEC also simply told Munchee Inc. to stop its unregistered token offering, and did not bring any further actions against it.  Some participants in the crypto community apparently mistook these actions as suggesting that the SEC would continue to be gentle, perhaps by essentially “grandfathering” pre-existing token sales, regardless of their lack of compliance with the federal securities laws, or by pursuing only the most egregious violations of federal securities laws, such as those involving token issuers engaging in garden-variety fraud.  That was an unfortunate misreading of the clear signals that the SEC intended to send.  Unsubtle hints  The SEC Chairman Jay Clayton’s repeated statements that virtually all token offerings are securities, for example, should have been a clear signal to the market about what was likely to happen. The fact that the SEC had created a cryptocurrency task force headed by members of its Division of Enforcement should have been another.  The SEC is very clear in those few times when it says it may not fully prosecute prior securities law violations; a good example of how the SEC tends to approach those instances was its recent offer to investment advisers with potential fiduciary duty violations in connection with mutual fund share class selections to voluntarily discuss those violations with the SEC. Obviously, the SEC did not make a comparable offer to participants in the crypto community who may not have complied with the federal securities laws.  In any event, the crypto community is now on full notice that the SEC will focus on prior token and SAFT offerings that did not comply with the federal securities laws; and it can generally seek disgorgement and money penalties for such misconduct that occurred within the last five years. The SEC also will insist that all token issuers comply with applicable federal securities laws as they develop their platforms and token markets.  The good news is that none of this means that cryptocurrencies and platforms cannot operate in the US. They can, but they need to do so in compliance with the federal securities laws (and other applicable laws and regulations).  There also should no longer be confusion about what the SEC thinks. The SEC thinks that virtually all tokens are securities, and it thinks that all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations apply to tokens and token platforms. This is, after all, precisely what SEC Chairman Clayton and others at the SEC have been saying.  How to respond?  A token issuer could, of course, take the SEC or private litigants to court, and it is possible that at least some courts would determine that at least some tokens are not securities. In the ordinary case, though, the issuer may first have to move through years of expensive litigation with the SEC or private plaintiffs, during which time it may be difficult to fully operate the platform due to litigation risk and market uncertainty. It also is worth considering that many courts may well agree with the SEC’s position.  Moreover, even if one token issuer is successful in persuading a court that its tokens are not securities, other token issuers may not find much to celebrate. The determination of whether a particular token is a security is likely to be highly fact-specific, so the fact that one token is not a security may not be of much help to tokens with significantly different characteristics.  Accordingly, here is what we think are a few key takeaways and observations following the SEC’s reported recent actions:  “Utility Token” does not mean what you think it means. The SEC believes that tokens that have or will have utility generally are still securities. Legal or other opinions that a token is a “utility token,"" and therefore is not a security, are unlikely to be persuasive to the SEC.  A token does not stop being a security when the related platform becomes “operational.” This is a corollary to the fact that utility tokens often are still securities. Whether or when a token stops being a security is a highly fact-specific question, which likely turns on factors like the continuing degree of involvement of one or more platform sponsors in the token ecosystem and whether the tokens are largely being purchased and held for consumptive purposes or for investment purposes. None of these have any likely correlation to the time a token platform becomes operational.  You can’t add your way out of a token being a security. Whether a token or any other instrument is a security is based on statutory provisions and many decades of carefully crafted court and SEC decisions. None of those provisions or decisions relies on assigning numerical values to various factors and adding them together to try to reach a target score. While some token issuers have tried to rely on purported tests that use such a mathematical approach, the SEC likely will not be persuaded that such a numerical exercise is useful to the analysis of whether a token is a security.  Technical and technological distinctions between tokens generally are not relevant to the question of whether a token is a security. For example, there is no difference in the analysis of whether a protocol layer token and an application layer token is a security. The differences between the two may be very significant for some purposes, but both are likely to be securities to the SEC. Similarly, distinctions between and among terms like “coins,” “tokens,” and “currencies” may have important distinctions in some contexts; there is no distinction in the analysis of whether they are securities.  Is your token really that different from all other tokens? For those token issuers that still want to argue that their tokens are not securities, you may want to ask yourself this: if the SEC thinks that each of the hundreds or thousands of tokens it has seen are securities, what are the fundamental differences between your token and all those others that make your token the only one that is not a security? Do you really want to risk an enforcement action (and potential token-holder litigation) on that distinction?  Crystal clear  There has been legitimate confusion in the crypto community until now on whether, when and how the federal securities laws apply to token and SAFT offerings. There has been an extraordinary range of advice from numerous lawyers, law firms and others, and many ICO issuers may not have had a ready way of determining which advice was sound, which was dangerous, and perhaps which was overly cautious.  That confusion is now largely gone.  For token issuers that have already made offerings that do not comply with the federal securities laws, for token consultants and distributors that may have been acting as unregistered broker-dealers, and for trading markets that may have been acting as unregistered exchanges, it is time to address these issues.  Going forward, many token issuers will undoubtedly find that the federal securities laws, as applied to tokens and token platforms, are clunky and cumbersome, and not well-tailored to their activities. Registration statement forms were not developed with tokens and the blockchain in mind, periodic reporting requirements were not developed with ICO issuers and platforms as the reporting parties in mind, the securities trading rules were not developed with token platforms in mind, and the regulations governing securities exchanges and markets were not developed with cryptocurrency in mind.  Nonetheless, the federal securities laws still apply.  In the short term, ICO issuers and their counsel can work with the SEC to attempt to tailor existing registration, reporting, trading and exchange rules to better reflect the nature of tokens and token platforms.  In the longer term, the crypto industry perhaps can work with the SEC, other regulators and Congress to develop a modified registration, reporting, and trading system that is designed specifically for cryptocurrency.

42428663,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9qBh,1520763013,How XRP's Tech Differs from Other Crypto Assets,"Up, then down again.  In times of volatility, it can seem like there really isn't anything supporting public cryptocurrency networks. But that isn't exactly the case. While they come in all shapes and sizes (so to speak), cryptocurrencies all use the same ingredients – peer-to-peer networking, private key cryptography and programming.  XRP, perhaps the breakout crypto asset of 2018, is no exception.  Created in 2012 and now securing $40 billion in total value, XRP is the third-largest cryptocurrency network today, one that has gained publicity as the company that manages its operations, Ripple, has inked a range ofimpressive partnerships.  One point of criticism that has emerged, though, is that most of the announcements don't have much to do with XRP, but Ripple's other financial products. At least some users have been unaware of the distinction (though CoinDesk has a guide for that).  But even those considering the market (or who may be watching from afar) can benefit from understanding more about Ripple's technology and how it differs from yet another market segment, public cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.  While all three do trade on public exchanges, XRP, as you'll see, doesn't exactly function like the other assets you'll find on CoinMarketCap.  Ledger and consensus algorithm  To start, XRP is a cryptocurrency that rides on the XRP Ledger. (You can think of XRP as similar to U.S. dollars, and XRP Ledger like the Federal Reserve's official database of bills, coins and notes.)  The part that governs how XRP moves over the XRP Ledger is called the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol, or XRP LCP.  Like any distributed consensus protocol, a set of computers run XRP LCP in an effort to determine which transactions that have been sent over the network are valid and, as such, agree on the history of the ledger.  In this, the algorithm faces a similar challenge to bitcoin, ethereum and other more decentralized cryptocurrencies – the double-spend problem, whereby a user might try to send the same cryptocurrency transaction twice in an effort to game the system.  Whereas bitcoin and ethereum solve the problem with a consensus algorithm called proof-of-work (in which miners use specialized hardware to solve complex mathematical puzzles to verify transactions and earn rewards), XRP uses something different. Its construction hinges on a ""trust-based alternative"" to this, in which a handful of nodes are elected to make the ultimate decisions about the ledger's history.  This group of nodes is called the Unique Node List (UNL), and currently, Ripple oversees which nodes get added to the list.  Following the guidance of the UNL, nodes broadcast a vote on which transaction history is correct, and the consistent majority will be chosen to advance the ledger. According to a recent white paper, 90 percent agreement across nodes is required to ensure the safety of the network.  Because the network does not rely on computationally intensive proof-of-work and a whole network of computers competing to verify transactions, XRP LCP can cope with a much higher throughput of transactions settled in around four seconds.  Still, even these details are under experimentation as the company seeks to improve the tech. Ripple researchers Brad Chase and Ethan MacBrough have even proposed a new algorithm named Cobalt as a replacement for the XRP LCP.  Instead of relying on 90 percent node agreement, Cobalt can function with a mere 60 percent.  Nodes and validation network  While the efficiency of Ripple's system is a plus for many, others are turned off by its centralization of nodes.  Although users can individually define their own UNL, Ripple recommends its UNL based on its consistently honest performance over time. As such, because other nodes might fall out of agreement with Ripple's UNL (which defines the transaction history), failure to follow the recommended UNL may result in a botched payment.  There are currently 70 validator nodes and five recommended validator nodes, with all the latter being maintained by Ripple.  This differs substantially from bitcoin and other public cryptocurrencies in that anyone (with the technical know-how) can spin-up a node and start helping secure the network, plus anyone (with the correct hardware) can begin mining.  But Ripple plans to add 11 more recommended nodes, run by trusted companies and universities, this year, and would also like to see all its nodes phased out in time.  “Right now, we see a certain number of third-party validators that are building up a history; they're looking good but at the same time they're still pretty new, so they don’t have the same ... five years of run time that Ripple’s validators have,” Stefan Thomas, the company's CTO, told CoinDesk.  On top of that, Ripple hopes that one day users of the network will be able to define their own UNL based on their own personal parameters.  Development and governance  An area where XRP and its distributed ledger have the most in common is in development.  The full client software of the XRP ledger, named ""rippled,"" was open sourced in 2013, and its development centers around Github.  Like both bitcoin and ethereum, rippled is derived from a system invented by programmers working on the programming language Python, whereby changes are added to the Github as ""improvement proposals.""  In Ripple, these are called a Ripple Improvement Proposals (RIPs), which are presented as a draft and then go through careful analysis before being merged with the ledger.  The vetting process for new features here is just as intense as is on bitcoin and ethereum, where a number of public debates have erupted over the years.  There are a total of nine core developers, who audit the code and execute tests based on proposed code changes, listed on the company’s Github.  Compared to other cryptocurrencies, XRP's core developer group seems thin, although the listed core developers of some cryptocurrencies have not touched the code for some time.  While XRP and its underlying technology have been criticized for being less frequently updated, the company recently released new technical papers that detail the infrastructure and are being put in front of academics for peer review.  Supply and token economics  Whereas bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies have a set number of cryptocurrency units, which are released from the protocol as miners validate transactions, XRP works in a different way.  All the XRP that will ever be produced – 100 billion – were created in 2013. Similar to ethereum's ""gas"" unit, XRP is used to pay the small fees for sending transactions across the network, but instead of those fees going to miners, the XRP is destroyed.  The process acts as an anti-spam measure since people are less inclined to attack the ledger with spam transactions if those transactions cost money.  While this crypto carnage might worry some investors, in November 2017, the company did the math, saying, ""At the current rate of destruction, it would take at least 70,000 years to destroy all XRP.""  Although, there are other worries as it relates to the supply of XRP.  Initially, 20 billion XRP were granted to the founders and creators of the project. On top of that, the remaining 80 percent of the coins were passed to Ripple, which causes many people to worry that the company could use those coins for less than ideal purposes, such as dumping them in a cash grab and causing a large-scale devaluation of the crypto asset.  In response, though, Ripple announced last year it would lock up all remaining XRP into a digital escrow that would slowly distribute the remaining tokens over time.  Value proposition  Yet, many XRP enthusiasts seem less interested in XRP's use to deter spam, and more interested in the possibility that it's used to make cross-border payments by some of the largest financial institutions in the world.  And this year, the industry has seen some of this materialize, albeit if only in pilots and tests. So far, Ripple has announced partnerships with Moneygram and a number of other remittance providers, Santander UK and a slew of other international payment and banking providers.  Not all of these partnerships are focused on utilizing the Ripple product (there are three altogether) that uses XRP. But more and more companies are interested in testing out the use of XRP as a “bridge currency,” meaning customers can convert fiat currencies into or out of XRP in order to speed up trades.  According to Thomas, it’s this liquidity that accounts for the current and future value of the XRP token.  “When you look at what drives value, what drives value is usage,” Thomas said, continuing:  “We think that as a store of value as something that we’re, Ripple Inc., very much invested in the outcome of the doctrine of XRP, by virtue of our holding of XRP, we are obviously believers in sort of long term potential for XRP to rise in value as adoption approves to the token.”  Ripple coin image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | WALLET | XRP,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/03/11/how-xrps-tech-differs-from-other-crypto-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a58ab7498eac01d8af34e76c539580925b374b61-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
