42380694,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8z5nJ,1527017460,Bank of America Patents Blockchain Security Tools,"Bank of America has won a patent for a way to control access to certain aspects of a permissioned blockchain network, newly published documents show.  The patent for a somewhat innocuously titled ""system for managing security and access to resource sub-components"" explains how security tokens (essentially electronic keys, distinct from blockchain-based assets that mimic physical securities) would be used to grant access to certain users to the information contained in a particular block. According to the text, the system would be automated, effectively meaning that the network itself would grant and track access.  Bank of America was awarded the patent on May 22, according to the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). It represents the latest intellectual property development for the bank, which has filed many blockchain-related applications in recent years.  The focus on security and data privacy is perhaps unsurprising, given the sensitivity of the information that Bank of America might look to transmit across the networks. And it speaks as well to the wider issue of security in the crypto space today, given the all-encompassing need to keep private keys safe from malicious actors.  And, as Bank of America itself notes in the patent document, ""with the advent of distributed/decentralized blockchain networks ... a need exists to develop systems ... that manage control over blocks of resources.""  The bank explained:  ""A need exists to provide designated entities/users the ability to readily identify blocks that are relevant to the designated users' concern and, once blocks have been identified, security features that assure that the designated entities/user that are accessing the blocks are, in fact, authorized users.""  According to the text, the automated features would have the ability to grant access to the blockchain network for certain periods of time, depending on the scope of a user's reason for plugging in.  ""Moreover, a need exists to control the access given to the designated entities/users, such as, by way of example, control over the period of time during which a designated entity may be granted access and/or the amount of access granted to the designated entity/user,"" the patent doc noted.

The Supreme Court has barred all other courts from accepting petitions in the wake of the filing of five petitions against the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) move to bar banks from dealing with cryptocurrency companies. The RBI published a circular in early April to that effect, saying at the time that the entities it regulates ""shall not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling [cryptocurrencies].""  The hearing will be held on July 20, according to an Economic Times report.  One of the petitions was filed by a startup called Kali Digital Ecosystems – which planned to launch its crypto exchange, CoinRecoil – has been transferred to the Supreme Court. Two other petitions transferred to the Supreme Court were originally filed in the Delhi High Court and the Calcutta High Court, the Times further reported.  Anirudh Rastogi, a managing partner at the law firm that filed the petitions, told the publication:  ""One of the key arguments made out in the petition was that the circular was not preceded by any stakeholder consultation, which is what the latest order gets to.""

42429111,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrkJh,1526993133,The Auto Industry Is Gearing Up for a Blockchain-Powered Future,"We're all excited for self-driving, even autonomous, cars, and many tout blockchain as the technology needed to make that happen.  But while that conversation is an exciting one today, CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference played host to an array of esoteric use cases for the mobility space that showcase how many executives in the automotive space are currently taking a more conservative approach to applying blockchain technology to the industry.  Sebastien Henot, manager of business innovation at Renault Innovation Silicon Valley, is such a pragmatist, opting for the low-hanging fruit of using the technology to better manage carmakers' supply chains.  “Blockchain can bring cost savings to supply chains thanks to new levels of transparency and auditability, which would be of vital help in the unfortunate event of recalls,” Henot told CoinDesk.  And that process could also mark the birth of automobiles with their own unique digital identity.  “If you have an Audi and you want to sell it to buy a Renault, it would be very useful for the Renault dealer to be able to access the Audi birth certificate and see a standardized history,” Henot said.  But it's still early days, and the process for what kind of data will be shared and how that data will be coded still needs to be standardized.  That's one of the reasons the Mobi consortium, a kind of standards body for decentralized mobility and data sharing, was launched earlier this month with founding members including BMW, Ford, General Motors and Renault, as well as technology providers like IBM, ConsenSys and IOTA.  And while the futuristic use cases made possible by tokenized incentive structures is indeed what interests many members of the consortium, Henot said:  “My philosophy is let’s start small.”  Blocks of miles  According to Henot, starting with the little things, such as certifying the mileage on a car, highlights a very simple, yet beneficial proof-of-concept.  Odometer fraud, or ""clocking,"" whereby vehicle sellers or dealerships tweak the odometer to make it seem that the car has been driven less miles than it actually has, which can increase the value of a vehicle, is not a new problem (other blockchain-based startups have begun developing systems for just this use case).  In fact, around 450,000 vehicles are sold each year with falsified odometer readings, resulting in a cost of more than $1 billion annually, according to a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration study.  As such, Henot believes the blockchain could eliminate this issue around mileage, ""so nobody can tamper with it.""  The team at UK-based Dovu, a startup part-owned by Jaguar Land Rover, agrees. The startup raised more than $13 million, according to current metrics, in a crypto token sale in October 2017, which it will use to incentivize users to behave in a virtuous manner, such as capturing mileage of their vehicles on a regular basis.  Dovu began a mileage capture pilot three months ago with BMW, which enlisted its employees to carry out the test using a simple Dovu-developed crypto wallet.  Explaining the benefits of the system, Dovu CEO and founder, Irfon Watkins told CoinDesk, “If, like BMW, you own a lot of cars under a fleet management arrangement, it’s really useful to know how many miles those cars are travelling every week or every month – rather than every three years.""  He added:  ""By which time you might find you have an asset on your books worth a lot less than you thought.""  Crypto for the environment  Another small step the automotive industry could take to harness the power of blockchain revolves around electric cars.  Dovu is at the forefront of this application as well, using its token as a way to nudge drivers to charge their battery in an optimum way, “that doesn’t degrade the battery, as if it were a mobile phone,” said Watkins.  This use case could potentially push blockchain technology into the mainstream narrative, since so many people, especially millennials, are interested in electric cars for their positive environmental impact.  Spherity, a startup founded by a former technology innovation lead at the largest German utility company, Innogy, is also looking at applying blockchain to electric vehicle charging. The company wants to use the technology to provide an audit trail for ""greenhouse gas accounting,"" so users can trust their vehicles are using green energy (hydroelectric, wind farmed or solar) as opposed to energy generated by burning coal.  Just like people might want to track and trace sustainably-produced food from farm to fork, so too will environmentally-conscious users want a ""guarantee of origin"" on the electricity their car is using, Spherity founder Dr. Carsten Stocker said.  He added:  “Someone who spends $150,000 to buy a Tesla would probably like to have proof they are charging with green energy.""  More than just cars  Still, even while some are starting small, many are fascinated by the future as imagined with blockchain.  For instance, Henot said the future of mobility is not only about making vehicles physically autonomous but also economically autonomous, whereby automobiles ""speak together, negotiate rights of way, parking and so on, using their wallets.”  One such group working towards those cutting-edge applications is the non-profit foundation, Decentralized Autonomous Vehicles (DAV), which describes itself as “the TCP/IP of connected mobility.” But according to John Frazer, a co-founder of DAV, one of the reasons the foundation is able to inspire such excitement is because it doesn't think about autonomous vehicles only as cars and trucks.  “There are many other examples such as autonomous drones, autonomous rovers (a drone that stays on the ground) and autonomous marine vehicles - some are already here, the rest are coming,"" Frazer said.  Among its notable advisers are the former CTO of General Motors, Dr. Alan Messer, as well as the technical lead on the ethereum virtual machine, Dr. Greg Colvin.  Similar to Mobi, DAV is proposing a commons, a standard of sorts, in the form of a free and open-source decentralized mobility network.  And with this, the foundation hopes to see the full potential of blockchain bring about social change within the mobility industry.  According to Frazer:  “Big players are controlling a lot of what is going on right now, but as new and open networks roll out, the silos will be shared and the gatekeepers will become irrelevant.”  Car bumpers image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/22/the-auto-industry-is-gearing-up-for-a-blockchain-powered-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be80aad7bb15c9ada53569bf2bb6d7079c75645e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on May 20 signaled a short-term bullish reversal that could have seen bitcoin rise to $9,000 (target as per the measured height method).  However, the bulls ran out of steam at a high of $8,644 yesterday and prices had fallen back to $8,240 at time of writing – a drop of 2.8 percent over the last 24 hours, according to Bitfinex.  The decline did not come as a surprise, though, given the breakout lacked volume support, and a drop to $8,000 could now be on the cards.  1-hour chart  As seen in the chart above, BTC fell back below the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline yesterday, weakening the bulls and has established a lower-high and lower-low pattern (bearish setup).  While a failed breakout usually indicates a bigger-picture bearish reversal, in this case it means the corrective rally from the low of $7,925 has ended and the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990 has resumed. Thus, prices could drop below the immediate support of $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement) seen in the daily chart below.  Daily chart  A break below $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement) would bolster the bearish setup seen in the hourly chart and would allow a drop to $8,000.  Note, though, that the 5-day and 10-day moving averages are beginning to curl upwards, so if the price moves above $8,408 (daily high), the bulls could make a comeback.  View  BTC looks set to take out support at $8,207 and drop to $8,000 in the next 24 hours.  A daily close (as per UTC) below $8,000 would signal a revival of the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990. In such a case, bitcoin could suffer a deeper sell-off towards $7,500.  On the higher side, a move above $8,408 would open the doors to $8,858 (100-day moving average).  A daily close above that level would signal a bullish trend reversal and could yield rally to $10,000.

42429105,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrk1h,1526979606,China State TV: Token Sales Still 'Rampant' After Central Bank Ban,"China Central Television (CCTV), the country's highest-level government mouthpiece, has hit out at domestic initial coin offerings (ICOs) that it says are still ""rampant,"" despite a 2017 ban.  During its ""Financial News"" program aired on Monday night, the state media outlet said that the ICO ban issued by the People's Bank of China last September had not deterred local investors. Instead, a get-rich-quick mentality is driving a rush into the cryptocurrency space.  CCTV went on to blast the emergence of what the Chinese crypto community calls ""air coins"" – a reference to token projects that are not backed by legally registered business entities – claiming that the number of air coins has increased by 30 times since the ICO crackdown.  ""While many business entities have moved their projects overseas following the ICO ban, a lot of these 'air coins' carried on fundraising in China without migration because they are loosely organized as a temporary team, not even a formal business entity,"" according to the program.  In order to appear to be legitimate, the report said, a typical technique used by such projects is to promote their associations with notable cryptocurrency investors, such as Li Xiaolai, an early bitcoin investor and evangelist in China.  ""99.99 percent of the time, I'm being associate with these projects without even knowing it. There's always this fear of missing out (FOMO) among investors. And when they can't make judgments by themselves, they tend to refer to whoever influential is associated with the project,"" Li was quoted as saying in the program.  The report marks the latest effort by Chinese state media to educate the public about what it considers cryptocurrency market chaos. It also comes at a time when law enforcement agencies in China are beefing up efforts to crack down on schemes that use token sales to raise capital from the public.  As reported by CoinDesk previously, organizers of two cryptocurrency-related projects in China's Xi'An and Shenzhen have recently been arrested by city police forces for alleged fundraising fraud.

42429108,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrkFh,1526976016,Bitcoin Brokerage Denies Tezos ICO Involvement in Court Filing,"Cryptocurrency brokerage Bitcoin Suisse AG has filed a motion to dismiss its involvement in a class-action lawsuit launched against the Tezos Foundation and other entities, saying it had nothing to do with the startup’s 2017 initial coin offering (ICO).  In a filing entered last week at the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California, the brokerage stated that, while it provided blockchain project Tezos with some cryptocurrency conversion services, its actions should not be grouped with those of the company as regards the claims in the lawsuit being brought by Tezos investor Bruce MacDonald.  The filing states:  “Bitcoin Suisse submits that it is not properly named as a defendant in the Tezos litigation because of its lack of contacts with both California and the United States sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction and because the alleged, limited currency conversion services it provided, solely in Switzerland, prior to the alleged Tezos ICO, and its alleged post-ICO conduct, cannot establish liability under Sections 5 and 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act.”  As previously reported by CoinDesk, MacDonald's December 2017 complaint alleges that Tezos violated U.S. securities laws in the sale of its token. Previous lawsuits filed in relation to the ICO also contained allegations of securities law violations, as well as investor fraud.  In its motion, Bitcoin Suisse further distanced itself from Tezos, stating that the plaintiff failed to connect the two organizations in the lawsuit. As such, it claims that the court does not have jurisdiction over Bitcoin Suisse AG and therefore it should not be involved in the action.  Bitcoin Suisse also claims that MacDonald did not even specify a particular grievance against it, writing, ""To assert a claim under Section 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act, a plaintiff must allege that defendant offered or sold a security in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 77e to the plaintiff.""  However, it continues, ""Here, Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege: that Bitcoin Suisse offered or sold a security in connection with the Tezos ICO; and that Plaintiff purchased a security from Bitcoin Suisse in connection with the Tezos ICO.""  In supporting this argument, Bitcoin Suisse states that it did not offer or sell securities. A hearing about the filing will likely not be held until July 19, according to the document.  Tezos completed its initial coin offering in July of last year, bringing in a record-breaking $232 million-worth (at the time) of bitcoin and ether.

Senate Bill 300  , introduced by Senator Matt Dolan, amends sections of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act to include blockchain records and smart contracts as electronic records. Further, the bill allows for smart contracts to be legally enforceable as any other contract may be.  If passed, the bill would add language stating that blockchain technology can be used to store electronic information and provide ownership rights. It specifically states:  ""Notwithstanding any other law, a person that, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, uses blockchain technology to secure information that the person owns or has the right to use retains the same rights of ownership or use with respect to that information as before the person secured the information using blockchain technology.""  The proposed bill went on to state: ""This division does not apply to the use of blockchain technology to secure information in connection with a transaction to the extent that the terms of the transaction expressly provide for the transfer of rights of ownership or use with respect to that information.""  Perhaps more notably, the bill amends language in another section about electronic contracts to include that ""smart contracts may exist in commerce.""  It goes one step further, however: while existing law already states that ""a contract may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because an electronic record was used in its formation,"" S.B. 300 adds ""or because the contract contains a smart contracts term,"" making it clear that smart contracts may be used for legal documents.

42429116,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrkPh,1526961643,ICOs Are Setting Capital Free. That's Revolutionary,"Simon Johnson, co-author of the bestseller ""13 Bankers,"" is the Ronald A. Kurtz (1954) Professor of Entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of Management and a member of CoinDesk's advisory board.  The following article originally appeared in Consensus Magazine, distributed exclusively to attendees of Consensus 2018.      In 1913, H.G. Wells wrote ""The World Set Free,"" a chillingly prescient set of predictions about the development of technology.  Published in early 1914, this slim volume called it exactly right on the coming dominance of aircraft in warfare, the ways armies would adapt (or not) and even some of the geopolitical implications. Most astonishingly, Wells also predicted that atomic bombs would soon be dropped from the air on civilian populations – and that this would change everything.  As we grapple with the potential future of crypto-tokens and related developments, Wells’ volume – and particularly the way he thought about the future – bears closer consideration.  The remarkable point about Wells’ reasoning is that he jumped directly from the fairly rudimentary pre-World War I knowledge of radioactivity and atomic structure to the idea that within this science lurked an explosive device of devastating power. In retrospect, this might seem obvious, but it was not until almost exactly 20 years later that a physicist even conceived of exactly how a chain reaction might take place.  Wells was wrong, of course, about all the details. Anyone who imagines the future of technology will necessarily mess up on all the small stuff. The more interesting question is: if we understand the bigger shifts, can we predict at least the direction of future change?  And – much more difficult – if we can see where this new breed of digital, blockchain-based tokens might lead or what they could become, could we glean any insight into when big things might happen?  What we do know is that one feature of this technology is already triggering a societal and economic shift before our eyes: initial coin offerings (ICOs). While it will it take some time, if ever, before this technology’s advocates realize their vision for tokens to forge a new system of economic exchange and governance, ICOs are making waves right now.  There is obviously a lot of debate about the precise nature of ICOs, including whether or not they constitute securities offerings in the eyes of the law – which, in the U.S., the SEC interprets and applies in the first instance (subject to legal appeals and political discourse, of course). I’m not a securities lawyer, and I am not here taking a position on this question.  Instead, let’s focus on what promoters of ICOs say they are trying to do by selling digital tokens to the public – and what appears to have caught the attention of investors. While many will describe their tokens not as investments but as pre-sold, negotiable “products” with a utility function that gives the holder access to the system’s services, so far the most disruptive aspect of this idea lies in how it changes the fundraising dynamic.  And on that score, the idea is relatively straightforward: someone will build a technology that could be useful to you and others, and that person would like to prefund that in a way that the value generated by that technology is shared with early users (and others who are willing to provide risk capital at this development stage).  Access to capital for risky ventures is a key constraint both for the development of individual firms and for our economy-wide process through which new technology reaches the market. ICOs offer a more direct route for both tapping and deploying funds, for matching founders with investors. That turns out to be quite revolutionary.  History repeats  In the 19th century, before there was a boom in industrial development projects, we built a lot of railroads in Europe and the U.S. The legal form varied somewhat across jurisdictions, but every country that made progress in raising capital did so through some form of Joint Stock Company – liability for investors was limited, and ownership shares could be traded in a relatively efficient forms.  Of course, there was madness and also bad behavior during various railway manias. And we learned the very hard way that unfettered competition can lead to some problematic behavior, either in terms of safety (a lot of people were injured or killed by trains in the early days), the concentration of power (e.g., build railway monopolies and jack up prices), a boom-bust cycle (which can even bring down the financial system and have broader deleterious macroeconomic effects).  We responded over the following century or so with various “soft” or institutional innovations that started in the private sector but ultimately acquired the backing of government.  Dangerous behavior was constrained through the award of legal damages and through the protections demand by trade unions. The predatory pricing behavior of trusts was limited by law and by the executive – Teddy Roosevelt’s first antitrust action was against a regional railroad monopoly.  A central bank was created because, following the panic of 1907, no one was confident that purely private mechanisms could prevent collapses in a severe panic, and securities regulation emerged because the consequences of the Crash of 1929 proved so devastating. David Moss’s compelling book on the rise of the U.S. federal government is aptly titled,When All Else Fails.  Seen in this context, how should we see ICOs – joint stock companies, or railroad ventures, or some combination of both? We don’t know yet for sure, but we can see more clearly the problem that is being addressed – it is relatively hard to raise early stage capital, and under the existing venture capital model it helps to be located in one of a few places (e.g., Silicon Valley broadly defined, Boston and New York).  What about all the people with good ideas who live elsewhere? And what about investors who would like to take some well-considered risk but who are not considered qualified under the existing, rather antiquated rules (which are based entirely on how much “investable” wealth you have). Or what if you have an idea that, for whatever reason, is not on the current wish list for the people who run VC funds?  If there are barriers to entry into venture capital, as seems plausible, it is fairly straightforward to reason that there are very high returns to capital in this sector, at least on average and over a sufficiently long period of time. Who is able to participate in those opportunities, i.e., invest in a VC fund? Not most people who are reading this column.  To be sure, there are many problems to be solved along the way to ICOs – or anything that descends from them – allowing for a more democratic approach to risk-taking. There may be scams or weak governance or just bad ideas – we have seen plenty of each in every previous investment boom. And, to be clear, in any such emerging market situations, you really can lose everything you risk, without recourse or recompense.  Picking up on some of these risks, Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, and Agustin Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements, weighed in recently against cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to bitcoin. Their speeches are quite different but both are wonderfully erudite and elegantly constructed. They focused primarily on the future of money, at least as they define it. Anyone interested in this space should carry copies with them at all time. As Oscar Wilde suggested, it is important to have something sensational to read on the train.  Or you can read H.G. Wells.  Predicting a limited future for a new way of raising capital today is rather like hearing about the properties of radium in 1898 and remarking, “is that all it can do?”  Now, it’s true that anyone who was concerned about the health implications and other unintended consequences of discovering radioactive elements was exactly right – and should have been listened to more carefully. Carney and Carstens make some good points in this regard.  And – this is a point nailed by Wells – any sufficiently profound development in technology cannot avoid having major effects on the structure of society, including the value of firms and who has (and keeps) a good job. All such effects are inherently hard to predict. To those who wish to hurry change – be careful what you wish for.  Still, it is sudden change that generally proves most difficult to handle, and there are good reasons to think we have some time before the full implications of ICOs (and their institutional grandchildren) are upon us. The SEC will apply existing rules in a judicious manner – investors really do need protection, and there is actually bipartisan support on this point. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission may well weigh in regarding how particular instruments should be traded. The leadership of both organizations seem, at this time, to be payingclose and sensible attention to developments.  It should not surprise us if, in our usual empirical and haphazard way, we find a path along which regulation can support more decentralized and lower-cost ways of raising capital. Gate-keepers in the financial world, who do well by controlling various bottlenecks, will come under increasing pressure.  Whatever happens, we should always expect a boom-bust cycle. It is hard to think of an instance of technological change in modern America that has not gone through some phase of exuberance, followed by consolidation and – sometimes – eventual impact.  What we can prepare for  If better access to risk capital lies in our future, what can we say about when this might happen?  This is the hardest question, and it's likely not a good idea to take (or bet on) a strong view. With regard to the future of power generation, transportation and warfare, H.G. Wells was right on the natural course of science – he picked the 1930s as key decade for applications to emerge from the theory of atoms – but he completely failed to anticipate how much the process could speed up once the resources of a well-run country were applied to a problem with single-minded concentration, i.e., the Manhattan Project.  Wells also thought – and this is interesting for the ICO context – that once one country had acquired destructive nuclear technology, almost all countries in the world would follow suit. He was wrong about that. Similarly, with economic and financial innovations, there are plenty of reasons why some countries will struggle to emulate the leaders – typically because local oligarchs prefer the status quo.  In the end, some relatively prosperous countries – this could include the U.S. or perhaps smaller countries with less of a stake in the existing global financial system – will end up with a better way of raising capital and, most likely, an associated change in how corporate governance operates.  Fundamental issues surrounding the protection of privacy will need to be dealt with along the way. A host of related issues to be addressed include the precise nature of disclosure, what meaningful reporting through financial accounting means, and how markets obtain and respond to information.  We should probably also rethink what kind of investment portfolios are recommended at different stages of life. Who should be regarded as an accredited investor, for example in a technology they know well – and when they are in their early twenties (so there is plenty of time to ride the cycle)? Investors need protection, but against what and through what methods exactly?  None of this means that utopia is around the corner or that productivity growth is about to jump upwards. In ""The World Set Free,"" H.G. Wells was too optimistic about the future of benevolent government, and we would do well to avoid that mistake.  But the way capital finds and supports opportunities around the world is not just changing – it has already changed. Spend some time thinking through the implications.
