17282827,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550443,1694129401,JPMorgan Adjusts Bitcoin‚Äôs Production Cost: What This Means For BTC And Its Miners?,"Recent adjustments by JPMorgan in its estimation of Bitcoin‚Äôs production costs have garnered attention. Previously standing at $21,000, JPMorgan‚Äôs revised Bitcoin production cost has now been pegged at $18,000. This move is closely tied to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index‚Äôs (CBECI) decision to update its methodology, highlighting the interconnectedness of financial analyses and industry metrics.¬†Notably, the CBECI is known for its critical role in tracking and estimating the electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network. Related Reading: Analyst: Blackrock‚Äôs Bitcoin Spot ETF May Unleash $30 Trillion From US Advisors Revised CBECI Methodology‚Äôs Impact On Mining Costs JPMorgan analysts, under the guidance of Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, noted in a recent report that the new methodology changes the landscape of Bitcoin‚Äôs production cost estimations.¬†The report revealed: The current Bitcoin production cost falls to around $18,000 with the new methodology vs. $21,000 with the old methodology. According to the analyst, this shift implies that future changes in electricity prices will have a comparatively lesser effect on mining costs. The CBECI‚Äôs adjustments have a broader impact than simply changing estimates. Analysts have discovered that changes in electricity costs can significantly reduce the cost of producing 1 Bitcoin. With the new CBECI methodology, this sensitivity has decreased slightly to approximately $3,800, compared to the previous $4,300 change for every one cent per kWh (kilowatt hour). According to the analyst, this sensitivity is expected to double after the 2024 halving event, which will decrease miners‚Äô rewards by half. This change will amplify the importance of cost management due to the higher impact of electricity costs on the overall mining expenses. Bitcoin Latest Price Action So far, Bitcoin is still very much in the red. Following the asset‚Äôs 13% drop in the past month, slipping below $29,000, Bitcoin hasn‚Äôt made any significant movement aside from a continued downward trend. However, over the past 24 hours, BTC has seen some gains. The top crypto currently trades for $25,902 at the time of writing, up by nearly 1% in the past day. Over the past month, more than $70 billion has been erased from the asset‚Äôs market cap. Nevertheless, the past 24 hours have seen the asset record an inflow of $3 billion. While BTC‚Äôs price and market cap suffered a bloodbath, its trading volume was negatively impacted. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Spot ETF: Will BTC Mimic Gold‚Äôs 2004 Price Surge? Analyst Weighs In Bitcoin has seen its trading volume fall from a high of $14 billion last Wednesday to as low as $3.5 billion yesterday and $8 billion in the past 24 hours.

42392643,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg93wx,1694127681,"CFTC Goes After Opyn, Other DeFi Operations in Enforcement Sweep","The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has charged three decentralized finance (DeFi) operations ‚Äì Opyn, Inc., ZeroEx (0x), Inc. and Deridex, Inc. ‚Äì with offering illegal derivatives trading, according to a Thursday statement from the agency.  The three firms face a number of accusations based on their use of blockchain-based protocols and smart contracts to function as trading platforms, according to the CFTC. The U.S. derivatives regulator is ordering Opyn, ZeroEx, and Deridex to cease those violations and pay penalties of $250,000, $200,000, and $100,000, respectively. The companies agreed to these terms to settle the charges.  ‚ÄúSomewhere along the way, DeFi operators got the idea that unlawful transactions become lawful when facilitated by smart contracts,‚Äù said CFTC Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. ‚ÄúThey do not.‚Äù  But the CFTC may have been especially familiar with 0x, because it hired an acting director of LabCFTC from 0x Labs. Jason Somensatto took over the agency's financial technology research division in 2021. He's now head of policy in North America for Chainalysis.  All three companies are accused of illegally offering leveraged and margined retail commodity transactions using digital assets, the CFTC said.  Opyn, a DeFi marketplace associated with the token oSQTH, is a California-based company that the CFTC also accused of failing to properly register as a swap execution facility, a designated contract market and a futures commission merchant, and also failing to set up a customer identification program to meet Bank Secrecy Act requirements. Deridex, a North Carolina company, was also accused of those additional violations.  Those companies and ZeroEx, known for its 0x protocol, were all said by the CFTC to have cooperated in the investigation, getting a reduced financial penalty as a result.  Representatives of Opyn and 0x didn't immediately respond to requests for comment, and CoinDesk couldn't locate a representative for Deridex. An account associated with 0x app Matcha posted Thursday on X, formerly known as Twitter, that ""both 0x and Matcha continue to operate with no problem.""  One CFTC commissioner dissented in the enforcement vote.  ""The Commission‚Äôs Orders in these cases give no indication that customer funds have been misappropriated or that any market participants have been victimized by the DeFi protocols on which the Commission has unleashed its enforcement powers,"" said Commissioner Summer Mersinger in a statement. ""I am concerned that the Commission in these cases is taking another step down the path of bringing enforcement actions when we should be engaging with the public.""

The refund aims to compensate users affected by a price discrepancy on listed CYBER tokens due to liquidity constraints on the Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit. Related Reading: Make Or Break: Bitcoin Fate Hangs On The Edge Of The 200-Week EMA Binance Addresses CyberConnect Woes As described by Binance, the incident unfolded when a liquidity crunch on CYBER cross-chain bridges hindered transactions on Upbit. This led to a price disparity between Upbit and other exchanges, attracting arbitrageurs who borrowed CYBER from Binance to profit from the price difference. Consequently, Binance users who had staked CYBER in its Flexible Earn Program could not redeem their assets since the staked tokens had been borrowed, reaching the loan limit. In response to the situation, Binance acknowledged users‚Äô feedback and sincerely apologized for the inconvenience caused. The exchange affirmed its commitment to prioritizing users‚Äô interests and maintaining high transparency within the community. Binance provided a detailed account of the events leading to the incident. It explained that the liquidity crunch on CYBER (ERC20) tokens resulted in a surge of loan requests for CYBER, triggering Binance‚Äôs risk management protocol. The exchange had to halt new loan requests and increase loan interest rates significantly. However, due to the substantial volume of redemption requests, Binance faced challenges in fulfilling them immediately despite maintaining a maximum borrowing limit as a buffer for redemptions. Stricter Reviews And Potential Delistings Moving forward, Binance outlined measures to enhance user experience and mitigate similar risks. These measures include dynamically adjusting loan interest rates and strengthening risk management protocols. According to their September 7 announcement, Binance also committed to conducting stricter reviews of tokens with smaller market caps and potentially delisting tokens with lower liquidity from certain programs. To compensate affected users, Binance announced a distribution plan for the $1 million USDT refund. It stated that 887 impacted users who failed to redeem their CYBER Simple Earn Flexible Products positions within a specific timeframe would receive a share of USDT tokens from the refund pool and additional CYBER tokens. The distribution would be proportionate to the daily average positions of the eligible users. All other users who held CYBER Simple Earn Flexible Products positions during the mentioned period would receive an equal share of CYBER Locked Trial Fund vouchers sponsored by the CyberConnect Foundation.

In a statement released Wednesday, the FBI said Lazarus Group stole $41 million in various cryptocurrencies from Stake.com. It warned the public about the continuing threat that state sponsored hackers ‚Äì from the hermit kingdom in particular ‚Äì pose to the entire crypto industry.  The Lazarus Group, also known as APT38, has been linked to hundreds of millions of dollars in stolen crypto with attacks on companies, exchanges, DeFi protocols and bridges. It‚Äôs a massive operation that U.S. authorities and even the United Nations claim funds North Korea‚Äôs nuclear weapons program.  In the case of Stake.com, the sophisticated hack from Lazarus group appeared to involve a private key to a hot wallet being leaked or otherwise stolen ‚Äì as opposed to a bug in a smart contract. The hackers have funds on the Ethereum, BSC, Polygon and Bitcoin blockchains.  Lazarus group had already been a prime suspect for this latest loss of crypto.

42392625,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg92n9,1694121402,Tokenization News Roundup: the 'Next Trillion',"The idea of tokenizing real-world assets ‚Äì everything from homes, gold, art and collectibles to instruments like U.S. Treasuries and contracts ‚Äì is gaining pace. Each week, we‚Äôll be rounding up the most important news, offering you a snapshot of developments in this burgeoning space. (For an explainer on real-world assets, please see our article here.)  Tokenization Advocacy Group Wants to Bring the 'Next Trillion' of Assets to Blockchain ‚Äì CoinDesk  The Story: Crypto industry heavyweights including Coinbase, Circle and Aave have built a working group to encourage others to bring traditional financial assets on-chain. The Tokenized Asset Coalition aims to bring the ‚Äúnext trillion dollars of assets‚Äù into crypto through education and advocacy for tokenization, targeting both the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and TradFi.  The Takeaway: While advocacy groups are not new to crypto, it is somewhat unusual to see an organization sprouting up to champion a specific sector. But the Tokenized Asset Coalition scores points for working with corporate entities, DeFi incumbents and relative newcomers to tokenization, which may help them win over crypto natives who have not always been open to the vector attacks that real world assets may bring. Of course, banks almost need no convincing: the Boston Consulting Group recently found tokenized assets could hit $16 trillion by 2030.  $500B Korean Asset Manager Mirae Taps Polygon Labs in Securities Tokenization Drive ‚Äì CoinDesk  The Story: South Korea's largest financial group Mirae Asset Securities is working with Ethereum scaling platform Polygon Labs to build RWA infrastructure. In particular, Polygon will act as a technical consultant for the recently founded Mirae Asset Security Token Working Group, which includes several other crypto and non-crypto companies working to build tools to issue, exchange and distribute tokenized securities.  See also: Emerging Market Crypto Policy Should Be Regulation, Not Bans, BIS Says  The Takeaway: Tokenization is no doubt a cross-chain phenomenon, but a few blockchains including Polygon are emerging as early leads. For instance, the Monetary Authority of Singapore is using Polygon for its experimental tokenization initiative Project Guardian, as is top tier asset manager Franklin Templeton for its blockchain financial products.  LSE Group Plans to Offer Blockchain-Powered Market for Traditional Assets ‚Äì CoinDesk  The Story: The London Stock Exchange Group, the operator of one of the oldest stock exchanges in the world, has drawn up plans to offer blockchain-based versions of traditional financial assets. Though it isn‚Äôt interested in cryptocurrency per se, it has gotten religion over the benefits of tokenizing assets. The company is now considering spinning up a new digital assets unit for the blockchain-based markets business and is in talks with regulators across the U.K. government.  The Takeaway: LSE Group's Head of Capital Markets Murray Ross told the Financial Times the company hit an ‚Äúinflection point‚Äù after studying blockchain and found that ‚Äúdigital technology‚Äù can make trading ‚Äúslicker, smoother, cheaper and more transparent.‚Äù It‚Äôs just the latest stock exchange to realize how tokenizing securities on-chain can improve performance for everyone. (Though interestingly, this week, the World Federation of Exchanges trade association published results from a survey of stock exchanges conducted before FTX imploded, and found that more than half were already offering or had planned to offer crypto-related products or services.)  Swift, Chainlink Tokenization Experiment Successfully Transfers Value Across Multiple Blockchains ‚Äì CoinDesk  The Story: Chainlink‚Äôs initial experiments with interbank messaging system Swift have been successful, according to an Aug. 31 press release. The two firms, in conjunction 12 financial partners including BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon, The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation and Lloyds Banking Group, successfully transferred tokenized value across multiple private and public blockchains using Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol.  The Takeaway: Banks in particular are increasingly interested in tokenization, and having the interbank communications standard, Swift, already engaged in pilot programs is affirmative. ""For tokenization to reach its potential, institutions will need to be able to seamlessly connect with the whole financial ecosystem. Our experiments have demonstrated clearly that existing secure and trusted Swift infrastructure can provide that central point of connectivity, removing a huge hurdle in the development of tokenization and unlocking its potential,"" Tom Zschach, chief innovation officer at Swift said in a press statement.  Visa Taps Solana and USDC Stablecoin to Boost Cross-Border Payments ‚Äì CoinDesk  The Story: Visa is expanding its use of the USDC stablecoin to Solana to speed up certain types of cross-border payments, but its announcement revealed how fully integrated crypto is into Visa‚Äôs stack. The payments giant has used the Circle-issued stablecoin on Ethereum since a pilot program in 2021 for treasury management purposes. It is also piloting global debit and credit card payments programs with merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei, an interesting new use case tethering blockchain to the real world.  The Takeaway: Visa, which claims to be one of the first major financial firms to tap Solana, is ‚Äúleveraging stablecoins‚Äù to provide a ‚Äúmodern option‚Äù for clients to move money around, Cuy Sheffield, head of crypto at Visa, said in a statement. The cool thing is these funds are starting in Visa‚Äôs treasury, meaning they‚Äôre fully onboarded into the crypto economy. The stablecoin market can potentially grow to $2.8 trillion in the next five years as global financial and consumer platforms tap the tokens on public blockchains to power value exchange on their platforms, research firm Bernstein has said.  SOMA Finance to Issue the First Retail Compliant Digital Security ‚Äì CoinDesk  The Story: SOMA Finance, a decentralized exchange, is planning to raise $5 million through the ‚Äúfirst legally issued‚Äù digital security token sale to global and U.S. retail investors later this month. Interestingly, the SOMA token will pay out dividends from the protocol‚Äôs trading revenues, meaning it represents an actual claim on the business ‚Äî or in the words of the press release the token will be ""a non-cumulative, participating preferred stock"" of SOMA.finance. The sale will be conducted using a regulated crowdfunding model called Reg CF.  See also: Back to School: Supporting the Next Generation of Investors  The Takeaway: Regulated token sales have had their time in the sun in the past, like Reg A's brush with popularity before companies realized it was largely a dead end. SOMA's token offers real utility in the sense of delivering cash flows, which may give it a leg up. And is essentially an attempt to tokenize a company's operations. Also of note: SOMA is a joint venture between MANTRA and Tritaurian Capital, the latter of which is a registered broker-dealer, member of the Financial Industry Reporting Authority (FINRA) and first non-alternative trading system (ATS) broker-dealer to be approved for a license to sell digital private placement securities using blockchain technology.  Rabobank, ABN Amro in deposit token project in EU Blockchain Sandbox ‚Äì Ledger Insights  The Story: A consortium including crypto firms 2Tokens and Assetblocks as well as Dutch banks Rabobank and ABN Amro has been selected as one of the first 20 participating projects in the European Blockchain Sandbox, with a plan to build euro-denominated deposit tokens and blockchain wallets. Ledger Insights reports: ""The tokenization will use Assetblocks‚Äô solution to represent a tracking stock backed by renewable energy sources. Investors will buy NFTs representing a partial ownership interest in solar, wind and battery parks, which entitles them to receive profits. As a security, the NFT falls under MiFID II regulations.""  The Takeaway: The pilot program is looking into different settlement options for tokenized assets like its energy shares, and is reportedly considering trialing ""whitelisted wallets"" at the participating banks as well as stablecoins. ABN Amro is no stranger to blockchain, and even assisted in a tokenized bond issuance this year, but it does seem notable for financial firms to be interested in this alternative use of tokenization. Assetblocks CEO Meindert Jansberg said it best in the press release: ‚ÄúBy collaborating with ABN AMRO and Rabobank in this regulatory sandbox, the project aims to help create a common understanding of the true possibilities of tokenization in a fully compliant way.‚Äù",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/09/07/tokenization-news-roundup-the-next-trillion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/677999a6aa0f0e300eeaed71fdeebfba21ed830d-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

17274882,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550437,1694118616,"Cardano Announces Warp Transactions, ADA Remains Stuck In Ranging Market","Strica, a company working on solutions and use cases for the Cardano blockchain, unveiled a new feature for the smart contract platform via their wallet, Warp Transactions. According to an official press release, described as a ‚Äúgame changer for token transfers,‚Äù Warp Transactions were created to ease the burden of transaction fees paid when sending assets on this network. Related Reading: Cardano HODLing: Long-Term Holders See 170% Rise In Past Year Cardano New Feature Eliminates Sender Fees, But There Is A Clause Usually, on Cardano, every token transfer demands the sender to pay a minimum fee of 1.14 ADA to secure against network attacks. However, the Warp Transaction now offers an alternative for this mechanism. Warp Transactions are based on the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model. UTXOs refer to the small amount of digital currency after one executes a transaction. Now, Warp Transactions are considered a type of UTXO transaction. They use the receiver address‚Äôs UTXOs to cover the minimum ADA fee required to process transactions on the Cardano network. However, there is a clause that this new feature employs a multi-signature function. Therefore, the receiver and sender must sign off for any transaction to be completed and published on the blockchain. Furthermore, while Warp Transactions may mark a new era for the ADA community, this feature is only available for users of the Typhon Wallet. Whenever a Warp Transaction is initiated, the receiving address is notified and given 24 hours to accept or reject the transaction. During this period, the tokens are moved from the sender‚Äôs wallet and are locked in a mempool, which acts as a ‚Äúholding area‚Äù till the receiver approves or cancels the transaction. This mempool is managed by the backend of the Typhon Wallet. Related Reading: Analyst Calls ADA Amazon Of The Crypto World, Forecasts Bright Future Ahead ADA Struggles For Market Breakout In other news, ADA, native token of the Cardano network, has been moving sideways over the last few days.

42392638,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg93cR,1694114311,"Reject CBDCs, Embrace the Right to Transact","We are all slowly losing something we barely noticed we had: the right to transact. A couple decades ago, it was inconceivable that an overbearing government would freeze payments as a means of social control. Today, a system of pervasive censorship of transactions is emerging to complement pervasive censorship of speech.  Zelinar XY, aka ZXY, is a writer, software developer and greengrocer. He's the author of ""The Right to Transact,"" available on Amazon. You can follow him on Twitter or email him at zelinarxy [at] proton [dot] me.  States have long used economic censorship or sanction as a means of quashing dissent. So is it much of a surprise governments today would abuse the new affordances of digital technology, which expands the reach of data collection, surveillance and asset seizure? Early last year, for instance, the Canadian government declared a state of emergency and ordered banks to freeze the assets of anti-lockdown protesters.  See also: Who Really Benefits From CBDCs? It's Not the Public | Opinion  Soon, because of the steady creep of payments digitization, governments will be able to carry out such interventions routinely ‚Äì no need to break the glass and invoke emergency powers or enlist the aid of docile private-sector banks.  Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), which are in various stages of development across the world, will incorporate the ability to freeze or confiscate funds into money itself. With the kind of programmable money envisioned by CBDC advocates, the state may be able to bar you from using your national currency at all, regardless of what bank or payments provider you choose to do business with. You'll no longer only run the risk that some company will mistreat you.  This may not happen, and indeed several central banks have said that they don‚Äôt want complete control over the ways users interface with their money. But the simple fact is that CBDCs open the door to that level of control, and it‚Äôs likely that many of the social policy aims behind CBDCs ‚Äì like improving tax collection and fighting financial crime ‚Äì would be next to impossible without a complete CBDC takeover.  Commercial banks, who would lose revenues if governments got involved in personal banking, would certainly put up a fuss. But either way, large numbers of people will end up using CBDCs, at least some exclusively, and if central bankers' own words are any guide, users are in for dismal treatment: locked funds and routine surveillance, arbitrary rules built into the currency courtesy of ""programmability features"" and universal KYC utilizing iris scans and fingerprints.  And code speaks louder than words. Brazil's central bank has released documentation and software related to a pilot CBDC that gives the government the ability to freeze any user's balance, ""move"" any user's balance to another account or even ""pause"" the entire currency.  See also: If Money Is Speech, CBDCs Should Be Tools for Freedom | Opinion  The justification for this radical update to the basic nature of money is that Bad People can use money to do Bad Things: tax evasion, money laundering and other unspecified ""illicit activities."" Fine. But we don't yet call for every single car to be tracked mile-by-mile by some centralized government agency, despite cars' being optimal tools for drug, weapons and human trafficking.  We must reject a program of total surveillance and control over currency in the name of stultifying, totalitarian safety. Central bankers are economists. What qualifies them to interpret and enforce law? What ""illicit activity"" exactly will they have jurisdiction over? Will they wait for the justice system for instruction before using their god-like bureaucratic powers or simply act?  Will they enforce laws (statutes passed by representatives we can vote out of office) or will they enforce ""policies"" written down by unaccountable bureaucrats?  We should brace for the worst.  Or, we can recognize and defend the right to transact. It's one we na√Øvely enjoyed from deepest antiquity into living memory. If our declining institutions want to take away this natural right, let them state their case. It will certainly be incoherent.  Nothing otherwise illegal is somehow rendered lawful by the right for people to transact freely: bad behavior is still policed, but not through arbitrary, centralized control over the means of exchange itself. And of course, we need to pursue the one practical route available to us to counteract the slide into financial panopticon: adopt and use cryptocurrency.  The Canadian government, as sometimes happens, believed its own propaganda when it ordered self-custodied bitcoin wallet developers to freeze their users' funds. That government now understands, as the world is beginning to, that this is impossible: cryptocurrency protects the right to transact.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Zelinar XY,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/07/reject-cbdcs-embrace-the-right-to-transact,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d1bd4f3720bb28677a9ef09326821cd54d073e10-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42392627,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg92i1,1694114260,Ex-FTX Executive Ryan Salame Could Forfeit $1.5B as Part of Guilty Plea,"NEW YORK ‚Äî Ryan Salame, a top FTX executive who played a key role in the exchange‚Äôs political fundraising operations, could forfeit over $1.5 billion after pleading guilty on Thursday to federal criminal charges tied to the exchange.  Salame, who was co-CEO of FTX's Bahamas entity, FTX Digital Markets, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to make unlawful contributions and defraud the Federal Election Commission, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transferring business.  ‚ÄúI made political contributions in my name that were funded by transfers from an Alameda subsidiary,‚Äù Salame told Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is also overseeing Bankman-Fried's trial, as he entered his guilty plea. Alameda Research was a trading firm established by Bankman-Fried which allegedly invested funds belonging to FTX exchange users.  The Alameda transfers were ‚Äúcategorized as loans,‚Äù Salame said, but ‚Äúit was understood that they would not be repaid.‚Äù The donations, according to Salame, ‚Äúwere for the benefit of initiatives introduced by others but supported by Sam Bankman-Fried.‚Äù  As part of his plea agreement with the government, Salame could ultimately forfeit more than $1.5 billion dollars. He agreed to hand over $6 million before his sentencing, scheduled for March of next year. To help cover this amount, Salame has already agreed to give the government a ‚Äú2021 Porsche automobile‚Äù and multiple properties, including two Massachusetts homes and ownership of the East Rood Farm Corporation, an entity Salame owns. Based on federal sentencing guidelines, Salame could face up to 10 years in prison.  Should Salame pay the $6 million and turn over the various properties by the set deadlines ‚Äì referred to as the substitute assets ‚Äì he will be off the hook for the full amount, a DOJ filing said. ""Upon receipt of the payment ... the [U.S.] shall accept the Payment and Substitute Assets in full satisfaction of the Money Judgement,"" the filing said.  The DOJ could still pursue the full $1.5 billion if it turns out that Salame lied in a financial affidavit or if he otherwise interferes with the government's attempt to deal with the assets, the document said.  Additionally, Salame was ordered to pay more than $5.5 million in restitution to FTX debtors.  According to a different DOJ document, the $1.5 billion Salame will forfeit represents ""property involved in"" the unlicensed money transmitter charge.  The guilty plea comes less than a month before the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the FTX founder, is set to begin. Bankman-Fried, who has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges against him, stands accused of orchestrating a multibillion-dollar fraud that ultimately culminated in FTX‚Äôs bankruptcy and the loss of funds for its customers.  Salame, a Republican megadonor, says now that he served as a secret go-between for FTX donations to right-wing politicians and political causes.  ‚ÄúRyan Salame agreed to advance the interests of FTX, Alameda Research, and his co-conspirators through an unlawful political influence campaign and through an unlicensed money transmitting business, which helped FTX grow faster and larger by operating outside of the law,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement.  Salame was arraigned on Thursday at the U.S. Courthouse in the Southern District of New York. Bloomberg first reported that Salame was expected to plead guilty on Thursday morning. After appearing in court clad in a blue suit and wearing socks emblazoned with Bitcoin logos, Salame was released on a $1 million bond with two co-signers.  Other former leaders of the FTX exchange empire ‚Äì Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh ‚Äì have already pleaded guilty to criminal charges. All are expected to serve as witnesses for the government‚Äôs case against Bankman-Fried, who prosecutors say conducted one of the largest financial crimes in U.S. history. Prosecutors had previously said that Salame intended to plead his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and so wouldn't testify.  Salame‚Äôs Role at FTX  In its original indictment against Sam Bankman-Fried, which listed Salame as an unnamed co-conspirator, the U.S. Department of Justice charged Bankman-Fried with using a straw donor scheme to secretly make political donations in violation of campaign finance laws.  As Bankman-Fried publicly branded himself as an ardent supporter of the Democratic party ‚Äì he made the second-largest single donation to Joe Biden‚Äôs 2020 presidential campaign, and he and his family were active in a variety of left-leaning political causes ‚Äì he allegedly used Salame to covertly court Republicans.  Salame doled out more than $24 million to Republican political candidates during his time at FTX, and he was the 11th largest individual U.S. political donor in 2022 according to OpenSecrets.org. In a court filing last month, prosecutors shared ‚Äúprivate messages‚Äù from Salame that purport to show him explaining how he was used as a straw donor to secretly funnel money from FTX and Bankman-Fried.  ‚ÄúIn a private message to a trusted family member in November 2021, Salame explained that the defendant ‚Äòwant[ed] to donate to both democtratic [sic] and republican candidates in the US,‚Äô but the defendant would not do so ‚Äòcause the worlds frankly lost its mind if you dontate [sic] to a democrat no republicans will speak to you and if you donate to a republican then no democrats will speak to you,‚Äô‚Äù the filing said.  The DOJ dropped its campaign finance charge against Sam Bankman-Fried in July ‚Äì due to treaty obligations with the Bahamas ‚Äì but it later clarified that the FTX founder would still be ‚Äúcharged with conducting an illegal campaign finance scheme.‚Äù The campaign finance allegations will now be lumped in with wire fraud charges from the original indictment, prosecutors said in a letter addressed to Judge Kaplan.  Separate from the Bankman-Fried case, federal prosecutors are reportedly investigating if Salame and his girlfriend, Michelle Bond, broke campaign finance laws in connection to Bond‚Äôs unsuccessful 2022 congressional bid, according to the Wall Street Journal.  Elizabeth Napolitano contributed reporting.  UPDATE (Sept. 7, 2023, 20:20 UTC): Adds additional detail from hearing.  UPDATE (Sept. 7, 2023, 21:05 UTC): Adds detail from DOJ filing.

17270882,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550421,1694113244,Polygon Foundation Refutes Claims Of Dumping MATIC On Binance ‚Äì Here‚Äôs What Happened,"Blockchain analytics site Lookonchain flagged recent transactions of two on-chain addresses allegedly owned by the Polygon Foundation. The platform reported that one of these wallet addresses had transferred large amounts of MATIC ‚Äì the Polygon network‚Äôs native token ‚Äì to Binance in the past two days. According to Lookonchain, the two addresses, tagged as ‚ÄúPolygon Foundation: 0x8d36‚Äù and ‚ÄúPolygon Foundation: 0xf957,‚Äù have collectively transferred nearly $6 million worth of MATIC to Binance over the past month, with more than half of the amount deposited onto the exchange in the last two days. Polygon Labs Founder Denies Dumping MATIC Tokens In an X post, Polygon Labs founder Sandeep Nailwal swiftly refuted the suggestions that the Polygon Foundation may be dumping MATIC tokens on Binance. The founder asserted it was ‚Äúanother‚Äù case of incorrectly labeling wallet addresses. Related Reading: Korean Finance Giant Partners With Polygon Labs, Can It Push MATIC Above $1? Nailwal emphasized the need to exercise caution before publishing claims of this nature, as they can create FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) in the crypto community. For context, FUD refers to the spread of negative ‚Äì and sometimes false ‚Äì information about a cryptocurrency or the general market to create fear and doubt among investors and potentially influence prices. It is worth mentioning that the founder‚Äôs claims align with the words of Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron, who was the first to raise this issue of wallet mislabeling. Boiron had also insisted that the Polygon Foundation controls none of the addresses. In response to Boiron, Lookonchain stated that the crypto intelligence platform Nansen conducted the address labeling. Wallet Addresses Are Strongly Linked To Polygon Foundation, Nansen Reiterates Nansen responded to the situation, explaining why the two wallets were linked to the Polygon Foundation. Meanwhile, the analytics firm put in a robust defense for its address labeling system, claiming that every label undergoes a ‚Äúrigorous documentation process.‚Äù Going further in its explanation, Nansen cited some instances where prominent figures at Polygon Labs interacted with the ‚ÄúPolygon Foundation: 0x8d36‚Äù address. In one example, Polygon‚Äôs head of growth, Sanket Shah, reportedly sent ETH to the address for ‚Äúgas purposes.‚Äù Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could See Lift-off Unless This Support Gives Way For the second address, ‚ÄúPolygon Foundation: 0xf957‚Äù, Nansen said its counterparties consist of the first address and other entities closely associated with Polygon, including the head of investments, Shreyansh Singh. Nansen concluded that: The evidence for both of these addresses shows a very strong link to various individuals and entities of the Polygon Foundation, and that‚Äôs why we labeled these addresses as part of the Polygon Foundation. Despite this, Nansen claims to have removed the labels ‚Äúas a gesture of goodwill‚Äù since the Polygon Labs CEO openly denied links to the two addresses.

ParaFi Capital, Framework Ventures and 1kx had accused Egorov of engaging in a ‚Äúbrazen‚Äù scheme to defraud them, according to the lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of California in San Francisco. The complaint alleged that Egorov misappropriated trade secrets of the three VC firms and defrauded the firms out of close to $1 million in funds while dangling the false promise of a possible stake in Curve to gain the investors‚Äô trust and support.  But Judge Richard B. Ulmer Jr., in an order posted Wednesday, said Egorov hasn‚Äôt lived in California since 2018, but the behavior the plaintiffs cited took place in 2020, meaning a California courtroom is the wrong venue.  The three VC firms have been pursuing a breach-of-contract case in Switzerland against Egorov and his company Swiss Stake since 2020, and have also alleged that Egorov moved to Switzerland to insulate himself from inevitable legal fallout.  Curve is a decentralized exchange built on the Ethereum blockchain and ranks among the biggest DeFi trading platforms, with some $4.07 billion in total locked value, according to DefiLlama.

The recent drop in Bitcoin's price has been attributed to various factors, including economic data from China and the Binance saga. Overall, the sector still is in a bear market. Technical analysis suggests that Bitcoin's weekly and daily charts are bearish, and sentiment in the crypto sector is slightly fearful. Overall, September tends to be very negative for Bitcoin. Between early January and mid of July, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) as well as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) had outperformed all other asset classes. Over the last seven weeks, however, the largest and most dominant cryptocurrency is down more than 18%. In hindsight, our analysis from July 15th was way too optimistic. Review With prices topping out at USD 31,818 on July 13th, Bitcoin had achieved its highest level since June 1st, 2022. However, this level could only be maintained for two days before prices swiftly descended again. Bitcoin then traded in a sideways range for nearly five weeks, roughly between USD 30,500 and USD 29,000 USD. Bitcoin in USD, 4-hour chart as of September 3rd, 2023. (TradingView) In the midst of peak summer season, breaching the USD 29,000 support on August 17th triggered a sharp decline. Prices quickly plummeted to USD 26,100, with some crypto exchanges briefly seeing even lower prices around USD 24,700 USD. According to Coinglass, this crash forced the liquidation of long positions worth over USD 820 million within a few hours! Bitcoin ‚Äì Emotional rollercoaster at critical support Over the following 11 trading days, Bitcoin remained in a state of shock, moving in a narrow range just above USD 26,000. Almost out of nowhere, the landmark decision of a U.S. court regarding the unlawful rejection of Grayscale Investments‚Äô application for a publicly traded Bitcoin Spot ETF reignited Bitcoin last Tuesday. Prices surged to nearly USD 28,200 within a few hours and immediately unleashed big enthusiasm among perma crypto bulls. However, this recovery was very short-lived as Bitcoin quickly relinquished all its gains over the following two trading days, returning to its tight trading range around USD 26,000. From a sober perspective, this emotional rollercoaster at the critical support of USD 26,000 does not bode well regarding price action in the short-term future. Whether the dismal economic data from China, the most aggressive interest rate hike cycle in the U.S. ever, the Binance saga, or simply a larger bear market is to blame for the price decline remains open to interpretation. In any case, Bitcoin has been losing momentum since mid-July. Trading volume has also been significantly declining since many weeks. Furthermore, the last attempt to break above USD 30,000 USD on August 8th failed miserably. As a result, the sell signals accumulated, requiring very little to trigger a cascade of stop-loss orders and liquidations. BNB (Binance Smart Chain) in USD, weekly chart as of September 3rd, 2023. (TradingView) However, the ‚ÄúBinance problem‚Äù has not been resolved by the ongoing pullback. On the contrary, the once-largest and most successful crypto exchange has been struggling for months. The FTX collapse and the bear market since late 2021 have taken a toll on Binance. Since being sued by the SEC for lacking trading licenses, the situation has been progressively worsening, with its own blockchain, ‚ÄúBinance Smart Chain,‚Äù and the BNB token ( BNB-USD ) coming under severe pressure. The market capitalization of BNB is still around USD 33 billion, but the token price has recently fallen sharply and is hanging around the critical support zone at USD 210 USD. Below that, there is essentially a void down to approximately USD 40. In retrospect, the excitement surrounding the potential spot ETF from the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, BlackRock, was short-lived. While BlackRock‚Äôs application in mid-June led to a rapid 26.6% increase, most of those gains have since been erased. However, the ‚ÄúBitcoin Spot ETF‚Äù topic is not off the table and should generate excitement again, no later than the first quarter of 2024. Technical analysis for Bitcoin in US-Dollar Bitcoin Weekly Chart ‚Äì The recovery rally since January is now undergoing a correction. Bitcoin in USD, weekly chart as of September 3rd, 2023. (TradingView) While Bitcoin reached a higher high of USD 31,818 USD in mid-July, further price gains remained elusive. The well-known resistance zone just above the round USD 31,000 mark proved to be too strong. With the sharp sell-off and failed recovery, the picture has now definitively changed, and we must assume that the recovery rally that began in early January is now being fully corrected. The upward trendline in place since the beginning of the year was easily overrun by the bears. Even the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement (USD 25,577 USD) was briefly breached. The classic 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement (USD 21,720) along with the uptrend channel are currently waiting around USD 21,750. Although the Stochastic Oscillator has reached its oversold zone, there is no sign of any trend reversal so far. In summary, the weekly chart is bearish and suggests further selling towards approximately USD 22,000. Bitcoin Daily Chart ‚Äì When will the 38.2% retracement be breached? Bitcoin in USD, daily chart as of September 3rd, 2023. (TradingView) Our expectation of a breakout to the upside was clearly wrong in mid-July. With USD 31,818, only a slightly higher high was achieved. And instead of further rising prices, Bitcoin sold off hard in the last six weeks. Without any resistance whatsoever the 200-MA (USD 27,543) was clearly breached. The bounce back to this moving average also failed during this week, activating another selling signal on the Stochastic oscillator. Hence, in the worst case, Bitcoin may target the 61.8% retracement at USD 21,720 USD in the coming weeks. Overall, the daily chart is bearish, and supports are relatively scarce until around USD 22,000 USD. At best, the mid-June low around USD 24,750 could slow down the bears. Sentiment Bitcoin ‚Äì Sentiment is slightly fearful. Crypto Fear & Greed Index long term, as of September 3rd, 2023. (Lookintobitcoin) The ‚ÄúCrypto Fear & Greed Index‚Äù is currently at 40 out of 100 points. Therefore, the sentiment in the crypto sector is slightly fearful. In the bigger picture, sentiment has significantly recovered over the past nine months since the panic low in November 2022. However, the extreme euphoria from 2021 has by no means been reached. At the same time, the recent drop in sentiment has not yet lead to extreme fear and panic nor signaling a decisive end of the sentiment recovery. In total, sentiment is neutral to slightly fearful and therefore not giving us a clear indication or any contrarian signal. Seasonality Bitcoin ‚Äì Very unfavorable until mid-October Seasonality for Bitcoin, as of August 30th, 2023. (Seasonax) The seasonal pattern for Bitcoin has been quite negative since mid-June and is expected to remain so until mid-October. Bitcoin typically experiences weakness, especially in September, before a bottoming process usually begins in October. Whether this pattern will hold true this year is, of course, uncertain. In any case, the statistics for the upcoming weeks advise caution and restraint. In summary, seasonal cycle for Bitcoin is extremely unfavorable and clearly negative until mid-October. Sound money: Bitcoin vs. Gold Bitcoin/Gold-Ratio, weekly chart as of September 3rd, 2023. (TradingView) The strong US dollar has put pressure on gold and Bitcoin since mid-July. While the price of gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) has been recovering significantly from its low around USD 1,885 USD over the last two weeks, Bitcoin remains under pressure. With Bitcoin trading at around USD 26,000 USD and gold at USD 1,940, one currently needs about 13.4 ounces of gold to buy one Bitcoin. Conversely, one ounce of gold currently costs approximately 0.0746 Bitcoin. Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin (+54.76%) is still the best performer since the beginning of the year, outperforming the price of gold (+5.45%) by a factor of 10! Looking back, the Bitcoin/Gold-ratio reached its highest level in 13 months on July 6th, with values around 16.5. Since then, the ratio has retraced around 38.2% back to 13.6. As long as this low is not breached, the uptrend since the beginning of the year remains intact. On the upside, the ratio would need to break above the downtrend-line of the past few weeks, at around 15, to continue this uptrend. Overall, it seems more likely to see lower ratio values or, at best, a consolidation between the broad support zone (12.5 to 14.5) and the broad resistance zone (16 to 18.5). Macro update ‚Äì The ‚Äúoath of revelation‚Äù by central bankers will come sooner or later! U.S. unemployment rate, as of August 31st, 2023. (Holger Zsch√§pitz) The US labor market continues to slow down. According to the latest US labor market report, the unemployment rate surged to 3.8% in August. At the same time, the number of non-farm payrolls increased by 187,000, slightly more than expected. As usual, job gains for the previous months of June and July were significantly revised downward, a well-known game played by government statisticians that increasingly questions the credibility of these labor market reports. Overall, it is likely to be challenging for the Federal Reserve ((FED)) to further raise interest rates. Although the US central bank has had some success in combating the high inflation with its aggressive rate hikes, the official inflation rate in the US is still at 3.2%, which is considered too high. Unlike China and Germany, the US economy has shown some resilience to the withdrawal of cheap money so far. However, the effects of restrictive monetary policy typically take hold with a significant delay of about 12 to 20 months. Distress within the US commercial real estate sector is steadily increasing Distress levels in U.S. commercial real estate, as of April 30th, 2023. (MSCI) While the US real estate market, like in Germany, has largely entered a state of shock due to high interest rates, disruptions in the US commercial real estate sector continue to grow. According to real estate research firm Green Street, prices for American office and commercial properties have already fallen on average by 16% since their peak in March 2022. Unlike the 2008 financial crisis, when a lack of credit affected the value of all properties, the current downturn has hit some sectors of real estate much harder than others. While foreclosures are still relatively rare, the total value of US properties in distress, in default, or already under special servicing reached nearly USD 72 billion already by end of April and is likely to have increased significantly since then. Including vulnerable properties, the pool of potentially troubled assets is more than twice as high. KBW Bank Index down 8.78% in August KBW Nasdaq Bank Index as of August 31st, 2023. (Holger Zschaepitz) For US regional banks, these commercial properties pose a significant risk because their exposure is dramatically higher than that of Wall Street‚Äôs big banks. Nevertheless, five months after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, the KBW Bank Index ( KBWB ) fell significantly in August. The worst-performing bank stock was Citigroup, with a -13.4% decline. Given this situation, a recession or a hard landing for the global economy is the logical consequence. However, it is challenging to predict exactly when the ‚Äúoath of revelation‚Äù by the central bankers will come. Most likely, it will be within the next six months but they will do everything to package the message the truth unrecognizable. The necessary amount of new liquidity that will be required to save the system again will surpass anything seen before and not only catapult precious metal prices to new heights but also breathe new life into Bitcoin. However, as long as at least one of the proposed Bitcoin spot ETFs is not approved, Bitcoin is likely to remain under pressure or weak. A second support level in the range of USD 15,000 to USD 20,000 is possible before the next halving in April 2024 could create a supply shock. Conclusion: Bitcoin ‚Äì Emotional rollercoaster at critical support With its rise of over 100% within around six months, Bitcoin once again outperformed all other asset classes. However, in the last six weeks, the situation has significantly deteriorated since reaching its yearly high at USD 31,818, as numerous sell signals have emerged. As a result, the recovery since the November low appears quite modest considering the huge declines from the all-time high at USD 69,000 USD. The 38.2% retracement at USD 35,924 has not been reached so far, which is disappointing and a sign of weakness. With the breach of support around USD 29,000 and the clear drop below the 200-day moving average (USD 27,542), Bitcoin is now trading in the lower half of its uptrend channel. The critical support at USD 26,000 is increasingly weakening. Be very patient & cautious over the next six weeks Considering the statistically unfavorable September weeks, we should anticipate a continuation of the correction towards USD 24,500 and USD 22,000 USD. At the lower edge of the uptrend channel, we may see a bottoming process and the beginning of a recovery around mid-October.",NEGATIVE,BTC | BNB,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4633747-bitcoin-emotional-rollercoaster-at-critical-support-technical-analysis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/17268556.jpeg

17267523,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550422,1694108770,Make Or Break: Bitcoin Fate Hangs On The Edge Of The 200-Week EMA,"Bitcoin (BTC) has officially dipped below the $26,000 level and is currently trading at $25,800, which coincides with its 200-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This EMA has served as a crucial support level, as it played a role in Bitcoin‚Äôs rebound on June 15, leading to its yearly high of $31,800. Bitcoin Consolidation Conundrum The current situation appears to be slightly different for BTC. On the one hand, Bitcoin has been experiencing an extended consolidation phase just above this significant level for over seven days. Related Reading: Chainlink Price Prediction For September: Buy LINK Now? More concerning is that the cryptocurrency has been forming lower lows during this consolidation, indicating a downward pressure trend. Moreover, during Bitcoin‚Äôs rally on June 15, it had the advantage of holding its key 200-day Moving Average (MA), which has been influential in determining its prospects and upward gains. However, this same moving average presents a potential hurdle for BTC, acting as a resistance at the $27,100 level, potentially impeding a recovery rebound. As highlighted by crypto market analyst Michael Van De Poppe, the crucial question is whether Bitcoin will maintain its position above the 200-week EMA. Abnormally Low Trading Volume In Spot Market Raises Concerns On this matter, CryptoQuant author and crypto analyst Maartunn has identified an intriguing phenomenon in the BTC market that may shed light on the cryptocurrency‚Äôs recent stagnant state and low volatility. Maartunn has observed an abnormal pattern: the trading volume in the Bitcoin-spot market has reached its lowest level since 2017. This finding has significant implications for understanding the dynamics of BTC‚Äôs price and market behavior. The Bitcoin spot market plays a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It is where investors and traders buy and sell actual Bitcoins for immediate delivery instead of derivative products or futures contracts. Spot market trading volume reflects the level of participant activity and liquidity in the market, providing insights into the supply and demand dynamics of Bitcoin. The unusually low trading volume in the BTC-spot market suggests decreased market activity and engagement among traders. This lack of participation can contribute to stagnation and low volatility in BTC‚Äôs price. With fewer buyers and sellers entering the market, there may be limited price movement and a reduced likelihood of significant price swings. Such conditions can have implications for investors and traders. Low volatility may discourage short-term speculative trading strategies as the potential for quick profits diminishes. Additionally, it may indicate a lack of market confidence or uncertainty among participants, leading to a cautious approach and potential hesitation in making significant investment decisions. Monumental First Half Of 2024 For BTC? According to crypto analyst Miles Deutscher, the first half of 2024 is shaping to be a monumental period for the cryptocurrency market. Several key events and deadlines are anticipated during this timeframe, which could profoundly impact the industry and its major players. Starting in January through March, the spotlight will be on Bitcoin as the final deadline for approving the Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approach. The crypto community has long awaited the introduction of a Bitcoin ETF as it could potentially open the doors for broader institutional participation and investment in the digital asset. In May, another highly anticipated event is the Bitcoin halving. This recurring event, which occurs approximately every four years, reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are generated. Related Reading: XRP Bulls On The Horizon: Could A Breakout Push Prices Above $0.6? In June, the focus shifted to the Federal Reserve (FED) and its potential decision to cut interest rates.

After holding a roundtable to gather ideas, she said, the agency should set up a ‚Äúprogram for a specific period of time that incorporates many of the components drawn from past pilot programs, including: registration and eligibility requirements, financial resources and other conditions, risk management, products and contract terms, and other requirements including disclosures and reporting.‚Äù  Pham, who leads the CFTC‚Äôs Global Markets Advisory Committee and established its subcommittee on digital assets, has suggested a number of crypto initiatives since she arrived at the commission, including a proposal with Hester Peirce, her counterpart at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to host joint crypto roundtables with the two regulators. But the CFTC is led by Chairman Rostin Behnam, a Democratic appointee, who hasn‚Äôt embraced an industry-friendly posture for the agency.  As a result, Commissioner Pham‚Äôs overtures toward crypto innovation may remain on the CFTC‚Äôs back burner as the industry continues to wait for Congress to establish laws to govern the sector in the U.S.  ‚ÄúStaying ahead of the curve requires being ready to look to the future and preparing to embrace change,‚Äù Pham said.  Most of the crypto bills moving through Congress envision the CFTC as a leading regulator for digital asset spot markets, but it‚Äôs uncertain whether any legislation will make it to the president‚Äôs desk this year or next. Many Democratic lawmakers have been critical of the industry and side with SEC Chair Gary Gensler‚Äôs view that crypto businesses should be punished under existing securities regulations.

Currently, accounting rules only let companies record increases in the value of their digital assets when they sell them ‚Äì though losses are reflected at least once a year. But, on Wednesday, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) voted to take another path, letting companies use fair-value accounting that allows them to show gains and losses immediately on their income statements.  ""The decision is a significant development,"" said analysts at Stifel. They noted that generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in the U.S. force companies to write down the value of crypto assets when prices drop, but don't let them reverse those writedowns if prices subsequently rally ‚Äì meaning balance sheets can reflect substantially lower values than what the assets would fetch in the open market.  Read more: FASB Says Crypto Assets Should Be Marked at Current Values  ""We could see increased receptiveness towards holding digital assets on the books for U.S.-based companies, especially during periods when the market is hot given the improved impacts to the bottom line,"" the Stifel team said.  MicroStrategy (MSTR) Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, who began loading his company's balance sheet with bitcoin about three years ago, was less circumspect, saying the rule update ""eliminates a major impediment to corporate adoption of bitcoin as a treasury asset.""  The Stifel team noted MicroStrategy's roughly 152,300 bitcoin at the end of the second quarter were carried on the company's books at a value of $2.3 billion, a whopping 50% (or $2.3 billion) less than their fair market value at the time.  One caveat about the potential for adoption of crypto by companies is the level of risk aversion among CEOs and other senior executives, who are paid to run their businesses, invest reserves conservatively and deliver at least somewhat predictable earnings.  ""Most companies are widely held and not controlled by one majority holder (unlike Michael Saylor and MSTR), ex-hedge fund manager James Lavish wrote in November, when the momentum towards a switch to fair-value accounting was building. ""The career risk for those in charge is just too great for them to dive in and allocate their treasury cash to bitcoin in lieu of straight cash or U.S. [Treasuries].""  FASB is expected to formally approve final language later this year and companies at that point would be free to adopt the new standards.

Binance users will be able to trade bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and Tether‚Äôs USDT stablecoin with the Argentine peso, Brazilian real and South African rand on the spot market without paying any so-called maker fees, according to a Thursday blog post. Makers create orders and wait for them to be filled, while takers remove liquidity by taking available orders.  The exchange‚Äôs action comes as Binance faces legal and regulatory challenges in the U.S. and Europe, and crypto trading volumes hit the lowest levels since 2019, hurting revenue streams.  Binance last month shut its crypto payments service Connect to focus on its main products. It has also withdrawn from issuing branded debit cards in Latin America and the Middle East.  Boosting crypto trading with emerging market currencies makes sense for the exchange because developing countries are leading in crypto adoption, a Chainalysis study pointed out last year. Many people in countries with frail financial systems like Argentina are turning to digital assets to store value or hedge against volatility in the local currency.

42392647,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg947D,1694101500,Back to School: Supporting the Next Generation of Investors,"It's September, and the next generation of investors is back in class, many of whom are digital natives with much different investment interests from their parents and grandparents. Studies show that ""almost 60% of Gen Z and millennial investors own cryptocurrency and stocks, with crypto edging out stocks as the most popular investment.""  The Great Wealth Transfer is well underway and arguably the largest transfer of wealth in our history. Current estimates suggest that $70 trillion of assets are being transferred to the next generations of investors. It's already clear that many of these heirs don't or won't want the same investment advice offered to previous generations, and they are moving toward digital currencies and new investment products. When something this significant, this dynamic, and so removed from our current TradFI world blankets the industry, it's time that we all go back to school.  Erik Anderson of Global X talks us through the changing investor, their interest in digital assets, and how advisors can recognize and support the changing interests of the next-gen investors.  ‚Äì S.M.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk‚Äôs weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Advisors Who Ignore Digital Assets Could Be Left Behind: 3 Ways To Raise the Asset Class With Clients  Younger generations are increasingly interested in new asset types, with Millennials and Gen Z in particular favoring the decentralized composition of the digital asset markets. Yet despite this enthusiasm, apprehension around the asset class is also high and consistent across age groups: More than 40% of investors said cryptocurrency is ‚Äútoo risky‚Äù or ‚Äútoo confusing,‚Äù a recent study found.  Staying up to date on the market can be challenging, especially for those new to investing. That means financial advisors ‚Äì historically wary of the digital assets space ‚Äì have an exciting role to play. Regardless of an advisor‚Äôs personal views on the asset class, their clients are likely already getting exposure to the technological shift that is underway in some way, shape or form. Advisors in it for the long haul should want to be involved in these client conversations, not shut out of them.  Here are three ways advisors can help the next generation of investors cut through the noise and better understand how digital assets can be incorporated into their portfolios.  Explain what the asset class is and why it matters  Advisors can help arm investors with a foundational understanding of blockchain technology, the real influencer in the space and the enabler of digital and crypto assets.  Blockchain infrastructure can facilitate not only the management of digitally native forms of money but can also be used for a more diverse set of use cases, including decentralized applications and smart contracts. The database can be useful for many industries and can help processes like state recordkeeping, the democratization of private markets, supply chain management and copyright protection.  What‚Äôs happening with blockchain is similar to what we saw in the early days of the Internet. That said, the value proposition of blockchain can often be overshadowed by distracting news headlines and complex technical jargon. Advisors have to circumvent these roadblocks by focusing on demystifying the asset class and making exposure feel more accessible to investors.  Outline how to gain exposure to the asset class  After investors have a firmer grasp on the space, the question becomes how they can access the asset class. Advisors can help investors understand various ways they can go about this, including direct or semi-direct exposure (e.g., derivative instruments, private funds, SMAs, or ETPs) as well as indirect exposure through ETFs or crypto equities ‚Äì like public miners and exchanges.  An advisor‚Äôs guidance is particularly crucial when it comes to custody. If investors choose to self-custody, they need to understand that they are solely responsible for their digital assets. Being the point of protection comes with risk and responsibility. Meanwhile, an ETF with a digital assets related offering can offer a simple, low-cost way to gain diversified market exposure.  Many investors choose to begin with bitcoin, considered the simplest and most easily understood crypto asset for its name recognition, strong network effects and established product market fit. From this starting point, advisors can help investors explore other avenues, such as Ethereum.  Help determine how much to invest in the asset class  As with any asset class, determining how much of a diversified portfolio should be dedicated to digital or crypto assets really depends on the individual. Many growth portfolios have 1-5% allocated to the asset class, but for more traditional conservative portfolios, it may entirely not be a fit. Advisors can help clients consider their investment goals, risk tolerance, time horizon and even the broader macroeconomic environment before ultimately moving forward.  At the end of the day, many investors feel pressure to know everything about alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies, before pulling the trigger. That is often an unrealistic expectation, given the asset class is nuanced, and wrapping your head around it can be time-consuming. Instead, look to experts ‚Äì including advisors ‚Äì who are immersed in the space day-in, day-out, and there to help.  ‚Äì Erik Anderson, Senior Analyst, Global X  Ask an Advisor: Banking Access  Q: What is the bullish case for bitcoin when compared to fiat currencies and the traditional banking system?  A: ‚ÄúBanking the unbanked and unbanking the banked.‚Äù  One‚Äôs perception of value can vary widely depending upon one‚Äôs situation.  With a substantial portion of Africa still lacking access to the traditional banking system, Bitcoin offers the unbanked direct access to global commerce by circumventing banks.  On the other hand, many investors in developed markets have seen cracks emerging in the traditional financial system in 2023 with the collapse of three U.S. banks and contagion almost taking down two more, requiring government actions to stop further spread of the panic. This, followed up by the recent downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt by Fitch, could be viewed as a one-two punch to the once impenetrable USD.  ‚Äì Jon Henderson, CFP¬Æ, CRPC¬Æ, CBDA, Founder/CIO, Echo45 Advisors  Keep Reading  Social media app X, formerly known as Twitter, has obtained money or crypto transmitter licences in seven U.S. states.

Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) previewed the lawmaker ire in store for U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler as Congress returns from its summer break, with Hagerty accusing the regulator of stomping on crypto innovation during a speech on Thursday.  He and other senators on the Senate Banking Committee will get their chance to question Gensler directly next week when he appears for a routine hearing on SEC oversight on Sept. 12. But that‚Äôs not enough for Hagerty, who told a Cato Institute audience that the Democrat-controlled panel should be scheduling more hearings to specifically examine what Gensler and SEC are doing to the U.S. crypto sector.  ‚ÄúIt is a terrible environment,‚Äù said Hagerty, who pushed crypto legislation in 2022 to set up basic guardrails for stablecoins, though it never advanced. ‚ÄúFor those companies who are trying to invest and expand, it's forcing them to look overseas to more favorable regulatory environments. That's not where we need to be right now.‚Äù  Hagerty said that Gensler‚Äôs adversarial relationship with crypto ‚Äúis damaging the industry,‚Äù though he also criticized U.S. banking regulators for creating an atmosphere among banks that makes them wary of crypto connections.  He declined to guess which of the ongoing crypto legislative efforts are most likely to make headway, though he said Congress should go at it incrementally, biting off smaller pieces rather than a comprehensive approach. He said that‚Äôs what his two-page Stablecoin Transparency Act was trying to do, just setting up some simple rules more immediately.  The Senate Banking Committee ‚Äì led by Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) ‚Äì stands as the fulcrum of future crypto legislation, and its senior Democrats have been relatively quiet on their intentions. While the House Financial Services Committee has advanced crypto bills to the floor in the other chamber, it‚Äôs unclear what Brown‚Äôs panel will do with any of it.

Insurance within the crypto industry is sparse, and experimental areas like DeFi present a set of risks that even digital asset underwriting specialists tend to shy away from. On the other hand, there exists an excess of capital looking to be deployed by DeFi cover pioneers like Nexus Mutual.  OpenCover, which raised $4 million in a seed round led by the likes of NFX and Jump Crypto, received a $200,000 funding bump from Coinbase to bolster its debut on Base, according to OpenCover CEO Jeremiah Smith.  The insurance alternative, which is also rolling out on Optimism, another Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, is working with Aave, Uniswap, Curve, Safe, Morpho, Synthetix, Beefy, Angle, 1inch and Yearn, Smith said.  ‚ÄúOpenCover is an insurance alternative and cover aggregator that essentially offers protection against protocol failures, such as what happened with Curve a few weeks back,‚Äù Smith said in an interview with CoinDesk. ‚ÄúWe have $200-plus million in underwriting capital from Nexus that is now directly accessible for the very first time on a layer 2.‚Äù",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MINING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/09/07/coinbase-backed-insurance-alternative-opencover-debuts-on-layer-2-blockchain-base,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/17b0cdd01a3e9b0e8a5f30bc4b6b080d742fb400-6032x3393.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin STH SOPR Hasn‚Äôt Hit The Bottom Zone Yet An analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post explained that the BTC short-term holders are selling at a loss. The relevant indicator here is the ‚ÄúSpent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR),‚Äù which tells us whether the Bitcoin holders are selling their coins at a profit or a loss. When the value of this indicator is greater than 1, it means that the average holder in the market is moving their coins at a profit. On the other hand, values below this threshold imply that loss-taking is the dominant force in the sector. The SOPR being exactly equal to one naturally suggests that the market is just breaking even on its selling right now as the total amount of realized profits cancel out the losses. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV At Critical Support Line, Will Retest Be Successful? The SOPR can also be defined for just a part of the market. In the context of the current discussion, the short-term holder (STH) group is of interest. These investors have been holding onto their coins since less than 155 days ago. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) Bitcoin SOPR over the past several years: Looks like the 30-day MA value of the metric has been going down in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin STH SOPR had been above one for most of the year 2023, but following the recent struggle in the asset‚Äôs price, the indicator has dipped below this mark. Historically, the one indicator level has been a line of support for the cryptocurrency, as it has often found rebounds. For example, Bitcoin found bottoms at this mark during the slumps in both March and June. With the recent drawdown, though, this support level has been breached, as the STHs are now selling their coins at a loss. Usually, whenever the metric dips below this level, it doesn‚Äôt come back above it quickly, as the line begins to act as resistance instead. The Bitcoin STH SOPR has historically been able to find rebounds in the green box that the quant has highlighted in the chart. The indicator is still a notable distance above this bottoming zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLer Dominance Rises To Record Levels, Bullish Sign? If the BTC price will only find its rebound when the indicator dips inside this zone, then more decline could be ahead for the asset so that the STHs are pushed into capitulating at a deeper degree.

Top Financial Organizations Join Forces With Polygon To Create Tokenized Securities Network In the early hours of today, September 7, 2023, South Korea‚Äôs largest financial group, Mirae Asset Securities, with over $500 Billion under manager, announced they are connecting to the Polygon network. According to the report, the collaboration aims to increase the adoption of Web3 technologies and develop a tokenized securities community. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin A Buy Or Sell? Ark Invest Shares Market Analysis In a press release, the asset manager said that Polygon Labs will be the chief technical consultant in the Token Working Group of Mirae Asset Securities. The asset manager said the group would work ‚Äúefficiently‚Äù to create infrastructure to issue, exchange, and distribute token-based securities. According to the Head of the digital assets division at Mirae Asset Securities, Ahn In-sung: Polygon Labs is a leading global blockchain technology development company that is innovating throughout all aspects of Web3. Through technical collaboration with Polygon Labs, Mirae Asset Securities aims to establish global leadership in the field of tokenized securities. Notably, several financial companies are included in this collaboration. These include Linger Studio and Coin Plug, Hana Financial, and SK Telecom‚Äôs security token consortium, Next Finance Initiative (NFI). According to the report, Big finance names like Franklin Templeton and Hamilton Lane, a big investment company with over $823.9 billion in assets, are already using Polygon for tokenization projects. Will Polygon‚Äôs Partnership With Mirae Asset Securities Affect MATIC‚Äôs Price? The Partnership between Polygon Labs and Mirae Asset Securities to advance tokenization will benefit Web3 adoption within the ecosystem and could boost MATIC‚Äôs price. On September 5, Polygon 2.0 was announced with Zero Knowledge L2 chains, three Governance pillars, and the Polygon Business Model part of the new upgrades.¬†This upgrade will likely attract investors like Mirae Asset Securities to rely on Polygon for different purposes. From September 1-3, MATIC traded in the $0.54 range but has increased to $0.56 today, September 7. It implies that the partnership is likely driving the slight gains noticed in the last 24 hours and might signal an uptrend ahead for MATIC. MATIC has formed six consecutive green candles on the daily chart, suggesting buyers defend current levels. Also, it found critical support at $0.55, with its next price moves likely to send it to the $0.57 resistance level. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction ‚Äì Breaking This Confluence Resistance Could Spark Recovery If the buyers persist, MATIC can break above the $0.57 resistance level and move into an uptrend.¬†The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator, with a value of 41.57, shows a neutral sentiment among investors.¬†However, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) displays a buy signal confirmed by the green Histogram bars. MATIC will likely record a positive price action in the coming days based on a more positive investor sentiment and valuable partnerships.

42392645,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg94CL,1694088060,First Mover Americas: Crypto Trading Volume Hits 4-Year Low,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk‚Äôs daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Crypto spot trading is at its lowest level since March 2019, according to digital assets data provider CCData, shedding some light on the soporific state of the market. Spot trading volume on centralized exchanges fell 7.78% to $475 billion in August, while volume in derivatives fell over 12% to $1.62 trillion, the second-lowest since 2021. An event such as Grayscale‚Äôs court victory over the SEC last week would have been expected to stoke a rally in crypto prices, but even this failed to spur traders into activity. ""The low spot trading volume and the fluctuations in the open interest data suggest that the market is currently driven by speculation,"" CCData said.  Major South Korean investment banking firm Mirae Asset Securities is working with the Polygon network to advance tokenization within finance. The Ethereum scaling network will serve as a technical consultant to the $500 billion asset manager, which is looking to create infrastructure to issue, exchange and distribute tokenized securities. Tokenization involves representing real-world assets such as bonds, equities and physical assets as digital tokens that can be traded on the blockchain, the theory being that this will make transacting them more efficient, transparent and liquid. Mirae would join other institutions such as Franklin Templeton in initiating tokenization projects on Polygon.  Cboe‚Äôs BZX exchange filed the paperwork on Wednesday to list spot ether (ETH) ETFs of Ark 21Shares and VanEck. Coinbase will act as the surveillance-sharing partner for both products, similar to its proposed role in a large number of spot bitcoin (BTC) ETFs. Once the SEC acknowledges the filings, it will have 240 days to return a decision, a period it usually allows to go the distance. If either fund is approved, it would be the first spot ether ETF to list in the U.S. and possibly the first such product for any crypto asset. It remains to be seen whether ether ETF applications will meet the same fate of ongoing delays and rejections by the SEC that have beset bitcoin products.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows Google Trends' values for the worldwide search query ""cryptocurrency"" for the past 10 years.  The value has declined to eight this week, the lowest in at least three years, showing dwindling general interest in digital assets.  Google Trends is widely used to gauge general or retail interest in trending topics. Low values have historically marked bear market bottoms, while values near 100 have signaled bull market peaks.

42392639,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg93hZ,1694088000,"Find Who‚Äôs Responsible for DeFi Projects and Regulate Them, Global Securities Body Says","Governments should figure out who‚Äôs responsible for supposedly decentralized finance applications and regulate them just like normal financial market players, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) said in a report published Thursday.  The global standard setter, whose members include bodies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, worries innovative financial applications could be easily manipulated ‚Äì and appears skeptical about the premise that there‚Äôs nobody in control to pin legal obligations on.  In principle, decentralized finance (DeFi) ‚Äì allowing lending or trading to take place using algorithms, tokens and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) ‚Äì turn on their head many of the premises of regular financial regulation, which relies on finding a central person or company responsible for keeping markets fair and protecting investors.  But officials at IOSCO appear to share the view that the supposed decentralization of DeFi is an illusion, and are calling on national regulators to act.  ‚ÄúThere is a common misconception that DeFi is truly decentralized and governed by autonomous code or smart contracts,‚Äù Tuang Lee Lim, Chair of IOSCO‚Äôs Board-Level Fintech Task Force, said in a statement. ‚ÄúIn reality, regardless of the operating model of the DeFi arrangement, 'responsible persons' can be identified.‚Äù  Recommendations published by IOSCO say national regulators should identify who‚Äôs really in charge, and given them obligations to uphold investor protection and market integrity on a par with what‚Äôs done in traditional finance (TradFi).  Depending on exactly how existing TradFi rules are written, DeFi may be noncompliant, or simply outside of scope ‚Äì but officials warn that pseudonymity and opaque governance may make it harder to identify collusion or conflicts of interest, allowing risks like front-running, hacks, or excessive leverage.  ‚ÄúThe regulatory approach should be functionally based to achieve regulatory outcomes for investor protection and market integrity that are the same as, or consistent with, those that are required in traditional financial markets,‚Äù the IOSCO report said.  The report comes hours after the Financial Stability Board and International Monetary Fund jointly called for comprehensive, global approach to crypto regulation, as leaders from the world‚Äôs twenty biggest economies gather for a summit in New Delhi, India.

42392628,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg92sH,1694087192,Blockchain and AI Are Set to Transform Financial Markets: Moody's,"Applying the blockchain technology that underpins crypto and artificial intelligence to financial markets could help issuers of instruments like bonds reduce costs in the next five years.  Despite blockchain's promises, Moody's warned that if not regulated well, it could potentially challenge sovereign authority and fuel tax evasion.  Blockchain technologies that underpin crypto could help issuers of financial instruments like bonds reduce financing costs in the next five years, according to a report by credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service.  While incorporating these technologies into businesses could increase IT costs and require ""substantial investment"" at first, it could help lower expenses over time, the report published Wednesday said.  Recent innovations have increased the transformative potential of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed ledger technology (DLT) when applied to financial markets, Moody's said. While AI could potentially reduce operating expenses for financial institutions by automating manual tasks, DLT could ""gradually lower financing expenses, especially for smaller issuers,"" according to the report.  ""DLT could improve financial market efficiency, modernize the payment system, and foster financial inclusion,"" Vincent Gusdorf, head of DeFi and digital asset analytics, said in a press statement shared with CoinDesk. ""The overall economic and financial effects of technological changes, including the policy and strategic changes they prompt, are likely to be positive.""  Digital or tokenized bonds, which are becoming popular in global markets, could lower transaction expenses and make capital markets more accessible by letting organizations bypass intermediaries like banks and by increasing liquidity on the secondary market, the report said. Hong Kong's central bank arrived at similar conclusions following a successful $100 million tokenized bond issue from earlier this year.  DLT could also enable some businesses to capture untapped revenue opportunities and enter new markets.  Although the effects of employing these new technologies in finance will likely be positive, ""they will vary greatly by country, region, company, and worker, with some suffering from technology-driven disruption,"" the report said.  The technology's promise, however, comes with drawbacks such as potentially challenging sovereign authority and fueling tax evasion, money laundering and terrorism if not used and regulated well.  Moody's said it plans to track how technological transformation in financial markets fueled by AI and DLT could affect credit risk stemming from borrowers failing to repay loans.

After reaching a high of $0.936, the coin took a nosedive to hit the $0.5 mark, leaving investors in a state of uncertainty. With a current price of $0.502574 according to CoinGecko, XRP is experiencing a minor 0.3% decline in the last 24 hours, contributing to a seven-day slump of 4.8%. However, a recent price report has sparked hope among XRP enthusiasts, suggesting a potential rebound that could change the game for this digital asset. The report indicates that a potential rebound from the current bottom could serve as a catalyst for bullish momentum. If the crypto manages to break above the critical resistance level at $0.556, it is expected to ignite a surge in buying pressure, possibly driving the price up to $0.665. This price movement could rejuvenate investor sentiment and restore confidence in XRP as a viable investment option. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Maze: Will It Soar To $2,000 Or Stay At $1,500 In September? Caution In A Downtrend For XRP Holders Despite the optimistic outlook, the report also offers a word of caution. In established downtrends, assets tend to undergo short consolidations to recover from exhausted bearish momentum before continuing their downward trajectory. For the Ripple native currency, this means that it may breach the $0.486 support level, potentially leading to a 13% drop to reach $0.42. Investors should remain vigilant and consider both the potential for a rebound and the risks associated with a further decline. XRP market cap currently at $26 billion.

Elevation Capital, StarkWare Ltd, Spartan Group, Goodwater Capital, Upsparks Ventures, Protofund Ventures were among those also participating in the fundraising round.  The fresh funding is notable given that venture capital for digital asset firms has mostly dried up, with cryptocurrency and blockchain startups receiving 76% less investment in Q2 2023 than the same period one year earlier, Crunchbase reported in July.  Trading volumes have also plummeted to multi-year lows during the summer as the crypto bear market has moved into the apathy stage thanks to a lack of catalysts to attract investors. After enjoying a brief increase in the spring this year, volumes on DEXs have since sharply dropped and averaged at just above $1 billion per day recently, according to DefiLlama data. Most of the trading volume is still concentrated on centralized platforms such as Binance and Coinbase, executing near $11 billion daily trading volume, data by The Block shows.  Brine Fi, powered by Ethereum scaling system StarkWare, is a non-custodial, decentralized orderbook that allows privacy for trading positions via so-called zero-knowledge proofs. Traders can thus place large orders without worrying about front-running or spooking others. The platform also boasts high-speed trade execution. It opened for traders in May, and recently executed $3 million - $4 million daily trading volume.  ‚ÄúBrine tackles some of the most important challenges holding back institutional and mainstream user adoption in DeFi,‚Äù Paul Veradittakit, managing partner at Pantera Capital, said in a statement. ‚ÄúThere's an urgent demand for a self-custodial execution layer that is faster, more reliable, user-friendly, and cost-effective.‚Äù",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TRADING | BNB,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/09/07/pantera-capital-leads-165m-investment-in-zk-powered-dex-brine-fi-at-100m-valuation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7724faa2c3b7c33afa910ac73244604ea24ee1b2-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419673,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFHzh,1694082912,Crypto Spot Market August Trading Volume Hits 4.5-Year Low as Volatility Fails to Spur Activity,"Aggregate crypto spot and derivatives trading volume contracted 11.5% to $2.09 trillion in August.  The low spot-trading volume and fluctuations in derivatives open interest point to a speculation-driven market.  Binance retained the top spot in both segments despite dwindling market share.  Activity in the crypto spot market fell to the lowest level in more than four years last month, extending a lull at digital asset trading desks, as volatility sparked by Grayscale Investments' court victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission failed to stir traders from their torpor.  Spot trading volume on centralized exchanges cooled for a second straight month, falling 7.78% to $475 billion, the least since March 2019, according to digital assets data and index provider CCData. Trading volume refers to the total number of tokens that changed hands during a specific period.  Volume in derivatives fell over 12% to $1.62 trillion, the second-lowest since 2021, and derivatives' share of total market activity contracted for a third consecutive month to 77.3%. The dollar value locked in open derivatives contracts tanked 19.5% to $17.1 billion, wiping out $4.13 billion in open interest on selected exchanges. That's the largest decline in open interest this year.  The continuing decline is creating a challenging environment for exchanges and market makers, who have been facing a tough time since Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange went bust last November. The collapse dented investor confidence in centralized exchanges and cratered market depth. According to Bloomberg, the profit margin of market makers has declined by 30% since the collapse of FTX.  ""The combined trading volume of spots and derivatives on centralized exchanges fell 11.5% to $2.09 trillion as the volatility following the Grayscale's victory over SEC failed to translate into trading volumes on centralized exchanges,"" CCData said in a report shared with CoinDesk. ""The low spot trading volume and the fluctuations in the open interest data suggest that the market is currently driven by speculation.""  Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.  Volume figures might have been worse had it not been for the brief volatility spike on Aug. 17 and at the end of the month. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell over 10% to $25,000 on Aug. 17, tracking risk aversion in traditional markets. The price briefly rose to $28,000 Aug. 29, cheering Grayscale's legal victory over the SEC.  Among exchanges, Binance's spot market share contracted for the sixth straight month to 38.5%, the lowest since August 2022. Its share in derivatives dropped to 53.5%, the weakest since June 2022. Still, the exchange retained the top spot, recording $183 billion in spot trading volume and $865 billion in derivatives. In June, the U.S. SEC charged Binance for violating securities law.  In contrast, Huobi's share in the global spot market activity rose 2.26% and accounted for 6.09% of the total spot market volume. That made it the second-largest centralized spot exchange by volume.  In derivatives, Bitget and Bybit saw their shares in the total activity increase to 8.66% and 12.7%, respectively.  Total crypto derivatives volume on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, considered a proxy for institutional activity, rose 4.51% to $41.9 billion, with volumes in ether options hitting an all-time high of $365 million.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/07/crypto-spot-market-august-trading-volume-hits-45-year-low-as-volatility-fails-to-spur-activity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9eaa83bc2854c338b13e61a1383cd0998b7f85e2-2712x1253.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

17248613,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550371,1694080857,Chainlink Price Prediction For September: Buy LINK Now?,"Chainlink (LINK) has been a standout in the crypto market recently, registering an 11% increase over the past six days, even as the broader crypto market sentiment remains subdued. Will Uptober Start Early For Chainlink? A significant factor that might be driving this price action is the behavior of LINK‚Äôs major holders. On-Chain analysis firm, Santiment, highlighted this in a recent tweet, stating:¬†‚ÄúChainlink‚Äôs key shark tier that holds between 10K-100K LINK has been on an accumulation spree.‚Äù Diving deeper into the data, there are now 3,127 wallets holding between 10,000-100,000 LINK, marking the highest level since December 3, 2022. These wallets have added a staggering $9.6 million worth of LINK in just three days. Since September 3rd, there‚Äôs been a 3.2% rise in the number of wallets in this category, with 98 new wallets emerging. This group has accumulated 0.154% of the entire LINK supply in the same period. Related Reading: LINK Price Prediction: Chainlink Needs To Clear $6.25 For Hopes of a Fresh Rally However, Chainlink‚Äôs journey hasn‚Äôt been entirely smooth. The token has been ensnared in a sideways range for an exhausting 485 days, which is over 15 months. The LINK/BTC pair has been on a downward trajectory for more than three years. Chainlink‚Äôs much-anticipated release of the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) was met with significant hype. Yet, despite its potential to revolutionize cross-chain communication, its release didn‚Äôt provide the expected boost to LINK‚Äôs price. Also the news that a tokenization experiment by interbank messaging system Swift and Chainlink successfully transferred value across multiple blockchains could not move price substantially. In June Chainlink and Swift announced that they would be collaborating with dozens of financial institutions such as BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon, The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation and Lloyds Banking Group and others. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Shares Bullish Insights On Chainlink As Users Accumulate 295 Million LINK However, the upcoming Chainlink‚Äôs SmartCon in October from October 2nd to 3rd might be the catalyst the token needs. Rumors are rife about a potential major announcement between Swift and Chainlink Labs, which could connect web3 infrastructure to the banks involved in previous tests. If history is any indication, Chainlink could experience a surge in price leading up to the event, driven by the euphoria and speculation. ‚ÄúUptober‚Äù could come early for the Chainlink price. LINK Technical Analysis The recent 11% surge in LINK‚Äôs price suggests that the market might already be reacting to the upcoming hype. However, the 4-hour chart indicates a rejection at the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $6.37, which aligns closely with the 200 EMA at $6.40. For LINK to sustain its upward trajectory, it‚Äôs imperative to breach this level, with the next significant target being the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $7.08. The 1-week chart paints a picture of LINK‚Äôs prolonged downtrend. The recent hold above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $5.92 is a positive sign for the bulls, potentially paving the way for another try on the upper trendline of the downtrend channel. However, several difficult challenges lie ahead. The 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $7.20 is the first major resistance. If LINK can push past this, a breakout from the 15-month downtrend channel becomes possible.¬†For this to happen, Chainlink would need to break above the $8.30-$8.40 area as it currently stands, and would then encounter the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $8.58. Large selling pressure can be expected at this point. Should LINK falter at this juncture, a return to the downtrend channel is likely. Conversely, if the $8.58 mark is surpassed, it would signal a significant win for the bulls, potentially setting LINK on a path to challenge its 15-month high at $9.61.

The second largest bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner in terms of market capitalization earned¬†$31.7M in credits from Texas power grid operator ERCOT in August, surpassing the total credits received in 2022.¬†In Q2, it'd earned $13.5M in power credits. During the record-breaking¬†heatwave in August, Riot ( RIOT ) voluntarily curtailed its power use by over 95% and¬†sold power back to the Texas grid through its fixed¬†low-price contracts. The credits, which significantly lower Riot's ( RIOT ) cost to mine, equated to ~1,136 BTC. That's much higher than its bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) production in August, when it mined 333 BTC, an 18.8% drop from July's tally. It is becoming increasingly less profitable to mine bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), given lower BTC prices and higher network hash rate deteriorating margins. ""Riot's power strategy is a key competitive advantage, and when placed alongside our strong financial position and efficient miner fleet, put Riot in a leading position heading into the upcoming bitcoin 'halving' event next year,""¬†said CEO Jason Les. Most BTC miners have been operating at lower uptimes due to the summer heat, although Jefferies' Jonathan Petersen expects this will moderate soon. Riot ( RIOT ) more than tripled in value YTD as bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rebounded this year from 2022 lows, but the stock is still well below the $79.50 peak seen in 2021.

Large holders of PEPE tokens have been selling their holdings at a loss, leading to increased market uncertainty. A recent report notes the meme coin‚Äôs price movements are strongly influenced by its presence in the social sector. However, over the last week, social activity surrounding PEPE has taken a notable downturn, with social engagements falling by 28% and social mentions decreasing by 18%. Related Reading: Ethereum Bears Gain Upper Hand With Escalating Sell-Off: Impact On ETH Price Whale Exodus: Massive PEPE Transfers Raise Eyebrows Lookonchain, a blockchain analysis platform, shed light on a puzzling development as it uncovered that three wallets, potentially controlled by the same individual, had transferred a staggering 1.5 trillion PEPE tokens to the popular cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. An hour ago, 3 wallets (probably the same person) deposited 1.5T $PEPE ($1.2M) into #Binance at a loss of $242K. These 3 wallets withdrew 1.5T $PEPE($1.45M at the time) from #OKX after the Pepe team dumped 16T $PEPE on August 24. pic.twitter.com/StKCuGMGFZ ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 6, 2023 At current exchange rates, these tokens are valued at approximately $1.2 million. What raises eyebrows is the fact that these wallets sold their tokens at a price lower than when they initially acquired them, resulting in a collective loss of $242,000. This mass transfer followed an unexpected 16 trillion PEPE transaction on August 24, where the tokens were worth a staggering $1.45 million. Official Response: ‚ÄòEx-Team Members‚Äô Accused Of Theft According to a separate report, the team behind PEPE issued a statement alleging that ‚Äúthree ex-team members‚Äù had accessed the project‚Äôs multisig wallet without the consent of others and absconded with a substantial 16 trillion PEPE tokens. This revelation sent shockwaves through the community and further fueled the uncertainty surrounding the meme coin. As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies was barely unchanged at $1.02 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com While the recent decline in social activity and the questionable whale transactions have cast a shadow over PEPE‚Äôs future, an intriguing aspect emerges from the data. Despite the reduced social engagement, the weighted sentiment around the memecoin has continued to grow. This suggests that, at the time of writing, there are more positive comments and sentiments surrounding PEPE than negative ones, potentially indicating resilience within the community. Related Reading: Pepe Coin September Challenge: Can It Reach $0.000001 Again? As of the most recent data available, PEPE is trading at $0.000000801962 according to CoinGecko, with a modest 0.5% gain in the last 24 hours. However, over the past seven days, it has experienced a 6.5% decline in value.

42419667,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFHtV,1694073600,"Blanket Crypto Bans Won‚Äôt Work, IMF and FSB Warn in Joint Paper","A joint policy paper on crypto published by the IMF and FSB warned jurisdictions against implementing blanket bans to mitigate risks associated with the sector, and recommended targeted restrictions and sound monetary policy instead.  Global stablecoins, which are designed to hold a stable value, could become abruptly volatile and pose a greater risk to financial stability than other crypto, the paper said.  Just banning cryptocurrency won't eliminate its risks, a joint policy roadmap published by global standard setters Thursday said.  The policy paper, commissioned by the intergovernmental forum G20 under India‚Äôs leadership, combines norms set by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other international standard-setters for the crypto sector in one report, which found ‚Äúcomprehensive regulatory and supervisory oversight of crypto-assets should be a baseline to address macroeconomic and financial stability risks.‚Äù  The IMF-FSB synthesis paper is set to be presented to the G20 this weekend and is part of a series of efforts by international bodies to introduce global norms for the industry, particularly following the numerous crypto enterprise collapses of 2022.  To tackle macroeconomic risks from crypto, the report says jurisdictions should ‚Äústrengthen monetary policy frameworks, guard against excessive capital flow volatility and adopt unambiguous tax treatment of crypto.‚Äù  Thursday‚Äôs report reiterated the IMF‚Äôs stance that crypto blanket bans may not help in mitigating associated risks and added that targeted restrictions might come in handy for emerging economies in particular.  Countries like India have raised concerns about the enhanced threat from widespread crypto use to monetary policy in emerging economies, and have called for policy bodies to recommend stronger prohibitions or address those specific concerns.  Read more: G20 Set to Crystalize Global Crypto Rules as India Wraps Up Presidency  Targeted restrictions  Imposing blanket bans that make all crypto activities ‚Äì including trading and mining ‚Äì illegal in one jurisdiction is not only expensive and technically challenging, but ‚Äúcould also lead to activity migrating to other jurisdictions, creating spillover risks,‚Äù according to the report.  ‚ÄúRestrictions should not substitute for robust macroeconomic policies, credible institutional frameworks, and comprehensive regulation and oversight, which are the first line of defense against the macroeconomic and financial risks posed by crypto-assets,‚Äù it said.  But that doesn‚Äôt mean all prohibitions should be off the table. The IMF and FSB say jurisdictions might consider targeted and temporary restrictions to manage some risk factors in stressful times or while countries find better internal fixes. The paper appeared to reference some examples of such restrictions at play, such as the targeted restrictions on anonymity-enhancing ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù coins in places like Dubai, to a ban on Nigerian banks serving crypto firms.  ‚ÄúSome jurisdictions, in particular emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), may want to take additional targeted measures that go beyond the global regulatory baseline to address specific risks,‚Äù it added.  Stablecoins  The IMF-FSB roadmap addressed another concern of G20 countries about the proliferation of stablecoins ‚Äì which are crypto stabilized against the value of other assets or currencies ‚Äì threatening currency replacement or bank runs in emerging economies.  ‚ÄúRapid capital flight (or reversals) could materialize if foreign currency-denominated stablecoins became easier and cheaper to hold in large quantities relative to foreign currency bank accounts,‚Äù the paper said.  While they could facilitate a wide range of transactions, the report said stablecoins may have distinct risks that come with maintaining a stable value, and dependency on private issuers ‚Äì something that played out in real time as algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD de-pegged from the U.S. dollar in a matter of days wiping billions from the market in 2022.  It added that global stablecoins adopted by multiple jurisdictions ‚Äúmay transmit volatility more abruptly than other crypto-assets and may cause significant risk to financial stability.‚Äù  Read more: Stablecoin Regulation Is a Sticking Point Between the G7 and G20  Jack Schickler contributed reporting.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/07/blanket-crypto-bans-wont-work-joint-imf-fsb-paper-warns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4580ade63877052c518f5cd1dcd4c24a33bcbff-6561x3691.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Almost half the 60 buy-side professionals from U.S. and European-based asset managers and hedge funds surveyed between May and June are actively managing digital assets, according to the report, Digital Assets: Managers Fuel Data Infrastructure Needs.  Most of the managers see the digital assets industry growing in the next five years in terms of assets under management, with over 40% estimating a compound annual growth rate of at least 11%, and about a fifth forecasting 20% or more.  A quarter of the firms already have a specific digital assets strategy, and another 13% are looking to unveil one over the next two years.  Overall, asset managers are optimistic about the growth opportunities in the digital assets industry and commercial opportunities to offer products like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and tokenized securities.  Asset managers remain optimistic about the U.S. as a crypto destination and expect American regulators to eventually provide a prudent regulatory framework for the industry. That's surprising, the report said, considering the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) enforcement actions against leading crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase.  Perhaps equally surprising is that most managers expect centralized exchanges to grow over the next five years. Since the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange FTX in November last year, investors have increasingly preferred to take direct custody of their coins, choosing to hold them off centralized exchanges.  The report also said the industry is still evolving, and managers are bullish on the most obvious use cases like crypto portfolios, investment products, and tokenization of financial instruments.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/09/07/depressed-crypto-markets-regulatory-risks-fail-to-dissuade-asset-managers-from-investing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be82eff8c62140cd635d179854cb37a8158c8ba6-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

17242065,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550348,1694071850,Is Bitcoin A Buy Or Sell? Ark Invest Shares Market Analysis,"In its new monthly report titled ‚ÄúThe Bitcoin Monthly: Bitcoin Battles Resistance Around Its On-Chain Mean‚Äù, Ark Invest has provided an exhaustive analysis of the current market landscape. The report categorizes its findings into bullish, neutral, and bearish perspectives, providing a holistic view of Bitcoin‚Äôs current and potential future stance. Bullish Arguments For Bitcoin Grayscale Spot ETF and GBTC‚Äôs Discount To NAV: On August 29, a pivotal decision was made by a US Federal Appeals Court. They ruled that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must revisit and reconsider its earlier rejection of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust‚Äôs (GBTC) application to transition into a spot ETF. This legal development saw GBTC‚Äôs discount to NAV shift from -24% to -18% on the same day, indicating heightened market optimism. By the end of August, GBTC was at a discount-to-NAV of -20.6%. Bitcoin‚Äôs General Cost Basis Recovery: Bitcoin‚Äôs realized capitalization, which encompasses both its primary (miners) and secondary (investors) markets, is a measure of the aggregate cost basis of BTC. Between Q4 2022 and Q1 2023, the realized cap drawdown stood at -19%, marking its steepest since 2012. This drawdown serves as a barometer for capital outflows from the network. Ark‚Äôs analysis suggests that the deeper the drawdown, the higher the likelihood of Bitcoin holders exiting the market, potentially setting the stage for a more robust bull market. The realized cap has improved from its all-time high in 2021, moving from a 19% low post the FTX collapse in November 2022 to 15.6%, indicating capital inflows over the past 8 months. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLer Dominance Rises To Record Levels, Bullish Sign? Futures Open Interest Collapse: August 17 witnessed a rapid liquidation of Bitcoin futures by 21.7%, the swiftest since December 2021. Ark Invest interprets this price correction as a ‚Äúcathartic sentiment correction.‚Äù Neutral Arguments Bitcoin Price and the 200-Week Moving Average: August was a challenging month for Bitcoin as its price dipped by 5.4%, settling below its 200-week moving average at $27,580. This was the first instance since June 2023. However, Ark Invest posits that Bitcoin should find substantial downside support at its realized price of $20,300. Bitcoin‚Äôs On-Chain Mean Resistance: The ‚Äúon-chain mean,‚Äù also termed as the ‚Äúactive-investor price‚Äù or ‚Äútrue market mean,‚Äù reached $29,608 in August, establishing a potential significant resistance for BTC. This metric, a collaborative effort between ARK Invest and Glassnode, calculated by dividing investors‚Äô cost basis by the number of active coins. These coins are determined based on the aggregate time they‚Äôve remained dormant relative to the total supply. Stablecoins Market Cap and Liquidity: Stablecoins, often viewed as a liquidity barometer for the market, have seen their 90-day supply drop over 20% from $162 billion in March 2022 to $120 billion currently, signaling a decline in onchain liquidity. However, net inflows during the same timeframe hint at a building bullish market momentum. Bearish Arguments For BTC (All Macro) Real GDP vs. Real GDI Growth Rates: A record divergence has been observed between the YoY percent changes in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and real Gross Domestic Income (GDI). Historically, GDP and GDI should be on par, as income earned should equate to the value of goods and services produced. Former Federal Reserve economist, Jeremy Nalewaik, has posited that GDI might be a more accurate indicator than GDP. Related Reading: Turning Point For Bitcoin And Crypto? DXY At 5-Month High Real Federal Funds Policy Rate vs. Natural Rate of Interest: For the first time since 2009, the Real Federal Funds Policy Rate has surpassed the Natural Rate of Interest, indicating a shift towards restrictive monetary policy. This theoretical rate, as conceptualized by New York Federal Reserve President, John Williams, is the rate where the economy neither expands nor contracts. With monetary policy‚Äôs impact on the economy being long and variable, lending and borrowing are expected to face increased downward pressure. Government‚Äôs Employment Revision: Employment, a lagging indicator, has been pivotal in the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate decisions. Despite the labor disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic expected to have been resolved by now, the government has revised nonfarm payroll statistics downward for six consecutive months. This suggests a weaker labor market than initially reported. The last instance of such a trend, outside of a recession, was in 2007, right before the Great Financial Crisis. In summary, Ark Invest‚Äôs report presents three bullish, four neutral, and three bearish arguments on Bitcoin and the broader market, emphasizing that the market could be at a crucial turning point. At press time, BTC traded at $25,789.

42419663,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFHpN,1694070241,"MiCA, EU‚Äôs Comprehensive New Crypto Regulation, Explained","The European Union‚Äôs Markets in Crypto Assets regulation, MiCA, is due to take effect in 2024, making it the first major jurisdiction in the world to introduce comprehensive, tailored rules for the sector.  MiCA‚Äôs arrival has met great fanfare. France‚Äôs Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire hailed it as a ‚Äúlandmark‚Äù that ‚Äúwill put an end to the crypto Wild West,‚Äù while Binance CEO Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao welcomed the ‚Äúclear rules of the game‚Äù for crypto exchanges.  New crypto measures, which aim to facilitate legal certainty for businesses and attract more investment to the region, will apply in 27 countries that collectively represent nearly one-fifth of the global economy.  It‚Äôs usually pronounced mee-kuh, by the way. Here‚Äôs what the law contains, its controversial issues and what‚Äôs next.  Tough Compliance  MiCA‚Äôs 150-odd pages are based on existing EU rules for securities trading ‚Äì and compliance could prove tough for companies new to regulation. But it‚Äôs not merely a copy and paste of the rulebook for stocks and bonds.  Any company seeking to offer crypto services within the bloc ‚Äì whether that‚Äôs custody, trading, portfolio management or advice ‚Äì will need to be authorized by one of the EU‚Äôs 27 national financial regulators.  Any company offering crypto assets to the public will also need to publish a white paper which is fair and clear, warning of risks without misleading potential buyers.  MiCA doesn‚Äôt shoehorn crypto into existing regulatory boxes, but adapts existing rules to fit innovative instruments that can be used for payments, investment and more besides. Unlike securities prospectuses, for instance, crypto white papers can be published before regulators approve them. The framework also contains provisions to curb market abuse and insider dealing ‚Äì similar to guardrails set up for traditional finance.  While following common rules, national regulators will in practice do most of the enforcement, and EU states could compete to attract crypto business by doing so more slickly. A leading contender is currently France, which seems set on becoming a European hub for major firms like Binance and Circle.  Treatment of stablecoins  A sizable chunk of MiCA is dedicated to stablecoins, which are crypto tied to the value of other assets. Lawmakers wanted to cater to the perceived risks of the Meta-backed Libra currency, later renamed Diem, and saw their fears vindicated when the terraUSD stablecoin went haywire in 2022.  Stablecoins ‚Äì known in MiCA as ‚Äúe-money tokens‚Äù (EMTs) if linked to the value of a fiat currency, or ‚Äúasset-referenced tokens‚Äù (ARTs) otherwise ‚Äì will have to hold suitable reserves, and be well-governed.  Constraints get tougher the more widely the tokens are used: stablecoins not pegged to an EU currency will be outright banned from having over 1 million transactions per day, as lawmakers don‚Äôt want to see the euro supplanted. The rules also apply to Terra-style algorithmic stablecoins that seek to use automated coding to maintain value.  Incentives for the European crypto industry  The EU crypto industry has been broadly supportive of MiCA, but the potential costs of not meeting standards are high. Those deemed in noncompliance potentially face million-euro penalties that could be as high as 12.5% of annual turnover.  In return, licensed crypto providers get a ‚Äúpassport‚Äù to operate across a bloc of 450 million people.  They also get certainty about the rules of the game ‚Äì which some see as vital to persuade the legally cautious traditional finance (TradFi) sector to venture into crypto.  Controversy  Originally proposed by EU watchdogs in 2019 after a tide of initial coin offerings (ICOs) raised fears over fraud and manipulation, and then deliberated upon by governments and lawmakers over several years, MiCA‚Äôs journey still isn‚Äôt finished.  The law courted controversy during its passage, and there are still issues to iron out.  At one stage, lawmakers appeared to favor curbs on energy-intensive proof-of-work technology used by major cryptocurrencies. In the final draft, those measures ‚Äì which some characterized as an effective bitcoin ban ‚Äì were abandoned, though crypto firms must still disclose environmental impacts.  But there are still concerns over the final deal. Some worry curbs on dollar-denominated stablecoins could stop some decentralized finance applications in their tracks.  Whether it applies to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) also remains a gray area, and regulators may have to pore over individual tokens to judge if they‚Äôre unique or interchangeable.  It‚Äôs also an open question whether the EU will succeed in enforcing its rules against crypto firms overseas.  EU agencies the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Banking Authority (EBA) will have to fill in some of the details ‚Äì from designing application forms, to defining how stablecoin caps and environmental disclosures will work. They have already started consulting on some of those topics, with more to come.  Global impact  MiCA could have an impact beyond the EU‚Äôs borders. One reason is the ‚ÄúBrussels effect‚Äù: Multinational companies often prefer to operate a single set of standards, so pioneering EU rules in areas such as online data protection quickly become the global norm.  Legislators overseas may be inspired by the bloc‚Äôs crypto example. In early 2023, a bipartisan delegation of staffers from the U.S. Congress even visited Brussels to get some regulatory tips. Lawmakers and lobbyists in places like the U.K. and U.S. have argued the EU‚Äôs clear framework could attract business, and that they need their own laws to keep up.  The EU will encourage them, as it won‚Äôt want to be undercut by crypto havens. The European Commission‚Äôs Mairead McGuinness has said there‚Äôs ‚Äúno point‚Äù in the EU seeking to regulate a global sector if the rest of the world doesn‚Äôt follow suit.  Standards being set by international bodies such as the Financial Stability Board also appear influenced by, and largely compatible with, MiCA.  What‚Äôs next for crypto regulation in Europe?  MiCA applies as of Dec. 30, 2024, with stablecoin provisions taking effect six months earlier in June ‚Äì a hiatus designed to give industry and regulators time to prepare. But MiCA won‚Äôt be the final word.  Other EU laws also affect the crypto sector, dealing with issues like money laundering, tax avoidance, bank capital, cybersecurity and distributed ledger technology-based securities trading. Future laws could also use the regulatory categories MiCA creates as a point of reference.  By mid-2025, the commission will report on whether further laws are needed to cater for NFTs and decentralized finance, and the European Central Bank‚Äôs Chief Christine Lagarde has already called for a sequel to deal with crypto lending and staking.  Others argue that recent market turmoil shows the need for tougher rules. They have called to abandon the tailored approach of MiCA altogether, in favor of one more closely modeled on conventional securities.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/mica-eus-comprehensive-new-crypto-regulation-explained,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af2c6e26d00f60dfd633e618604d4cff535bb2e5-2031x1142.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419672,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFHyf,1694068751,$500B Korean Asset Manager Mirae Taps Polygon Labs in Securities Tokenization Drive,"Mirae Asset Securities, South Korea's largest financial group with over $500 billion in assets under management, said Thursday that it is working with Ethereum scaling platform Polygon Labs to advance tokenization within finance and boost adoption of Web3 technologies.  Polygon Labs will be a technical consultant in The Mirae Asset Security Token Working Group, which is working to create infrastructure to issue, exchange, and distribute tokenized securities, the asset manager said in the press release shared with CoinDesk.  The group includes several other companies, including Linger Studio and Coin Plug, and operates independently from Mirae, Hana Financial and SK Telecom's security token consortium, Next Finance Initiative (NFI).  ""Polygon Labs is a leading global blockchain technology development company that is innovating throughout all aspects of Web3. Through technical collaboration with Polygon Labs, Mirae Asset Securities aims to establish global leadership in the field of tokenized securities,"" Ahn In-sung, head of the digital assets division at Mirae Asset Securities, said.  Tokenization involves bringing real-world assets, such as real estate, bonds, fine art, and equities, as digital tokens on a blockchain.  Several traditional finance giants, including Franklin Templeton and Hamilton Lane, a top-tier investment firm with over $823.9 billion in assets under management, have already initiated tokenization projects on Polygon. The Monetary Authority of Singapore's experimental tokenization initiative, Project Guardian, executed foreign exchange and sovereign bond transactions on Polygon last year.  Per Boston Consulting Group and investment firm ADDX, asset tokenization, as a business opportunity, is likely to increase 50 times to $16.1 trillion by 2030, accounting for 10% of the global gross domestic product.
