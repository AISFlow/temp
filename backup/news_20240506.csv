According to a recent report by Messari, NEAR experienced significant increases in market capitalization, revenue, active addresses, and Total Value Locked (TVL), solidifying its position among the top players in the cryptocurrency market. NEAR Outperforms Bitcoin And Ethereum In Q1 2024, NEAR’s circulating market cap surged to $7.2 billion, marking a 94% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) increase. The fully diluted market cap also witnessed substantial growth, reaching $8.2 billion, representing a 91% QoQ increase. These numbers propelled NEAR to secure a spot among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Related Reading: Study Uncovers Surprising Data: 90% Of Stablecoin Transactions Not Driven By Human Users Notably, NEAR outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which recorded QoQ growth rates of 69% and 53%, respectively. Additionally, NEAR’s revenue, derived from network transaction fees, witnessed an 82% QoQ increase, reaching $1.9 million. NEAR continued its address growth trend in Q1 2024, with average daily active addresses reaching 1.2 million, representing a robust 42% QoQ increase. The network also witnessed a surge in daily new addresses, totaling 236,000 (a 37% QoQ increase), and surpassed the milestone of 100 million total accounts. According to Messari, contributions from established protocols like KAIKAINOW, Sweat, and Playember and the adoption of HOT Wallet, averaging over 350,000 daily active addresses in March and nearly 3 million total wallets, drove this expansion. Stablecoin Market Cap Soars In Q1 Per the report, the protocol experienced a sustained increase in transaction activity throughout Q1 2024, with daily transactions reaching 4.3 million, representing a 78% QoQ increase and a 538% increase over the last six months. Similarly, NEAR’s TVL witnessed substantial growth, ending the quarter at $335 million, a 163% increase from the previous quarter and a 547% increase over the last six months. Furthermore, NEAR’s decentralized exchange (DEX) volume experienced a notable surge, with an average daily volume of $8 million, representing a 95% QoQ increase. Ref Finance emerged as the leading DEX on the protocol, with $6 million daily volume, surpassing Orderly Network. Lastly, NEAR observed a significant increase in its stablecoin market cap during Q1 2024, soaring 176% QoQ to $214 million. Notably, USDT experienced a significant surge, with its market cap increasing by 1,155% QoQ, reaching $88 million. Outperforming Top 20 Cryptocurrencies Regarding price action, NEAR Protocol’s native token has exhibited strong performance, surpassing the top 20 cryptocurrencies in the market with a 9.4% uptrend in the past seven days. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has experienced a minor 1.5% price correction over the past 24 hours. This positive trend has enabled NEAR to reclaim the significant $7.40 price level, which is important for bullish investors. Looking ahead, the $7.60 mark may present a potential resistance level for the token, serving as a crucial barrier to monitoring. It could pave the way for a retest of the $8 mark, signaling further upward momentum if successfully breached.

26982303,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606754,1715029249,"Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Crypto Analyst Says Massive Surge Is Coming, Here’s The Target","Shiba Inu has rebounded by over 19% from its $0.00002081 price point at the beginning of the month. Current price action shows the cryptocurrency might be on its way to performing an interesting price surge in the coming weeks. According to one crypto analyst, SHIB could actually go on a 120% price surge after breaking out of the current consolidation. Crypto Analyst Says Massive Surge Coming SHIB kickstarted a price correction immediately after reaching 0.00003556 in early March. Bullish investor sentiment surrounding the meme cryptocurrency at the time quickly changed into a bearish one. This pushed SHIB on a decline that bottomed out at $0.00002117 in the middle of April, indicating a 40% price correction in those two months. Interestingly, this was the worst SHIB price decline since the May 2022 collapse of the Terra ecosystem. Related Reading: Why Did The Solana (SOL) Price Jump Today? As noted on the 8-hour timeframe chart shared on social media platform X by crypto analyst World Of Charts, SHIB has been on a consolidation channel for the past two months. However, the analyst foresees a bullish breakout to create a strong bullish wave that’s going to send SHIB holders on a profit margin between 100% and 120%. $Shib Consolidating In Bullish Flag In H8 Timeframe Incase Of Successful Breakout Expecting Solid Bullish Wave Expecting 100-120% Bullish Wave#Crypto #Shib pic.twitter.com/vfLClaexvu — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) May 3, 2024 Interestingly, a further look into the chart shared by World Of Charts shows that the analyst is open to a higher price surge over a longer period of time. The last price target indicated on the chart is $0.00009500, which is a 280% target from the current price levels. Can Shiba Inu Push Higher? Shiba Inu recently formed a higher low on the weekly timeframe, an indicator that the bulls might be starting to gain the upper hand. Despite the past decline, over 56% of SHIB holders remained in profit as many long-term holders opted to hold on to their tokens. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002489 and is up by 6.4% in the past seven days. This price increase has seen the number of SHIB holders in profit rising concurrently to 61%.

One catalyst that could lead to a further price increase is the recent partnership between PayPal and MoonPay which will allow PayPal users within the United States to buy the dog-themed cryptocurrency easily. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez also predicted a SHIB price surge based on a bull flag that has recently appeared on the token’s price chart.

Robinhood disclosed its crypto arm received warning from the SEC that could foreshadow enforcement action.  An Elliot Wave technician sets a $92,000 price target for bitcoin's next cycle high.  The crypto rally paused on Monday during U.S. trading hours with bitcoin {{BTC}} slipping back to near $63,300 as U.S. regulators ratcheted up pressure on crypto companies.  A move to above $65,000 early Monday quickly reversed and prices were pressured further after popular brokerage Robinhood (HOOD) disclosed its crypto arm received a Wells Notice over the weekend from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a move that often foreshadows an enforcement action against a company.  The pullback has been shallow, though, with most crypto assets firmly above last week's low. BTC declined 1.5% over the past 24 hours but was still up over 10% from Wednesday.  Alternative cryptocurrencies performed mixed, with ether {{ETH}}, dogecoin {{DOGE}}, shiba inu {{SHIB}} and layer-2 network Polygon's native token {{MATIC}} sinking 2%-3% during the day, while solana {{SOL}} and Ripple-adjacent XRP showed relative strength advancing 4%-6%. The broader market gauge CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) was down 0.3%.  Despite the halt in the rally, crypto hedge fund QCP Capital observed renewed demand for bitcoin call options for September with a strike prices of $75,000 and $100,000, underscoring the increased optimism that BTC will climb to higher prices over the next few months.  ""We are seeing some bullish follow-through in volatility and [funding] rates following the reversal bounce from Friday and into the weekend,"" crypto hedge fund QCP Capital said in a Monday market update.  Hong Kong ETF rumors  Perhaps fueling the quick recovery from last week's lows were rumors about broadening access to the newly listed Hong Kong spot bitcoin and ether ETFs for Chinese investors.  Richard Byworth, managing partner of Syzcapital, said in an X post that ""there's talk"" in Hong Kong about adding the crypto products to the so-called Stock Connect facility, which would allow qualified mainland Chinese investors to access eligible shares listed in Hong Kong.  In theory, the move would have a significant impact opening the floodgates of Chinese money seeking alternative assets amid the real estate and stock market rout.  However, Chinese investors have been barred from crypto ETFs and there wasn't any official communication about changing the rules.

John Glover, chief investment officer at crypto lender Ledn, said there's still possibility for a breakdown to lower prices before ending its correction from March's all-time high of $73,000.  ""Although the dip to $56,500 may have completed the correction, I still expect to see a price of $52-55,000 before wave 4 completes,"" Glover said, referring to the Elliot Wave theory, a technical analysis that assumes that asset prices move in repetitive wave patterns.  The theory alleges that price trends develop in five stages, of which waves 1, 3, and 5 are impulse waves representing the main trend, while waves 2 and 4 are retracements between the impulsive price action.

MicroStrategy is poised to be ""meaningfully higher"" at the end of the year, Lance Vitanza said.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} has significant upside potential this month thanks to two big catalysts and Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock could surge, too, on its way toward getting ""meaningfully higher"" by the end of the year, TD Cowen analyst Lance Vitanza said in a note Monday.  Last week, MicroStrategy reported a net operating loss of $53.1 million for the first quarter of 2024 after taking a digital asset impairment charge of $191.6 million. But the company hasn't adopted a new digital asset fair value accounting standard that would’ve given it a sizable profit from bitcoin’s rally at the beginning of the year.  Read more: FASB's Crypto Accounting Shakeup Could Lure More Corporate Investment, Michael Saylor and Others Argue  Vitanza, who attended MicroStrategy’s World 2024 user forum in Las Vegas last week, however, said customers had significant positive feedback regarding the firm’s legacy software business, founded long before Saylor pushed the company to purchase billions of dollars of bitcoin. “This is causing us to rethink the potential upside around the operating business,” he wrote.  The company’s stock, which is up 89% year-to-date, could also see meaningful upside due to two main catalysts that could drive up the price of bitcoin.  May 15 marks the deadline for institutional investment managers to file form 13-F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If more firms are shown to have purchased the newly approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds during the first quarter, this will show bitcoin has gained further institutional acceptance, the analyst said.  Vitanza said another event that could be positive for bitcoin and, thus, MicroStrategy, will be the SEC's likely rejection of an ether ETF, which many in the industry are girding for.  “This is significant because while Ethereum's fate may remain up in the air until 2025 or longer, we believe there's a substantial amount of capital waiting for a digital winner to be declared; to the extent Bitcoin proves to be that winner, the incremental demand would likely be felt even more acutely given the recent bitcoin halving,” Vitanza said.  Bitcoin is up 43% since the start of the year and reached a fresh all-time high above $73,000 in March, according to CoinDesk data.

The strong correction caused Bitcoin and the altcoins market to drop to levels not seen since February. While some sectors of the crypto community felt like the bull run was over or needed to “cool-off”, others seemed optimistic about the cycle’s future. Now that the market is back from the correction, analysts foresee that the altcoin season might come soon. Related Reading: Here’s When Bitcoin Could Peak In This Accelerated Bull Run: Analyst Is The Correction Phase Over? Over the weekend, crypto analyst and trader MilkybullCrypto shared with his X followers that the Altcoins market capitalization was at “an RSI level that initiates an explosive rally.” Per his chart, this level is a “reset for a healthy rally,” as seen in 2016 and 2020. During these two cycles, when the altcoins reached this level, a “huge rally” followed. The analyst shared his latest forecast on Monday after seeing the market strengthen its recovery. To Milkybull, the altcoins market cap finished a “Heatly retest.” The market displayed a similar correction during the 2020-2021 rally before skyrocketing to all-time high (ATH) levels. The chart seems to display the same performance, which could mean that altcoins are “in preparation for an explosive rally,” if history repeats itself. Altcoins resembling performance between cycles. Source: MilkybullCrypto Similarly, crypto trader and analyst Captain Fabik considers the “Healthy Correction is done.” In his X post, the analyst identified a bullish falling wedge pattern, which signals a “bullish rally incoming.” Altcoins “Cool-Off” Or “Euphoria” Incoming? According to analyst and trader Rekt Capital, the Altcoin market cap, excluding the top 10 cryptocurrencies, has “successfully retested the $250 billion level as a support level” over the last several weeks. Per the trader, the altcoins are following the proposed path of his “Ultimate Altcoin Market Cap Game Plan For The Coming Months.” On this plan, Rekt Capital forecasted altcoins market cap would surge to the $315 billion level before retracing back to the $250 billion mark. This retrace would be followed by an explosive surge above the $440 billion market capitalization. Altcoins have stayed above the $250 billion support zone despite the strong corrections, as seen in the chart below. To the analyst, this suggests the market is “now showing initial signs of trying to curl up from here.” Ultimate Altcoin Market Cap Game Plan For The Coming Months. Source: Rekt Capital Renowned figures have expressed their “disappointment” in altcoins’ performance this cycle. Altcoin Sherpa considers that “many alts didn’t even run that hard over the last few months,” which could suggest that it’s time for a “cool-off.” At the time, the analyst deemed altcoins’ rally was “done” for the next 1-4 months. However, others believe the “euphoria phase” for altcoins is coming. According to Crypto Yhodda, “The alts will rise again, and by the end of 2024, they will go crazy.” Moreover, the analyst believes that “Altcoins Cycle III” will give us some crazy pumps. According to his chart, the altcoins’ cycle I and II displayed a symmetrical triangle pattern before the breakout. The surge was followed by a slowdown before the upward trajectory continued, called “Round 1” by the analyst. Subsequently, the rally would repeat the pattern on a second round before reaching the cycle’s top. “Cycle III” appears to be in the middle of Round 1, which suggests to the analyst there is a long road ahead before it “hits the euphoria phase.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Reveals 6 Must-Buy Altcoins With The Most Potential Altcoins market capitalization sits at $1.045 trillion in the weekly-chart.

42390898,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPQCv,1715023652,The SEC Can’t Stop Suing Crypto Companies,"Robinhood is the latest firm to draw the ire of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This weekend, it reported receiving a Wells notice – an announcement that the securities watchdog is building a case and intends to sue. In an 8-K filing, the fintech firm revealed it received the letter from the SEC’s enforcement division for alleged securities violations.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  At this point, it’s hard to be surprised by the SEC’s anti-crypto actions – shameless though they may be. Apparently, the agency sent the notice after Robinhood cooperated with the SEC’s investigative subpoenas about its crypto operations. A Wells notice is essentially the last chance the accused has to convince regulators that it didn’t break the law, which would be a sign of good faith except that the vast majority of these letters end up in a lawsuit.  As Robinhood legal, compliance, and corporate lead Dan Gallagher noted in a statement, the firm has been in direct communication with the SEC over its crypto offerings for years, which is exactly what you’d expect from a firm that really only dabbles in crypto. It’s not clear from the letter which tokens are considered securities by the SEC, though it’s worth noting the brokerage proactively delisted a number of tokens — including Solana {{SOL}}, Polygon {{MATIC}} and Cardano {{ADA}} — in response to previous SEC lawsuits against rival trading firms.  “We firmly believe that the assets listed on our platform are not securities and we look forward to engaging with the SEC to make clear just how weak any case against Robinhood Crypto would be on both the facts and the law,” Gallagher said. He noted in particular the firm’s “years of good faith attempts to work with the SEC for regulatory clarity” and, like other crypto firms in legal limbo, “well-known attempt to ‘come in and register.’”  Further, in heeding “the SEC’s calls,” Robinhood attempted to register as a special purpose broker-dealer with the agency. While there are many licensed crypto firms, so far Prometheum Ember Capital, a trading company that doesn’t yet offer any assets to trade, is essentially alone in receiving a special purpose broker-dealer license, which were introduced in 2020 to allow firms to custody and transact in “crypto asset securities.”  While just speculation, I have a sense the SEC started to build a case right around the time Gallagher, himself a former SEC commissioner and securities law expert, testified before Congress that the SPBD process is irrevocably broken and a profound waste of resources. To wit:  “When Chair Gensler at the SEC in 2021 said, ‘Come in and register,’ we did,” Gallagher said in a June 2023 House Agriculture Committee crypto hearing. “We went through a 16-month process with the SEC staff trying to register [as] a special purpose broker-dealer. And then we were pretty summarily told in March that that process was over and we would not see any fruits of that effort.”  So, to sum up, the SEC announced intentions to sue a firm for failing to register for a license after seemingly denying the firm that very license (though to be accurate, the SPBD licenses are given out by self-regulatory organization FINRA).  This fits with a long pattern. Since coming into office in 2021, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has made it his business to rein in the crypto industry, which he says is under his remit (an arguable contention). These efforts dramatically increased in the wake of the collapse of FTX, which was particularly embarrassing for U.S. regulators given how cozy Sam Bankman-Fried was with them.  The SEC now spends a disproportionate amount of time and money pursuing legal challenges against crypto firms both large and small. The agency has filed at least one lawsuit per month since last November against a crypto company, the majority of which go unnoticed and typically end in a settlement.  “The SEC just sent a Wells notice to Robinhood. The number they've sent about crypto in recent months is astonishing. It's hard to imagine that they would (or could) bring so many enforcement actions at once,” Variant Fund legal lead Jake Chervinsky said on X. “It seems like they're abusing the Wells process as a scare tactic now.”  See also: Consensys, a Target for the SEC's Assault on ETH, Is Fighting Back | Opinion  In some sense, these lawsuits — particularly the ones brought against big name firms like Coinbase and Robinhood — are an attempt to signal that crypto is essentially lawless. This is not squarely the fault of the SEC, but also that Congress slept on crypto regulation for over a decade and is now hampered by partisan gridlock.  “I don’t know why [the SEC] did what they did. But there’s no going back on rules now,” Beau J. Baumann, a PhD. candidate at Yale Law School, and co-author of an influential crypto law paper, told CoinDesk in an interview. “In that sense, the whole thing is bad faith. If the enforcement actions are unlawful, writing a rule is way more obviously so.”  “Congress should enact new legislation to avoid legal pitfalls, but it’s unclear to me whether they actually will,” Baumann added. Gensler, for his part, has stated directly that he doesn’t think crypto needs bespoke legislation or guidance, given his view that everything crypto, bar bitcoin, walks and talks like securities.  While the SEC has had legal victories, it’s suffered many court losses as well. It remains to be seen whether Robinhood will actually get sued, and if so whether it goes the way of Coinbase and Consensys and mounts its own offensive legal campaign.  If there is a silver lining here, it’s that, after years of trying to eat the entire crypto pie, Gensler’s SEC may have bitten off more than it could chew.

Smart contract platforms, excluding Bitcoin, fell 28% on the month while trading volumes and on-chain revenues also declined sharply. Solana, which has been plagued by unreliable transaction processing due to arbitrage bot spam activity, seems to be nearing a fix to solve the congestion issues. Digital asset prices declined amid an oversupply of new alt-tokens, with Bitcoin posting its first negative return in eight months, and increased U.S. regulatory scrutiny on self-custody In April, March’s euphoria faded into a downward price grind for digital assets and produced Bitcoin’s first negative return in eight months (-14%) amid an over-supply of new alt-token supply, falling on-chain activity and a regulatory assault on self-custody by U.S. authorities. Smart contract platforms, excluding Bitcoin, fell 28% on the month while trading volumes and on-chain revenues also declined sharply. Altcoins bore the brunt of the mushy price action as the average return outside of ETH/BTC was -37% on the month. Many names like Starknet and Aptos fell by almost 50%. The story of the month can best be described as the cooling of speculative froth amid more troubling macro signals, a stagnation of user activity, and a worsening of the regulatory environment in the U.S. On the last point, note the following in April: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a Wells Notice to the Uniswap foundation, signaling the agency’s intent to bring a lawsuit against the DeFi giant, which Uniswap founder Hayden Adams promised to fight. The IRS ignored all industry comments and released a draft crypto reporting form that included reporting requirements for un-hosted wallets, which is unfeasible in many circumstances. The SEC amended its complaint against Justin Sun with arguments that he “traveled extensively” in the US between 2017 and 2019 while marketing and promoting certain tokens, signaling a possible escalation in agency efforts to hold him accountable. Consensys flipped the script on the SEC, suing the regulator in the favorable 5th circuit instead of allowing the SEC to bring a lawsuit first. Similar to the Coinbase lawsuit, this suit features William Savitt from Wachtell as lead counsel and appears to be part of a larger play to create a potential circuit split if the rulings differ from the Coinbase case in S.D.N.Y. (2nd Cir.), Binance case in D.D.C. (Fed. Cir.), or Kraken case in N.D.Cal . (9th Cir.). Media reports revealed that Gary Gensler now considers Ethereum a security despite calling the 2nd largest crypto asset a commodity while he taught at MIT and declining to answer direct questions from lawmakers on the issue. Samourai Wallet and associated Bitcoin mixing protocol developers were arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. The FBI issued a warning that users should avoid self-custody wallets that do not collect KYC information as they are likely operating illegal money-transmitting services. The DOJ updated its response in the Tornado Cash case, suggesting that even decentralized, non-custodial services need to implement KYC/AML and register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Again, this is not feasible for most open-source projects. All of the above suggests that the Biden administration is hurrying to make DeFi and self-custody functionally illegal in the United States before voters can express political intentions at the ballot box in November. We have already noticed a heightened correlation between bitcoin’s price action and Trump’s victory odds over the last 6 months. We think such a relationship may rise further over the next six months before the Supreme Court or legislators can definitively address these issues.

The crypto market buckled under the weight of April airdrops, with the majority of them quickly selling off post-launch. Notable airdrop duds include KMNO (-33%), REZ (-33%), W (-56%), PRCL (-33.4%), and SAGA (-54%). We count $9B of new circulating token supply and more than $70B to be unlocked/vested over the next 2-5 years, a considerable headwind to many token prices. Also, as we detail below, the granddaddy of all anticipated airdrops disappointed many stakeholders. That project is Eigenlayer, whose EIGEN token was finally announced, and though the token is still not tradeable, pre-launch markets point to an FDV of roughly $10B, which is as low as 1/3rd of what the most optimistic analysts were predicting. The most promising developing narrative is the Bitcoin Renaissance, but it is very early days here. The Bitcoin Renaissance and Runes Though BTC’s performance was anemic (-14%), network usage reached new record highs as transactions and on-chain revenue hit all-time record highs of ~927k and $81.6M on April 20th, the day after the halving. This activity was spawned by the bitcoin halving, but its genesis can be traced to the creation of new speculative assets on Bitcoin using “hacks” of Bitcoin’s core software. The latest iteration of these assets was Bitcoin Runes which is a standard for creating fungible tokens that is designed to succeed the BRC-20 standard. Runes are more efficient than BRC-20s because they employ a UTXO model that eliminates the Bitcoin network overhead inherent in BRC-20 tokens. Runes are called such because they are created and transferred using a Bitcoin software component in Bitcoin UTXOs called “Runestones.” Runestones allow tokens to be minted on Bitcoin with a name as well as other rules such as minting ability and total supply of tokens. BRC-20s and Runes represent attempts by Bitcoin core developers to solve the long-term network security issues facing Bitcoin. The Bitcoin network has a “security budget” that is derived from the economic value miners receive for securing the network. This economic value that miners earn is the combination of network transaction fees as well as inflationary rewards minted for producing Bitcoin blocks. Unless the price of Bitcoin continues its parabolic trajectory, the security budget of miners will decrease alongside the BTC emissions. The path to stemming a declining security budget is to increase transaction revenues to the BTC network. Though some BTC maximalists believe BTC should only be used to store and transact BTC, there is a significant minority amongst the core developers who want to change Bitcoin to spur transaction growth. A shift in the Bitcoin community is occurring, and it's uncertain if we will see another return to the community feuds of the past. Bitcoin Layer-2 Blockchains Beyond trying to create a larger security budget through transaction revenue, the other core reason for BTC Layer-2 Blockchains ((L2 S )) to exist is to give BTC holders the ability to use their stagnant BTC to earn yield. After the disastrous BTC lending market collapse and the billions in BTC lost in 2022, many entities with large amounts of BTC have been looking to utilize their idle capital. Though BTC Eden tracks only 18 projects, we track over 50+ projects. The definition of Bitcoin L2s is a bit more nuanced and flexible than L2s for Ethereum. While there is great nuance even for Ethereum L2s, they typically rely upon Ethereum for settling their state differences (the changes in everyone’s token balances and smart contract additions/updates). Often Ethereum L2s also post the compressed transaction data to Ethereum to prove state differences. Bitcoin L2s, however, typically begin with a bridge that connects each chain to Bitcoin. This bridge acts as a value transport layer that locks BTC and mints a representation of that BTC on the L2. Some projects are building their own bridges from scratch, while others are relying upon existing, proven bridges like tBTC and Interlay. There are many competing designs for Bitcoin L2s. In its current form, Bitcoin is designed as neither a settlement layer nor a data availability layer – both constructs are necessary for there to be a true L2 roll-up to Bitcoin. The result is a myriad of approaches, including “merged mining,” “sidechains,” the evolution towards a “roll-up,” and even more exotic approaches to security. In some cases, Bitcoin L2s adopt more than one of these approaches simultaneously in order to secure their blockchains. Merged mining involves miner pools opting into “mining” a blockchain alongside Bitcoin. This typically involves submitting proof of work for two or more blockchains. A current example of this is Rootstock . Another type of Bitcoin L2 is the “side-chain,” which is most often secured by a separate group of non-Bitcoin miners, a Proof of Stake validator set, or a federation of Bitcoin/native token holders. The ultimate Bitcoin L2, however, is one that is a roll-up. A roll-up is a blockchain that settles its state transitions and/or proofs of that transition to a host blockchain alongside the data to prove that the state transition is valid. Additionally, the current crop of bridges relies upon trusting other parties through a multi-signature approach. This means that a group of people hold key shards that, when combined with some majority of signers, allow for the unlock of “bridged” BTC. Though it is early, most of the Bitcoin L2s have additional/flimsier trust assumptions than most Ethereum L2s. However, this reality will change once the BitVM, an open-source Bitcoin virtual machine, is launched. Though it is roughly 12-18 months from becoming implemented on Bitcoin, BitVM promises to enable Turing-complete logic to allow for Bitcoin smart contracts. Though the smart contracts themselves would not be on Bitcoin but instead on other blockchains, BitVM will allow Bitcoin to act as a settlement and verification layer for Bitcoin roll-ups and trust-minimized bridging. The follow on to BitVM, BitVM v2, will allow for data to be stored on Bitcoin that will enable BTC L2s to become complete roll-ups. Ethereum Re-Staking Game and Eigenlayer Eigenlayer TVL ((USD)) Continues to Levitate Source: Defillama as of 4/30/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. In our past monthly reviews, we discussed the re-staking game that was being created to facilitate Eigenlayer, which promised to be the next “new thing” for Ethereum. Eigenlayer was premised on the notion that lots of service businesses could exist off of the Ethereum blockchain and still rely upon the economic value of ETH to secure their services. Many people outside of crypto are somewhat baffled by the necessity to secure a business using ETH. This is because most off-chain businesses rely upon legal recourse to business agreement violations as well as reputational damage from poor business dealings. In the permissionless blockchain world, it is very difficult to rely upon the rule of law or reputation because other parties are often anonymous or may reside in countries with flimsy legal systems. In blockchain, cryptography, and consensus, as well as computer code, act as guarantees to ensure businesses are transacted according to immutable rules. However, many businesses necessitate additional trust beyond what is available on Ethereum or rely upon processes that would be too expensive to conduct on the blockchain. The result is that a number of interesting businesses that would be palatable to blockchain users do not exist. Eigenlayer was developed to allow ETH holders to lend out their ETH as economic bonds in exchange for yield, allowing these complex but useful businesses to gain users due to an economic bond. This economic bond would also act as a form of recompense if a business agreement was not executed properly. Eigenlayer emerged as the darling of the Ethereum ecosystem because it promised not only a new way to gain yield on Ethereum, but also allow new businesses and services to exist for Ethereum users. Cynically, it also meant that investors would have new projects to invest in, dreams to sell, and tokens to dump. A large ecosystem cropped up around “re-staking” ETH, as a number of on-chain protocols, to give users tokens in exchange for enabling them to spin up Eigenlayer-centric businesses. Since Eigenlayer is premised on allowing users to stake ETH to back businesses, it opened up its vaults as a marketing ploy to allow users to deposit funds before its functionality officially launched. To spur users to supply their ETH, they promised that users would earn points which would correspond to an allocation of $EIGEN tokens when Eigenlayer officially launches. Additionally, the “re-staking” businesses that would operate Eigenlayer validators to verify the transactions promised to give users each an allocation of their tokens as well. Thus, two tiers of entities cropped up that each promised value to Eigenlayer users. But the sum of that value to be given to users was never confirmed. To great fanfare, users allocated over 5M ETH worth north of $15B into Eigenlayer, giving it the second highest TVL of any crypto application in just under 10 months. Many anticipated that the “yield” from “farming” Eigenlayer points as well as the re-staked tokens would result in astronomical yields—some estimating as high as 100%+ returns from simply locking up ETH. However, cracks in this speculative furor appeared early as the liquid re-staking token for Renzo, ezETH, de-pegged from its approximate ETH value. ezETH, like other liquid staking tokens, should have a bedrock value that is close to ETH because its swappable for ETH once withdrawals are enabled. But, as holders of ezETH cannot withdraw ETH from Renzo’s staking contract yet, ezETH’s price is subject to the laws of supply and demand. More risk-tolerant users seemed to forget this reality and sought to leverage their ezETH points farming by borrowing heavily against their ezETH position on borrow/lend platforms. After Renzo protocol released the distribution schedule of their $REZ token, users were very disappointed, and they sold their ezETH for ETH. This resulted in the price dropping below the liquidation level and caused a cascade of liquidation that caused ezETH to drop in price from ~$3150 to as low as $~800. Eigenlayer finally launched its token on April 29, and to many, it was a massive flop. Early users received 5% of total supply rather than the 10-20% many anticipated, and the tokens are unclaimable for an unspecified period of time. Eigenlayer also blocked anyone who resides in the US and many other countries from claiming their tokens. Though the token has not officially begun trading, early estimates project that the FDV of $EIGEN tokens will be around $10B which is much less than the $30B that many were anticipating. The ETH-BTC ratio made a three-year low on April 13th. Altcoin News Solana, which has been plagued by unreliable transaction processing due to arbitrage bot spam activity, seems to be nearing a fix to solve the congestion issues. Anza, a Solana software-focused developer team, has deployed a testnet upgrade that will provide a stop-gap measure to the network issues until a more permanent solution is developed. Cosmos, who has been very quiet over the past few months, announced a strong update to its business functionality called interchain security. In the latest iteration, Cosmos announced that it intends to move to partial set security which allows some validators to opt in to security provision. This is an improvement that allows validators to pick and choose which consumer chains they secure to avoid allocating resources to unsafe or low-profit chains. Meanwhile, Avalanche demonstrated a successful test of its Hyper SDK, a software development kit that allows anyone to create blockchains. The test demonstrated a blazing-fast 100k TPS in a globally distributed node set up with 50 nodes. Avalanche also announced an integration with Stripe for Fiat-to-Crypto onboarding as well as an Amazon Ink partnership for deploying blockchains, called Subnets, on its network. In the Ethereum L2 landscape, Arbitrum released the BOLD upgrade on its testnet, which allows anyone to submit fraud proofs to Ethereum for Arbitrum activity. This is a substantial upgrade and the first permissionless implementation of fraud proofs which helps decentralize Arbitrum. Scroll, an emerging zero-knowledge ((ZK)) Ethereum L2 blockchain, joined the legion of projects offering points for desired user activity. In Scroll’s case, it is offering points for users who deploy capital to Scroll’s chain. Another interesting development is the announcement by Hashkey, a Hong Kong based financial services group, to create its own zk L2 blockchain. Though price action was relatively dire, stablecoin data has proven a bit more encouraging. While stablecoin transfer volume continues to reach highs not seen since 2021, the 30-day moving average of daily active addresses reached its all-time high in April 2024 with 1.66M addresses. Stablecoin Daily Active Addresses Reach All-Time Highs Source: Artemis XYZ as of 4/30/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein April’s Notable Leader GNO (-14%) Gnosis Ranks Lowest in Daily Active Addresses Amongst Comparable Blockchains Source: Artemis XYZ as of 4/30/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Gnosis is an Ethereum sidechain that calls itself a “sister” chain to Ethereum. As such, it is an Ethereum-compatible blockchain with its own validator set that implements much of the same software architecture of Ethereum. Gnosis acts as an Ethereum infrastructure layer as it creates popular products such as CoW Swap, Gnosis Safe, the Open Ethereum Client. Additionally, Gnosis has focused on some cutting-edge use cases in payments, called Gnosis Pay , which created the first permissionless debit card that links directly to an on-chain wallet. An interesting dynamic of the Gnosis chain is that gas for on-chain activities is paid for using xDAI, a stablecoin, while the GNO token is used for staking Gnosis’s beacon chain and for governance of Gnosis chain as well as the Gnosis DAO’s Treasury. Gnosis also runs a venture arm to incubate projects that will ultimately benefit the Gnosis chain. Most recently, Gnosis has spun out both CoW Swap (a DEX that is designed to save users gas on swaps) and Safe Protocol (a non-custodial treasury wallet used by many crypto projects that secures >$100B in assets). In a March 2024 blog post, Gnosis announced that it intends to use the DAO treasury to fund and foster projects to drive value to tokenholders. Gnosis’s most audacious venture is Gnosis Wallet, which is assembling a full-state, mobile-first bank that integrates Gnosis Safe, Gnosis Pay, CoW Swap, and other applications native to the Gnosis chain. The main catalyst for Gnosis in April was the passage of GIP-98, which funds the investment of GnosisDAO into a project called HOPR to create a VPN service called GnosisVPN. News of the quorum being reached to pass GIP-98 catalyzed a ~20% increase in GNO price over the next few days. The price exuberance in April is due not only to the potential of GnosisVPN, but also to future investments using DAO funds that mirror the success of CoW Swap ($220 FDV) and SAFE ($1.75B FDV). April’s Notable Laggard APT (-52%) Aptos Generates 7.5% of the Revenue Per User of Sui Source: Artemis XYZ as of 4/30/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. The price action of April was unkind to Aptos as its APT token lost (-52%) after a very auspicious March when it increased (+44%). On-chain activity reflected a plummeting lack of interest in Aptos as it lost the most on-chain revenue (-54%), month to month, of any chain outside of Ethereum. While Ethereum and its ecosystem of L2s have a logical reason for why revenues declined, the cost of blockspace decreased massively due to Blob Space, Aptos does not. Aptos has a lot to offer from the standpoint of developer experience and blockchain technology. Aptos is a successor to the Facebook Diem project and its blockchain-optimized, rust-based, Move language. The move is billed as being substantially more developer-friendly than existing blockchain smart contract languages such as Move and Rust. In practice, developers claim that using Move has decreased development time by as much as 80%. The move is also claimed to be a safer language than other general-purpose blockchain languages. Aptos implements Move and utilizes a derivative of an optimistic transaction processing system called the AptosBFT that is claimed to reach 100k TPS. It also has a large war chest of funds as it has raised more than $350M to fund its development and its ecosystem. Despite its high potential, Aptos has not been able to achieve meaningful adoption. Currently, Aptos is second to last in terms of fee revenue, averaging around $3.5K per day. For context, this places it behind the Cosmos Hub, which does not have any smart contract functionality and whose only source of fee revenues is users transacting between wallets or unstaking tokens. While Aptos has a respectable amount of daily active users, ~115K in April, it hosts a Lilliputian amount of DEX volumes. Aptos DEX volumes are the fourth worst among projects we track, ~ $16M per day in April, which ranks it in the same tier as Starknet, Near, Fantom, and Scroll.

26977200,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606745,1715022003,Bitcoin Repeating Bull Cycle Trend From 8 Years Back: Analyst,"Well-known cryptocurrency analyst and trader Rekt Capital has revealed an intriguing finding regarding Bitcoin’s price trend in a recent analysis. His ground-breaking prognosis reveals that the crypto asset is mirroring historical price action that took place during a bull cycle eight years ago. Similar Historical Price Tendency In Bitcoin Rekt Capital asserted that the way Bitcoin is reiterating a past price trend from a cycle 8 years ago is amazing. Given the magnitude of the 2016 bull cycle, BTC could be poised for significant growth in the upcoming months. During the 2016 bull cycle, BTC witnessed a notable growth of nearly 3,000%, following the conclusion of the Bitcoin Halving event. Related Reading: Here’s When Bitcoin Could Peak In This Accelerated Bull Run: Analyst Moving on, Rekt Capital drew attention to his previous post regarding Bitcoin’s post-Halving movement, which he dubbed the Post-Halving Danger Zone. According to the analyst, the digital asset is currently caught up in this zone. He further noted that Bitcoin has veered to the negative below the current Re-Accumulation Range Low, repeating the pattern that began in 2016. In 2016, the move below the re-accumulation range was about 17%. However, this divergence in 2024 is down by 6%. Rekt Capital previously affirms in 2016, about 21 days after the Halving, Bitcoin saw a lengthy -11% decline before transitioning toward the upside. Thus, if there should be downside volatility in this cycle around the Re-Accumulation Range Low, 2016 data indicates that BTC could turn to the upside in the next 10 days, considering the post time. Even though the Post-Halving “Danger Zone” ends in the upcoming days, particularly four days from now, Rekt Capital stated that 2016 data proves that there may be some negative volatility at the $60,600 Range Low in the interim. Pre-Halving Danger Zone For BTC Notably, the expert also identified a Danger Zone before the event, where previous Pre-Halving retraces have always started. According to Rekt Capital, pre-Halving retracements have historically been seen in Bitcoin between 14 and 28 days before the event, and this cycle hasn’t been any different thus far. Related Reading: Bitcoin Loses Historical Level, Analyst Says “Reclaim And Bounce, Or Die” He stated that Bitcoin saw its first pre-Halving retrace of -18% about 30 days before the Halving, while in 2016, the pre-Halving retrace started 28 days before the event, suggesting BTC could move in the same direction as that of 2016. Due to this, Rekt Capital is confident that a potential danger zone could occur after Halving. However, the retracement from the current all-time high has now proven to be deeper and longer than past retracements, spanning several weeks. Consequently, the expert predicted a high probability that Bitcoin prices may have reached a bottom. At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin was seeing a positive sentiment, rising by 0.43% to $64,126 in the past day. Both its market cap and trading volume have increased by 0.50% and 24.43%, respectively, in the last 24 hours.

26973502,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606753,1715016648,"Crypto Whale Spends $10.4 Million On PEPE, Do They Know Something You Don’t?","A crypto whale’s transaction involving the third-largest meme coin by market cap, PEPE, has drawn the crypto community’s attention. The magnitude of the transaction, coupled with some other whale transactions, suggests that it may be high time to pay more attention to PEPE. Crypto Whale Spends $10.4 Million On PEPE On-chain analytics platform Spotonchain revealed a wallet (3eAaAC3C9) that had purchased 1.238 trillion PEPE from Binance at an average price of $0.000008424 ($10.4 million). This wallet then proceeded to withdraw the tokens in two transactions. On-chain data shows that the whale withdrew 322.5 billion PEPE in the first transaction and the remaining 915.85 billion PEPE in the second transaction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Relative Strength Jumps To 40%: 10x Research Reveals Next Steps From Here At the time of writing, the whale hasn’t moved the tokens, suggesting they may be looking to hold for the long term. Some notable smart traders look to have been accumulating the meme coin lately, most likely in anticipation of significant price moves from it. Spotonchain also recently revealed two whales that had withdrawn 660.7 billion PEPE from Binance and MEXC. The platform also mentioned another whale that withdrew 322.48 billion PEPE ($2.68 million) from Binance for the first time. More recently, Spotonchain drew the crypto community’s attention to a smart trader who has been profiting from the meme coin since last year. This trader is said to have completed 8 trades and realized a cumulative profit of $917,000. Seeing how PEPE has performed since the start of the year, these whales’ interest in the meme coin isn’t surprising. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that PEPE has made a year-to-date (YTD) gain of over 500%, and this bullish momentum looks to be far from over. Interestingly, many traders have yet to jump on the the wave, as just over 200,000 persons hold the meme coin. Price To Hit New All-time High (ATH) Soon Crypto analyst Plazma recently suggested that PEPE could soon hit a new all-time high. PEPE’s current ATH is at $0.00001074, with the meme coin trading just 20% below this price level. Crypto analyst Yazan also hinted that meme coin would soon hit a new all-time high, asking his followers if they were ready for this to happen. Related Reading: Cardano Comeback: Analyst Reveals Why It’s Time To Get Back Into ADA PEPE is currently ranked as the thirtieth largest crypto token by market cap and is likely to climb higher if it eventually hits a new ATH. Crypto analyst and trader Murad believes that the meme coin could rise to the top 10 crypto tokens by market cap since he predicted that PEPE could flip Shiba Inu (SHIB) and possibly Dogecoin (DOGE). At the time of writing, the meme coin is trading at around $0.000008615, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42390884,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPPNd,1715012854,Allison Duettmann: How Blockchains Can Make AI Safer,"If you’re curious about emerging tech, it’s harder to imagine a cooler job than Allison Duettmann’s. She’s the CEO of the Foresight Institute, a think tank founded in 1986 that’s devoted to advancing science and tech that’s arguably undervalued — fields like nanotechnology, space exploration, and harnessing cryptography to build safer AI.  Allison Duettmann is speaker on the AI Stage at Consensus 2024, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.  Duettmann lives in the world of Big Future Ideas. She’s the coauthor of “Gaming the Future: Technologies for Intelligent Voluntary Cooperation”; she’s the founder of Existential Hope (with a mission of “Thinking Big for Positive Futures”); and she’ll be joining Consensus 2024 at the inaugural AI Summit to share insights on what’s legitimately useful in the world of AI+Crypto, and what’s just hype.  In a recent Zoom interview, we cover the staggering upside of nanotechnology, dig into how crypto could help the development of AI, and we may have accidentally just birthed a billion-dollar token.  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  Let’s start with a curveball. With some tech that seems important to you, but doesn’t get a lot of press: Nanotechnology. If we crack the code of nanotech, what’s an example of a use case? How would the world be different?  Allison Duettmann: Basically, it would revolutionize the entire way in which we produce things. So, yes, individual applications are exciting. But more generally, it’s almost like we’re still producing things in this super stone-agey way. We take the resources we have and try and strap them together.  But if we could get much more precise [through nanotech] about what types of resources we use in the production process… Like, currently, we’re operating at an entirely wrong level. We’re producing so much waste in the process of producing.  Imagine a 3D-printing method, for example, but on a tiny molecular scale. So you’d have massive gains on that front. Nanotech could have really interesting implications on hardware for computing, and really interesting applications in longevity technology.  How so?  For cryonics, for example, you need almost molecular nanotechnology for the revival of patients — such as on the drug delivery level or the nanobots in your bloodstream perspective. Then there’s also innovation from an environmental perspective; carbon drawdown would be enabled through molecular nanotechnology, or waste removal in the biosphere.  Given the massive upside, why hasn’t there been more development in nanotech?  One thing that's so interesting about nanotech is that for any one individual application, there's probably an easier way to do it. But if we had this kind of general purpose, high throughput nanotechnology, then you could be using that for many different fields.  So there's never one incentive to develop it for an individual actor. That’s why progress has been so slow. It’s almost like this public good that once it’s created, it can cause these revolutions across different industries. But for any individual application, there's never a unique inventive to develop it.  That’s so interesting. I say this only mostly in jest… it sounds like a good candidate for a crypto project. Because it’s something that might take a huge crowd to capitalize, with the benefits conferred to a larger community. Is there a NANO token?!  Well…  If not, let’s start one, Allison!  Yes, now that we’ve said it, the Nano DAO.  [Both laugh.]  No, but I think in all seriousness, it fits really well. There are many people in the Foresight community that are also in crypto and care a bunch about nano. A lot of the early sci-fi nano ideas fit really well with the philosophy of crypto.  Okay let’s talk about crypto and AI. What do you see as the most promising, legitimate ways that blockchain can help with the development of safer or better AI?  I guess I would say there are three buckets. One would be the security side of things, where the Web3/crypto space has a lot of experience with failing fast if you don't have secure systems built.  Because many of the systems in the permissionless or immutable spaces — if you don't build them correctly — there may be a million-dollar bounty attached to them. So I think this spirit of building safety and having an almost unintentional vetting process is an important mindset, as we build up AI systems.  And the second?  The second one is on the side of, how can we leverage technologies that the crypto space is also working on, to build AI systems that we would want from a human perspective?  Can you give an example?  So, there may be more privacy-preserving applications that are possible as we draw more on the cryptography spaces. They may enable us to produce better applications, for example, for human health and in finance, leveraging cryptographic technologies. And we may be able to use cryptographic technologies to help us create better, very advanced AI systems.  And what’s the third and final bucket?  The governance side of AI. So, you can possibly use cryptographic technologies to prove that you’re following certain safety benchmarks or standards. Rather than having to share all of the information that is possibly proprietary, you can only share information that is needed to prove you’re hitting certain safety benchmarks.  Great, and I know we’ll unpack all of this more at the AI Summit. Speaking of, what are you most looking forward to at Consensus this year?  I’m really looking forward to discovering what the state of crypto and AI has really come to at this point. I come at it from the foundational research side of things or more on the kind of cryptography and security side of things. But I also know that many people have been really building hard in the Web3 and AI space. So, I'm really interested to see which of my hypotheses — or which of other people's hypotheses — have come out. Who's building what right now? And where are there possible synergies across different products? I’m excited to see what’s happening in that space.  You and me both.

Bitcoin Open Interest Is Now Less Than 2% Of The Market Cap As explained by analyst James Van Straten in a new post on X, the derivatives side of the market has looked “extremely healthy” while BTC’s latest recovery has occurred. The metric of interest here is the “Open Interest,” which keeps track of the total amount of derivatives-based Bitcoin positions that are currently open on all centralized exchanges. Related Reading: XRP Forms On-Chain Signal That Led To 16% Crash Last Time When the value of this indicator goes up, it means that the investors are opening up more positions on the market right now. Generally, the total leverage in the market rises when such a trend takes place, so the price of the asset could end up turning more volatile following it. On the other hand, a decline in the metric suggests users are either closing up their positions of their own volition or getting forcibly liquidated by their platform. The cryptocurrency may behave in a more stable manner following such a decrease. Now, here here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest over the past few years: The value of the metric seems to have been going down in recent days | Source: @jvs_btc on X In the graph, the Open Interest is displayed as a percentage of the asset’s market cap (that is, the total valuation of the entire BTC circulating supply at the current spot price). It would appear that the indicator has registered a drawdown recently and has slipped under the 2% mark. This would suggest that the positions on the derivatives market now make up for less than 2% of the market cap. From the chart, it’s visible that the metric had earlier spiked to a high as the coin’s rally towards a new all-time high had taken place. Interestingly, the market cap was rapidly going up in this rally, but this ratio was still trending up, implying that speculation had been growing at a rate faster than the price. This may have been a sign that the derivatives side was starting to become overheated. In the drawdown that had followed the price top, the investors had started getting liquidated, leading to the ratio registering a decline. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Cardano “Ready For A Parabolic Bull Run,” Here’s Why The most recent price drop had helped reset the market further, bringing the ratio down to levels not seen since February. Bitcoin has been mounting a recovery effort in the past few days, but so far, the derivatives market has remained cool. “Hard to be bearish here,” says the analyst. It now remains to be seen if the health of the market would continue to look optimistic in the coming days, thus potentially allowing for the recovery to go a step further.

42390883,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPPIV,1715010505,"Jack Dorsey Leaves BlueSky Board, Touts 'Freedom Technology' of X and Nostr","Jack Dorsey has stepped away from the board of directors of social media startup BlueSky.  On Saturday, the former Twitter CEO called upon his followers to use ""freedom technology"" such as X as well as open source protocol Nostr.  Dorsey announced his backing of BlueSky in December 2019 in an effort to decentralize social media.  Former Twitter CEO turned crypto entrepreneur as well as CEO of payments firm Block (SQ), Jack Dorsey is no longer a board member at BlueSky, the social network startup that he started backing in 2019 in an effort to decentralize social media.  Dorsey, in a post on X on Saturday called upon his followers to use “freedom technology” such as X, and to not depend on corporations “to grant you rights.” He said something very similar on Nostr, the open source protocol aimed at enabling a fully decentralized, censorship-resistant social media experience, where he's been very active in past weeks and to which in 2022 he donated 14 bitcoin (worth about $245,000 at the time) to the protocol's founder.  One year later, Dorsey donated $10 million to OpenSats, a non-profit organization for free and open-source bitcoin projects, like Nostr.  When asked if he was still on the board of BlueSky following his post, Dorsey said “no.”  “We sincerely thank Jack for his help funding and initiating the bluesky project,” the company wrote in a post on Saturday. It is now looking for a new board member to replace Dorsey.  In Dec 2019, Dorsey announced that Twitter, which he then led as its CEO, was funding a small independent team to develop an “open and decentralized standard for social media,” which Twitter would ultimately follow as well.  “New technologies have emerged to make a decentralized approach more viable,” he said back then. “Blockchain points to a series of decentralized solutions for open and durable hosting, governance, and even monetization. Much work to be done, but the fundamentals are there.”  The social networking service, which launched to the public in February, is led by CEO Jay Graber, a software engineer and entrepreneur.  The ascension of Nostr over the past couple of years, though, essentially obviated the need for BlueSky.

26967584,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606752,1715007647,Here’s Why This Crypto Analyst Believes Bitcoin Is At A ‘Prime Buy Zone’,"Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has revealed that it may still be an excellent time to accumulate Bitcoin. This comes amidst the flagship crypto’s recent price recovery, with the crypto token skyrocketing above $64,000. Bitcoin Is Still In A “Prime Buy Zone” Martinez mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) 90-day ratio indicates that it is still in a “prime buy zone” despite its recent price surge from $57,000 to $64,000. The MVRV is a metric used to determine whether a crypto token is undervalued or overvalued. Related Reading: Cardano Comeback: Analyst Reveals Why It’s Time To Get Back Into ADA Source: X Based on Martinez’s findings, Bitcoin looks to be currently undervalued, which presents a good opportunity to accumulate the crypto token. The analyst’s revelation undoubtedly provides reassurance for those who failed to buy the dip and are looking for a perfect entry to invest in Bitcoin. Interestingly, Bitcoin whales didn’t waste time accumulating during Bitcoin’s recent decline, as Bitcoinist reported that these investors bought 47,500 BTC ($2.8 billion) between May 2 and 3. However, the MVRV ratio being at that level suggests that many of these whales are investors adding to their positions, meaning that significant buying pressure shouldn’t be expected anytime soon. Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe also recently suggested that Bitcoin is still undervalued. He noted that the crypto token is back above $60,000, and retail isn’t here yet. He mentioned in another X post that these retail investors won’t return until the summer, which means that everyone currently positioning themselves is still early. BTC Almost Ready For Next Leg Up Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto recently hinted that Bitcoin is almost ready for another parabolic rally. He stated that Bitcoin’s local bottom is in considering that the “next liquidity grab interest is above.” He added that Bitcoin will first “clear out the $67,000 level and consolidate in preparation for the $73,000 level. Related Reading: Fantom Revival: Crypto Analyst Predicts A Jump To $1.2 For FTM Price Source: X Meanwhile, the analyst revealed in another X post that Bitcoin has “finally experienced a MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence) bullish cross” on the daily chart, just like it did in January 2024, which led to the crypto token rising to as high as $73,000 in March. According to Mikybull Crypto, Bitcoin reclaiming above the 50-day Moving Average will “further confirm the bullish continuation.” For those looking to long Bitcoin, Mikybull Crypto remarked that the $64,000 range is an “ideal zone” to do so. He predicts that Bitcoin might clear out the CME gap between $62,580 and $64,105 before consolidating at around $64,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $65,300, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42390890,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPPXt,1715004396,‘AI-Agents Will Do Crypto Transactions’: Arif Khan on the Future of Crypto-AI,"It seems like the buzzy world of “Crypto + AI” has sprung from nothing in the past 12 months, but don’t tell that to Arif Khan, CEO of Alethea AI. He’s been here since 2017, when he was part of the core team of SingularityNET, one of the OG AI+Web3 projects. (It was around before even Web3 was called Web3.)  For Khan, decentralized AI is more than hype and more than abstract and more than a fashionable trend — it’s critical and it’s the future. And it can make our daily lives easier. ""I think in five years, we will have autonomous on-chain AI agents doing crypto transactions, and managing a large part of our lives,"" predicts Khan. ""In 5 to 10 years, managing our financial life, our emails, and the administrative hassle of things like paying bills. That can be done on-chain and natively.""  Arif Khan, CEO of Alethea AI, is a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.  In the lead-up to Consensus, where he’s speaking on the AI Stage, Khan shares his vision of how Alethea will help unlock that future, why decentralized AI is so important, and why at Consensus it’s “fun to hang out with the editorial team and the journalists.” (This last might deserve a fact-check, but we appreciate the sentiment.)  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  What’s your vision for Alethea?  Arif Khan: Our primary goal is to build Web3 infrastructure for generative AI. Imagine a Venn diagram with two circles — the Web3 world and the AI world. [ARIF shares his screen on our Zoom to show the below image.] The Web3 world is a scarcity-oriented world, and the generative AI world is all about abundance. So it’s at the intersection of combining these two things where you get what we call the AI protocol, where any generative assets — whether it’s an AI character or AI agent — is tracked, it’s monetized. There’s a provenance around it.  Can you give an example?  We did our first collaboration way before ChatGPT was popular, when GPT-3 was still in private beta. We created a character or an AI agent, version 0.1, let's say. We called it Alice, who’s an intelligent NFT. An NFT that can talk to you, learn, interact, and communicate.  So this is a work of art, but at the same time, you're able to interact and communicate with it. So, it's no longer a static image, it has an AI component. We've come a long way since then, but the goal is to build this out in a way that's ethical and open, and that’s going to be really important.  In five years, we will have autonomous on-chain AI agents doing crypto transactions, and managing a large part of our lives  Why is decentralized AI so important to you? What does Web3 bring to the table?  One of the principles around Web3 is ownership. You know the meme: Not your keys, not your coins. So it’s very straightforward to map that out and look at it from an AI standpoint: If it's not your data, not your models, not your input, and if you’re not part of the equation, it’s not yours.  If you can bake ownership into the design structure of what you're building, then you're sort of reversing the power dynamic. And that means, for example, at a very, very basic level, it means if you are a creator, if you own an asset, or if you own aspects of your words — and if you've licensed it out, or it's part of a chain of provenance, you are now part of an equation where for anything that's trained on it, you get some level of compensation down the line. This is very complex to do at scale.  Is it fair to say that the output of an Alethea model might be similar to the output of something centralized, like OpenAI, but the foundation is very different and done in a decentralized way, which confers benefits that are harder to see on the surface?  I think you’re directionally correct, but I will just zoom in [and correct] one area. I was an early angel investor in the team that created Stable Diffusion. And it was a quantum leap for the open source approach. It was the only model at the time that could compete against DALL-E, a commercial model built by a larger company. It could punch way above its weight class. It was built by the open-source community and open-source researchers.  What I’m trying to say is that at every single level, whether it's at the GPU level, whether it's at the model level, whether it's at the agent level — at every single level, if you bake in decentralization and an open ethos, you get tremendous opportunity to innovate. You are not stuck by centralized control.  Ah, so if I hear you right, you’re saying that if you decentralize, you’re actually more likely to get a better output?  Yeah. And the word “likely” to yield better outputs is crucial, because you’ll see a lot of open source failures regularly.  Open-source is hard!  Yeah, it’s hard. But that’s part and parcel of the process. You get some terrible outputs along with great outputs.  What can you tell us about Alethea’s partnership with Amazon Web Services?  So, there are three parts to our ecosystem. There's the GPU clusters, there's the model side, and then there’s the agents.  On the GPU side, we've started working with different providers to diversify the GPU access. And AWS has been a very helpful partner in helping us test and scale out these GPUs. We continue to diversify our GPU sources and it's been an opportunity to learn from an awesome team as well.  Give us an AI prediction. How could the world look differently thanks to AI in, say, five years? Or 10?  I think in five years, we will have autonomous on-chain AI agents doing crypto transactions, and managing a large part of our lives. In 5 to ten years, managing our financial life, our emails, and the administrative hassle of things like paying bills. That can be done on-chain and natively.  Two-parter: What excites you most about AI, and what terrifies you most about AI?  What excites me most is the democratizing potential of it, like the opportunity for each and every one of us to have our own AI agent.  What terrifies me is that with this comes tremendous responsibility, right? Fire can heat the household, or it can burn a village down. So we just have to be careful with how we use it.  Outside of Alethea and Singularity, what do you view as the most promising projects in Crypto + AI?  Morpheus is a very interesting open-source project. I really like the way they're positioning themselves. And the other one that's been very interesting to look at is Bittensor. From an application standpoint, they've created a really interesting economy, where people can plug in to the application layer, to the GPU layer, to the model layer. And I'm sure there are many others I'm missing; there are so many awesome entrepreneurs and community builders.  Let’s close with some thoughts on Consensus. Any favorite memories from past conferences?  I remember meeting Michael Casey six or seven years ago at Consensus in New York, at some after-dinner event. And there was a physicist or mathematician — Eric Weinstein, who’s quite popular on Joe Rogan now. And he was riffing on stats and making some controversial point. It was like this melding of minds, and it was so awesome to be in the presence of thinkers who are really pushing the frontiers.  Favorite parties or events at Consensus?  There are so many, but I think it's always fun to hang out with the editorial team and the journalists.  Why thank you!  It's a really good fun bunch of people. So I try to follow them wherever they're going. They're going to the Cool Kids Party, right?  I’ve never been mistaken for a Cool Kid, but we’ll take it. Thanks and see you in Austin!",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | BITTENSOR | AGX,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/05/06/ai-agents-will-do-crypto-transactions-arif-khan-on-the-future-of-crypto-ai,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a03ebdb92e5c6817d07aa985a56ef9776773af23-300x300.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

26965005,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606748,1715004026,Study Uncovers Surprising Data: 90% Of Stablecoin Transactions Not Driven By Human Users,"In a recent report by Bloomberg, it has been revealed that more than 90% of stablecoin transaction volumes do not originate from genuine users, according to a new metric co-developed by Visa. Stablecoin Market Faces Data Reality Visa and Allium Labs have created a dashboard designed to filter out transactions initiated by bots and large-scale traders to isolate those made by real individuals. Out of approximately $2.2 trillion in total transactions recorded in April, a mere $149 billion was identified as “organic payments activity” by Visa. The data challenges the optimistic outlook of stablecoin proponents who believe these tokens can transform the $150 trillion payments industry. Related Reading: 900 Million Telegram Users Send TON Token Soaring 15% – Details Fintech giants such as PayPal Inc. and Stripe Inc. have been exploring stablecoins, with Stripe co-founder John Collison expressing bullishness on the tokens due to “technical improvements.” Pranav Sood, the executive general manager for EMEA at payments platform Airwallex, commented on the findings: “It says that stablecoins are still in a very nascent moment in their evolution as a payment instrument.” Sood emphasized the need to focus on increasing existing payment infrastructure in the short and mid-term while acknowledging the long-term potential of stablecoins. Accurately tracking crypto activity’s “real” value using blockchain data has always been challenging. Glassnode, a data provider, estimates that the record $3 trillion assigned to digital tokens at the bull market’s peak in 2021 was closer to $875 billion. Analysts Predict Massive Surge Ahead According to Bloomberg, the nature of stablecoin transactions often leads to double-counting, depending on the platform users employ for fund transfers. For example, converting $100 of Circle’s USDC stablecoin to PayPal’s PYUSD on the decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap would result in $200 of total stablecoin volume being recorded on-chain. Visa, which processed over $12 trillion the previous year, could suffer if stablecoins gain widespread acceptance as payment. Interestingly, despite this troubling data, analysts at Bernstein predicted that the total value of all stablecoins in circulation could reach $2.8 trillion by 2028, nearly 18 times their current combined circulation. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Reveals 6 Must-Buy Altcoins With The Most Potential While PayPal and Stripe have made strides in adopting stablecoins, Airwallex has observed limited demand for stablecoin-based payment solutions among its customers, primarily due to concerns about “user-friendliness.” Sood emphasized the significant barrier of overcoming entrenched payment methods, citing the continued use of checks for 40% to 60% of business payments in the United States. The Bloomberg report sheds light on the dominance of non-genuine user activity in stablecoin transactions. The study underscores the importance of improving existing payment infrastructure and addressing user-friendly concerns to unlock the long-term potential of stablecoins.

42390891,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPPi9,1715001251,Popular Crypto Wallet MetaMask Rolls Out 'Smart Transactions' to Combat Ethereum Front-Running,"MetaMask, the most popular crypto wallet for Ethereum, is rolling out a new feature this week designed to help users avoid the consequences of maximal extractable value, or MEV.  The optional new feature, called Smart Transactions, will allow users to submit transactions to a ""virtual mempool"" before they are officially cemented on-chain. According to Consensys, the company behind MetaMask, the virtual mempool will protect against certain kinds of MEV strategies, and it will run behind-the-scenes simulations of transactions to help users get lower fees.  MEV is extra profit that blockchain operators can extract from users by previewing or re-ordering transactions before they are written to the network, sometimes likened to the unsavory practice of front-running orders in traditional financial markets. MEV has a major impact on how Ethereum operates – boosting prices for users, slowing down transaction speeds, and even causing transactions to fail under certain network conditions.  ""There's $400 million every year that are being wasted on reverting transactions, stuck transactions, and just very obviously predatory MEV front-running and sandwich attacks,"" Jason Linehan, director of the Special Mechanisms Group division of Consensys, said in an interview.  ""Everyone agrees it's a huge problem,"" said Linehan. ""From a user experience perspective, the idea that you pay for a transaction that does nothing, that's, like, nonsensical.""  MetaMask's solution – its virtual mempool – bears some resemblance to a private mempool, which has become an increasingly popular strategy for ensuring transaction privacy and protecting against MEV. It's the platform's first step in a much more ambitious roadmap, which CoinDesk reported on earlier this year, to radically shift how MetaMask routes transactions to Ethereum under the hood.  Read more: MetaMask's Secret Project Could Shake Up How Ethereum Works  Private mempool services can sometimes raise centralization concerns since they allow middlemen to touch transactions before they are published to Ethereum. Consensys insists its virtual mempool is different, and is necessary for addressing Ethereum's large hidden costs.  ""We're not going to try to take over Ethereum or something,"" said Linehan, ""but there's no way that this becomes the base layer for the future of the global economy if it's wasting $400 million of its users' money every year on things that literally do nothing for them. That's pure waste.""  How 'Smart Transactions' works  When a user tells a blockchain wallet to submit a transaction to a chain like Ethereum, they are typically sending that transaction to a public mempool – a waiting area for yet-to-be-confirmed transactions operated by a decentralized network of bots and traders. ""Block builders"" and ""searchers"" work together to assemble transactions into bundles, called blocks, which eventually get written to the blockchain's digital ledger.  Builders and searchers scour the mempool for profitable trading opportunities and will sometimes re-order transactions or squeeze their own trades into blocks to extract an extra profit for themselves. This phenomenon, ""maximal extractable value,"" can sometimes lead to higher costs, failed transactions and slow-downs for everyday blockchain users.  Metamask will leverage some of these same operators – builders and searchers – to power its virtual mempool. Unlike on Ethereum's public mempool, the virtual mempool's builders and searchers will be financially penalized if they fail to execute transactions at the prices quoted by MetaMask to users.  Linehan says ""95%"" of the builders and searchers that currently operate Ethereum have already opted into its virtual mempool program, which will begin rolling out in phases over the course of this week. A more limited version of the tech, ""Smart Swaps,"" has already been available for several months.  The size of MetaMask's virtual mempool network – combined with its transparent inner workings and novel incentive scheme – makes it wholly unique from conventional private mempools, said Linehan.  In addition to ensuring better prices for users, Linehan says that the Smart Transactions feature will make it easier for users to track the progress of their transactions directly from within MetaMask – something that typically would've required users to visit a separate ""block explorer"" website like Etherscan.  Linehan describes Smart Transactions as a ""concrete first step,"" towards MetaMask's grander vision. ""It establishes the rails along which we might in the future start to build some of these other interesting use cases that people have buzzed about, like intent-based architectures.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/05/06/popular-crypto-wallet-metamask-rolls-out-smart-transactions-to-combat-ethereum-front-running,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/30ff7e2b75f1136b889c961514cf551f06489bf6-533x300.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Wells Notices are preliminary warnings informing companies that the SEC believes it has enough information to bring an enforcement action against a company, and usually lead to such actions by the regulator.  The company said that the potential action from the agency may include ""a civil injunctive action, public administrative proceeding, and/or a cease-and-desist proceeding and may seek remedies that include an injunction, a cease-and-desist order, disgorgement, pre-judgment interest, civil money penalties, and censure, revocation and limitations on activities.""  Previously, Robinhood ended support for Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC) and Solana (SOL) on June 27 – the three tokens that were named as securities in the SEC lawsuits brought against Binance and Coinbase.

Prominent analyst World of Chart has identified a bullish technical pattern that could propel AVAX prices significantly higher in the coming days. Related Reading: PEPE Primed For A Big Leap: 80% Price Increase Incoming? Falling Wedge Pattern Hints At Upside World of Chart points to the presence of a “falling wedge” pattern on AVAX’s price chart. This pattern typically forms during a consolidation phase, with price action confined between two converging trendlines that slope downwards. $Avax Forming Falling Wedge Incase Of Breakout Expecting Upside Continuation Successful Breakout Can Lead Massive Rally In Coming Days#Crypto #Avax pic.twitter.com/YJHJYarrSw — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) May 5, 2024 The key aspect of this pattern lies in the diminishing price range within the wedge, suggesting a buildup of buying pressure. A breakout from the upper trendline is often interpreted as a bullish signal, indicating a potential reversal of the downtrend and the start of a price surge. Avalanche Poised For Takeoff? AVAX might see a significant upswing if it is able to break above the upper trendline of the falling wedge, according to World of Chart. Following the breakout, there may be a substantial price increase as a result of this ascent, which would confirm the bullish formation. The expert draws attention to the possibility of significant momentum and an explosive upward advance. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView The possibility of an AVAX breakout has ignited discussions and speculation among crypto investors and traders, particularly those who actively follow technical analysis. Related Reading: XRP Holders Stack Coins Despite Price Dip: Bullish Signal Or HODL Of Desperation? Investor Caution Advised Despite Bullish Outlook While the potential for a bullish breakout is high, World of Chart emphasizes the inherent volatility and uncertainty of the cryptocurrency market.

Technical Indicators Paint A Positive Picture Beyond the falling wedge pattern, other technical indicators seem to be adding weight to the bullish narrative for AVAX. The recent price increase of over 16% in a single week suggests a potential shift in investor sentiment. Additionally, the impressive surge in trading volume signifies heightened market activity and growing investor interest in AVAX.

42418317,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTdC5V,1714998864,"Elon Musk Will Likely Remain Tesla CEO, and Tweet Non-Stop: Prediction Markets","This week in prediction markets  All eyes on Musk’s tweets – and his future as Tesla CEO  Trump’s chance of a conviction are higher than his polling numbers  CFTC meeting to discuss potential ban on political betting  Tesla was the first company to scale electric vehicles and bring them to the mainstream.  There have been challenges along the way, and Tesla’s critics say its founder Elon Musk is an impediment to its success with his erraticism and obsession with posting on his social media platform X, formerly Twitter.  Now, Tesla faces an existential threat. Sales and profits are falling, competition is increasing, particularly from China, and drastic cost-cutting measures include staff reductions and simplified car builds. As Tesla struggles with market pressures, leadership and strategic challenges persist, raising concerns about the company's direction and stability.  Nevertheless, the market thinks Musk will likely stay on.  On Kalshi, the regulated U.S. prediction market platform, ""yes"" shares in ""Elon Musk out as Tesla CEO this year?"" are trading at 12 cents, meaning bettors are giving a 12% chance of a change in leadership by Dec. 31. Each share pays out $1 if the prediction comes true, and zero if not.  At the same time, Tesla deliveries look to be stable, the market believes, and there’s a 52% chance the company will ship over 400,000 vehicles this quarter, an increase over the “disaster,"" per analysts, of the last quarter when it only shipped around 386,000.  Meanwhile, nothing is going to get between Musk and his X account.  On Polymarket, the crypto-based prediction market that operates everywhere except the U.S., bettors are predicting that he’ll tweet (excuse us, post) 75 to 104 times from May 3 to May 10, with outlier money predicting it’ll go all the way to 120.  If only there were a way to correlate Musk tweets to the performance of his companies the same way his tweets send memecoins to the moon.  Trump Faces Likely Conviction  Former U.S. President Donald Trump faces four legal battles as he runs for re-election, and the market thinks he will almost certainly be convicted before election day – but likely not spend any time in prison.  Currently, Trump is on trial for 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal a hush-money payment made to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election, allegedly to protect his presidential campaign from scandal.  Aside from that, Trump faces court cases involving allegations he conspired to overturn the 2020 election results related to the Jan. 6 riot on Capitol Hill, mishandling of classified documents, and a racketeering case in Georgia involving a phone call to the state's top election official to ""find 11,780 votes.""  For anyone else, this would be an extraordinarily serious situation that would certainly result in jail time, but this is Teflon Don we are talking about.  Currently, Polymarket bettors give a 76% chance that Trump will be convicted before election day.  This is up from 57% in late March when the contract was initiated, and Trump’s hush money trial kicked off.  But will he spend any time behind bars? Probably not – which puts the market in alignment with legal experts – though bettors have slowly changed their position on this, ever so slightly.  Right now, there’s a 17% chance the former President will spend any time incarcerated prior to Election Day.  The outcome of the various charges Trump faces range from fines, probation, to the possibility of significant jail time specifically for the mishandling of classified documents and the RICO charges brought in Georgia. Prison time, legal experts have written, is going to be a last resort considering the logistical challenges and the implications of incarcerating a former president who might also be an election candidate.  But will any of this benefit incumbent president Joe Biden?  Probably not.  On Polymarket’s general election contract – which currently has over $120 million bet – Trump’s chances have edged up over the last week to 47% from 44% while Biden’s have remained flat.  CFTC Meeting to Discuss Political Betting  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is set to meet on May 10 to discuss a potential rulemaking forbidding political bets.  The U.S. regulator is in the midst of a lawsuit involving Kalshi, which is suing the CFTC for rejecting its proposal to list derivatives that allow betting on elections. This legal battle follows a precedent set by Clarke v. CFTC, where the Fifth Circuit Court ruled against the CFTC's revocation of U.S. election betting site PredictIt's no-action letter, potentially influencing the outcome for Kalshi and its efforts to establish large-scale political betting markets in the U.S.  Given that the U.S. is about to enter into a hotly contested and acrimonious election, Kalshi and other platforms have a big interest in being able to operate prediction markets legally stateside. Looking at the massive amount of money parked in Polymarket’s election contracts – which has crossed the $120 million mark – it is clear this is something the market wants.  Pollsters were critically wrong about the 2016 election and 2020 elections, when they significantly undercounted the Trump vote. They also got the 2022 red wave wrong. Given the size of the Polymarket pot – perhaps larger than the revenue a polling firm brings in every year – one would think there will be a degree of accuracy not yet seen in prior elections.  But presumably this money is not American, because Polymarket is not allowed to serve U.S. persons under a settlement with the CFTC. Would the numbers look different if it were a Kalshi contract?

Crypto Market Outlook And Asset Selection Strategy Wacy’s recent thread underscores the anticipation of a massive altseason: “Only ~15% of altcoins will bring 10-100x in this hyper growth. Asset selection matters more than ever. One slip-up, and you’re out.” His analysis highlights the potentially selective nature of the upcoming market phase, suggesting significant disparities in performance among altcoins. Wacy believes the market is currently undervalued and primed for a significant uptick. He suggests that the consolidation of the total altcoin market cap above $700 billion would confirm the bull trend, signaling the onset of altseason. This perspective is rooted in current market behaviors where sentiment remains largely bearish, presenting a contrarian opportunity for growth. He categorizes the current sentiment into three types of capitulation—price, time, and growth—indicating varied investor behaviors that often precede market recoveries. The prevailing fear of further drops, according to Wacy, will likely clear out weak hands, setting the stage for a supercycle driven by Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) and subsequent strong buying activities. Related Reading: Buy Crypto In May, Go Away: Arthur Hayes Shares His Top Altcoin Picks Top 6 Altcoins With The Most Potential #1 And #2: WIF as well as PEPE are the memecoins highlighted by Wacy as potential early movers in the anticipated altseason. “Look at WIF and PEPE, structurally similar to DOGE during its meteoric rise. These coins have cultivated a community and meme appeal that could very well parallel SHIB’s market cap in the previous cycle,” Wacy asserts. He notes that PEPE appears particularly poised for a breakout, whereas WIF, though currently weaker, has the potential for quick shifts in market sentiment. #3 Ondo Finance (ONDO): This Real World Asset (RWA) focused coin is characterized by its robust buy support during price dips. Wacy sees ONDO as an undervalued asset with a significant upside. “ONDO has a resilient buy floor; even slight retractions to around $0.64 could offer lucrative entry points ahead of substantial upward trajectories,” he advises. His first target is the $1.62 price zone. #4 Arweave (AR): Known for its decentralized data storage solutions, Arweave is praised by Wacy for its strong market structure and resilience during downturns. Moreover, Arweave is building AO, a decentralized computer network which can be run from anywhere. “Arweave isn’t just storage; it’s a foundational technology in a decentralized future. A consolidation above $49 would likely be the catalyst for an explosive growth phase,” he predicts. Related Reading: Why This Crypto Bull Run Might Not Live Up To The Past: Analyst #5 Echelon (PRIME): Wacy discusses PRIME’s multifaceted ecosystem, which encompasses a trading card game and an AI-powered game, both of which are gaining traction. “Echelon stands at the confluence of gaming and blockchain technology, attracting a broad audience with its innovative gameplay and decentralized features,” he remarks. From a technical analysis perspective, the PRIME price is near a favorable buying zone from $14.97 to $17.5. “Hoping that altcoins are already entering the altseason, would like to see a V-shaped reversal,” Wacy states. #6 Ethena (ENA): This synthetic dollar protocol offers an alternative to traditional banking and is poised for growth. “Ethena’s pattern on the weekly charts typically precedes major price movements. With the next major unlock event slated for April 2025, the buildup could be substantial,” Wacy explains. He likens ENA’s current price trajectory with the one of SEI. Strategic Profit-Taking Wacy also provides strategic advice on profit-taking, anticipating that the altcoin market index, TOTAL3, could ascend to between $2 trillion and $2.3 trillion during the altseason. He suggests considering partial profit-taking once the market reaches approximately $1.6 trillion. His rationale is based on historical patterns where many investors fall prey to greed, resulting in substantial losses. The analyst further advises preparing a profit-taking strategy in advance, advocating for the reservation of 10-15% of positions for potential further growth beyond initial targets. He warns that the last surge in a growth phase often triggers excessive greed, suggesting that recognizing such signals could be crucial for timely exits before the onset of bear market conditions. At press time, WIF traded at $3.58.

42418297,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTdBmv,1714992980,"Australian Court Hands Win to Market Regulator in Case Against Qoin Blockchain, But There is a Catch","A court in Australia mostly ruled in favor of Australia’s markets regulator in its case against BPS Financial Pty Ltd (BPS) over its Qoin scheme.  The court clarified that blockchain was not part of the financial product.  An Australian Federal Court mostly ruled in favor of Australia’s markets regulator in its case against BPS Financial Pty Ltd (BPS) over its Qoin scheme, on Friday, court documents and the regulator’s announcement show.  Judge J Downes ruled that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) “succeeded on its Unlicensed Conduct Case, other than in relation to the period during which BPS was an authorized representative of PNI Financial Services Pty Ltd,” who hold a non-cash payments license. That period was 10 months long, ASIC said.  In 2022, ASIC sued BPS, asking the court to rule that the entire Qoin project, the token, blockchain, and wallet, was a financial product that required a license.  In Australia, ASIC has seen both victories and losses as it ramps up regulatory oversight through legal processes.  Part of this case was ASIC's allegation that the Qoin Blockchain and the Qoin Wallets constituted one single scheme, but the court disagreed.  ""Contrary to ASIC’s submissions, the Qoin Blockchain, a means of acquiring Qoin and a means whereby business operators who hold Qoin Wallets can register as Qoin Merchants are not components of, and are not themselves, the mechanism which allows the user to make the non-cash payment,"" the order said.  Experts said the court made an important rejection of ASIC’s attempts to have an entire blockchain found to be part of a ""financial product"" under Australian law.  “This is an important judicial recognition of blockchains as foundational technology where the use of the technology if it breaches the law, can (and should) be prosecuted, but the technology itself stands separate,"" said Blockchain Australia Chair and Digital Assets Lawyer Michael Bacina.  The order asked ASIC and BPS to confer and agree on a form of an order that would resolve the remaining questions, including penalties for later this month.

26953784,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606675,1714987849,900 Million Telegram Users Send TON Token Soaring 15% – Details,"Telegram, the messaging giant, has reached a staggering 900 million users. This surge directly impacts Telegram Open Network (TON), the blockchain designed to work seamlessly within Telegram. TON has seen a remarkable 15% growth in the last week, highlighting its potential to become a mainstream crypto player. TON price action. Source: Coingecko TON: Cheap Transactions Draw In Users The key to TON’s recent success lies in its tight integration with Telegram. Users can ditch the hassle of separate crypto wallets and make transactions directly through Telegram’s native wallet.

This frictionless experience, coupled with TON’s cheap transactions and fee-free USDT transfers, is a major draw for everyday users who might be hesitant to dive into the complexities of traditional crypto exchanges. Gm 💎 Telegram hits 900M Monthly Active Users, Gm back if you are one of them. pic.twitter.com/B6AlwEK71B — TON 💎 (@ton_blockchain) May 5, 2024 Farming In Your Chats While TON facilitates everyday transactions, its goals extend further. The Telegram ecosystem thrives on a network of apps and bots that introduce inventive ways to interact with your wallet. A prime example is “farming,” which allows users to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities using TON or other tokens, all within the familiar Telegram interface. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.323 trillion. Chart: TradingView This functionality to “farm” directly within chat windows showcases how TON fosters a deeper integration with cryptocurrencies. It breaks down the barriers between messaging and finance, potentially leading to a more seamless adoption of crypto in our daily digital interactions. Security Concerns However, TON’s path to mainstream adoption isn’t paved with roses. The biggest thorn in its side is security. While the integrated wallet offers undeniable convenience for small transactions, security experts raise concerns about its suitability for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency. TON weekly price ascent. Source: Coingecko Unlike traditional hardware wallets, which are considered the gold standard for secure crypto storage, Telegram’s software wallet might be more susceptible to hacks or breaches. This could be a significant deterrent for users wary of entrusting their hard-earned crypto to a messaging app. Regulatory Tightrope Another looming challenge for TON is the ever-evolving regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies. Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to handle these digital assets, and regulations can significantly impact how TON operates within different markets.

26950725,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606655,1714983328,Here’s When Bitcoin Could Peak In This Accelerated Bull Run: Analyst,"The current Bitcoin price behavior and its deviations from expected cyclical patterns remain a central theme of analysis. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) recently shared new insights on X concerning Bitcoin’s potential peak during the ongoing bull run, which is progressing at an atypical pace compared to historical data. When Will Bitcoin Peak This Cycle? In a detailed post, Rekt Capital pointed out that as of mid-March 2024, Bitcoin had not only reached new all-time highs but had done so approximately 260 days ahead of its traditional halving-induced cycles. This marked a significant acceleration. “When Bitcoin rallied to new All Time Highs in mid-March 2024, Bitcoin was accelerating in its cycle by 260 days compared to traditional Halving Cycles,” stated Rekt Capital. However, this rapid pace has not been sustained. Over the past two months, Bitcoin has been in a phase of consolidation, which has altered its trajectory. The acceleration advantage has decreased to about 210 days compared to previous cycles. This deceleration is a critical factor, as it could lead to a re-synchronization with the typical halving cycle. Typically, BTC peaks 518-546 days after a halving event. Related Reading: Bitcoin Relative Strength Jumps To 40%: 10x Research Reveals Next Steps From Here The analyst suggests shifting the predictive focus from just halving events to the periods after Bitcoin surpasses its previous all-time highs. Historically, BTC price tends to reach a bull market top within 266 to 315 days after breaking these thresholds. Given that this milestone was achieved again in mid-March 2024, the projected window for the next bull market peak could be set between late November 2024 and late January 2025. Nevertheless, a notable trend is the increasing duration for which Bitcoin maintains levels beyond its old highs. In 2013, this period lasted 268 days, in 2017 it extended to 280 days, and by 2021, it had increased to 315 days. This pattern suggests an incremental extension of approximately 14 to 35 days per cycle. “Historically, the amount of days that Bitcoin has spent beyond old All Time Highs has increased by approximately 14 days to 35 days,” explained Rekt Capital. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom In? Retracement From $73,800 Is Deeper And Took Longer To Form Adding these increments to the initial range of 266 to 315 days post-old highs, the peak could potentially extend to between 280 and 350 days post-breakout. This adjustment shifts the expected peak time frame to between mid-December 2024 and early March 2025. Potential Synchronization With Halving Cycles Despite the current accelerated cycle, there remains a possibility that further deceleration could align Bitcoin more closely with its halving cycle. In past cycles, such as those between 2015-2017 and 2019-2021, Bitcoin peaked at 518 and 546 days post-halving, respectively. If Bitcoin’s rate of acceleration continues to decrease, the cycle may eventually resynchronize, potentially delaying the peak to between mid-September and mid-October 2025. Rekt Capital elaborates, “But if Bitcoin continues to reduce its current acceleration in the cycle, it would resynchronize with traditional Halving cycles.” This could result in a peak more aligned with historical patterns, diverging from the current accelerated timeline. At press time, BTC traded at $64,262.

This achievement has ignited a celebratory mood among proponents, who hail it as a testament to the digital currency’s growing legitimacy and potential. However, beneath the champagne toasts, whispers of caution linger as analysts grapple with the true significance of this benchmark. Related Reading: Is MATIC Poised For Takeoff? Key Area Breaks Records, Fueling Bullish Outlook Bitcoin’s Blockchain Bonanza: Security And Speed Take Center Stage At the heart of the celebration lies the accomplishment itself. Bitcoin’s decentralized network, often touted for its security, has demonstrably facilitated 1 billion transactions – a testament to its ability to function flawlessly at scale. This feat, based on data by Clark Moody, is particularly noteworthy when compared to established payment giants like Visa, which took roughly 25 years to reach the same milestone. Proponents like Tarik Sammour emphasize this achievement, highlighting that “Bitcoin has done so flawlessly, securely, and without any centralized intermediary,” a stark contrast to the traditional financial system. What’s amazing is not that the #Bitcoin network has now processed 1B transactions, but that it has done so flawlessly, securely, and without any centralised intermediary. https://t.co/XC09H5bO6u — Tarik Sammour (@tarik_sammour) May 6, 2024 Bitcoin Vs. The Goliaths: Can Crypto Really Compete? The celebratory mood extends to Bitcoin’s potential as a viable payments platform. Analysts point to the rapid growth of Bitcoin compared to established players like Visa and Mastercard. Founder of the Orange Pill App, Matteo Pallegrini, emphasizes this point, underscoring Bitcoin’s resilience despite facing giants with “billions of dollars in marketing spend and thousands of employees.” This comparison fuels the narrative that Bitcoin is disrupting the payments landscape, offering a faster and more transparent alternative. A screenshot of Bitcoin Network's transactions and BTC price performance. Source: Clark Moody. A Look Beyond The Billion: Challenges On The Horizon While the celebratory chorus is loud, a closer look reveals some lingering concerns. Bitcoin grapples with scalability issues, struggling to handle the high transaction volume necessary to truly compete with traditional payment processors. This often translates to high transaction fees, potentially hindering broader adoption. Furthermore, the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, which relies on vast amounts of energy, remains a significant point of contention. Bitcoin is now trading at $64.244. Chart: TradingView The Verdict: A Toast With Reservations The 1 billion transaction milestone undoubtedly marks a significant moment for Bitcoin. It underscores the growing popularity and potential of this digital currency. However, a balanced perspective recognizes the challenges Bitcoin faces – scalability, transaction fees, and environmental concerns.

Out of about $2.2 trillion in total transactions in April, just $149 billion originated from “organic payments activity.""  Less than 10% of stablecoin transaction volumes are organic or come from real people, according to new findings by Visa and data platform Allium Labs, Bloomberg reported.  Out of about $2.2 trillion in total transactions in April, just $149 billion originated from “organic payments activity,” the report said. The analysis removed transactions done by bots and large-scale traders to “isolate those made by real people.”  The stablecoin market supply currently stands at about $150 billion, with tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) dominating the market with shares of 75% and 22%, respectively, broker Bernstein has said.  Stablecoins are a cryptocurrency tied to another asset class, usually the U.S. dollar, to keep a stable, steady value. They’ve come into sharp focus after PayPal and some others announced they were issuing their stablecoins. Legislation to regulate stablecoins is also seen to be the most likely to make it through the U.S. Congress.  ""There is also a lot of noise in this data given that blockchains are general purpose networks where stablecoins can be used across a range of use cases with transactions that can be initiated manually by an end user or programmatically through bots,"" said a note last month about the findings by Cuy Sheffield, Visa’s Head of Crypto.  Despite the discrepancy between total transfer volume and bot-adjusted transfer volume, the analysis found a steady growth of monthly active stablecoin users, with 27.5 million monthly active users across all chains.

Avalanche could rise further if there is a clear move above the $40.00 resistance zone. AVAX price is moving higher from the $30.50 support zone against the US dollar. The price is trading above $35.00 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $34.00 on the 4-hour chart of the AVAX/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it stays above the $36.30 and $35.50 support levels. AVAX Price Aims Higher After a steady decline, Avalanche’s AVAX found support near the $30.50 zone. A low was formed near $30.58, and the price started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price gained over 10% and broke many hurdles near $35.00. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $34.00 on the 4-hour chart of the AVAX/USD pair. The pair even cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $39.83 swing high to the $30.58 low. AVAX price is now trading above $36.50 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $37.65 zone or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $39.83 swing high to the $30.58 low. Source: AVAXUSD on TradingView.com The next major resistance is forming near the $39.80 zone. If there is an upside break above the $39.80 level, the price could surge over 10%. In the stated case, the price could rise steadily toward the $42.50 level or even $44.00. Dips Supported in Avalanche? If AVAX price fails to continue higher above the $37.65 or $39.80 levels, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $36.30 level. The main support is near the $35.20 zone and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). A downside break below the $35.20 level could open the doors for a major decline towards $32.80.

ETH is now above the 100-hourly simple moving average and facing hurdles. Ethereum found support at $2,820 and started a recovery wave. The price is trading above $3,100 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,110 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $3,165 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Holds Ground Ethereum price remained stable and started a recovery wave above the $3,000 level, like Bitcoin. ETH was able to clear the $3,050 and $3,120 resistance levels. However, the bears were active near the $3,165 resistance zone. A high was formed at $3,168 and the price started a downside correction. There was a minor move below the $3,150 level. The price is now stable above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,813 swing low to the $3,168 high. Ethereum is also above $3,100 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,110 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com Immediate resistance is near the $3,165 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,200 level. The next key resistance sits at $3,250, above which the price might gain traction and rise toward the $3,350 level. If the bulls remain in action and push the price above $3,350, there could be a drift toward the $3,500 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $3,620 resistance zone. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,165 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,100 level and the trend line. The first major support is near the $3,000 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,813 swing low to the $3,168 high. The main support is near the $2,940 level.
