42383539,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9wsEd,1587422031,Big Tech Signs Rare Open Source Pledge to Boost Supplies During COVID-19,"As pressure mounts to reopen closed economies, it’s becoming clear the tools states and individuals need to manage the coronavirus pandemic are still in short supply or, worse, not even invented.      One bottleneck to the mass production of critical goods, from antibody (or serology) tests to face masks, necessary to keep the public safe is copyright law. These chokeholds held over the world of atoms and the world of bits are preventing the appropriate response to a global pandemic, said Mark Radcliffe, a partner at DLA Piper, a global law firm.      “It’s not just people in universities but commercial companies that are hesitant to build tools, unless they have the rights that they need,” he said. “They’re constantly looking over their shoulder, afraid of getting sued.”      See also: Open Source PPE: Decentralizing Face Mask Production      That’s why Radcliffe helped author the Open COVID Pledge, an initiative to open source patents held by universities, companies and others to support the development of medicines, test kits, vaccines and, yes, contact tracing tools. “It is a practical and moral imperative that every tool we have at our disposal be applied to develop and deploy technologies on a massive scale without impediment,” the pledge reads.    Those that sign the pledge are asked to give free license to their intellectual property, which otherwise would stymie independent development of potentially lifesaving goods. Today, Amazon, Facebook, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Microsoft and Sandia National Laboratories have announced their participationhttps://opencovidpledge.org/2020/04/20/tech-innovators-join-open-covid-pledge-to-make-patents-freely-available-in-the-fight-against-covid-19/.    Launched earlier this month, Mozilla and Creative Commons had already signed on, with Intel alone freeing up over 72,000 patents for public use, Radcliffe said. With today’s additions, the pledgers hold hundreds of thousands of patents that are now available on a temporary basis.    The idea is to make it broadly available on a royalty free basis so people don't have to worry about being sued.    Open source development enables a swifter response than traditional and proprietary development to supply crises. “It allows people to iterate and make improvements rapidly if you can’t get access to all the parts you need,” Radcliffe said.      In Italy, during the height of the country's pandemic, 3D printers were put to use producing much-needed ventilators. That is, until the project butted up against copyright infringement.      The “ad hoc” group of legal experts and scientists leading the Open COVID project have written a draft licensing agreement, the Open COVID License 1.0, as a template for immediate use, though companies can also create a custom legal arrangement. “The idea is to make it broadly available on a royalty-free basis so people don't have to worry about being sued,” Radcliffe said.      The terms of the license will be effective retroactively from Dec. 1, 2019, and sunset one year after the World Health Organization calls the end of the pandemic. “Once this is over, companies will have to work together to come up with commercially reasonable license terms. And [companies like] Intel will also be able to reassert their intellectual property rights,” he said.      The pledge is not designed to be applied to a particular project or product, but to give “all teams the confidence that they won't get sued,” Radcliffe said.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/04/20/big-tech-signs-rare-open-source-pledge-to-boost-supplies-during-covid-19,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5843379661b5b56eb44b4e86f57ed119bec15d5b-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383552,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9wsST,1587419984,"Market Wrap: Oil Futures Plunge, Bitcoin Dips and Tether Has a $7B Day","Monday marked a historic moment in traditional markets, with the price of West Texas Intermediate oil futures going into negative territory for the first time ever.      Contracts for May delivery, expiring on Tuesday, collapsed below -$40 per barrel at one point. In other words, sellers were willing to pay as much as $40 to people to take a barrel off their hands. Excess supply in the midst of a massive global downturn has led to a storage problem for crude. Some traders are even making $2 offers per barrel on the spot market.      The breathtaking crash in oil prices was taken as a warning sign to U.S. stocks and bonds: a recovery, where demand for energy would put those stockpiled barrels to use, appears to be further in the distance than anticipated. The S&P 500 index slipped 1.7 percent while safe-haven U.S. Treasury bonds saw an influx of dollars that pushed two-year yields down to 5 percent. Bond yields fall as prices rise.      Gold also gained on the day. On Monday, the precious metal climbed 0.86 percent to $1,713.40 per troy ounce.      Oil also took its toll on the FTSE 100 index toward the end of its trading day Monday. Though the British equity index closed up less than a percent, it started off with strong gains but started to tumble in afternoon trading on concerns about the energy sector.      Several hour earlier in Asia, the Nikkei 225 slipped 1.15 percent. The dip arrives as Japan’s Ministry of Finance reported poor trade numbers, with exports declining by more than 11% while imports dropped by 5% in March.    Crypto markets    Bitcoin prices merely shrugged at the turmoil in the oil markets, slipping 4.4 percent over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index as of 21:35 UTC (5:35 p.m. EDT) Monday.      Read more: Negative Oil Prices Could Hurt Bitcoin Miners Who Use Flared Gas      The price for 1 BTC fell below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages at 11:00 UTC (7 a.m. EDT), with trading dropping below $7,000, eventually dipping to around $6,920 levels on exchanges such as Coinbase.      The world’s oldest cryptocurrency was then able to return to the $7,000 level before large amounts of selling volume at 18:00 UTC (2 p.m.PM EDT) pushed prices down to around the $6,830 range.      Most major digital assets are primarily in the red on CoinDesk’s big board for the day.      Ether slipped 5.8 percent. Large losers include dash (DASH) dropping 8.9 percent, bitcoin gold (BTG) down 7 percent and bitcoin sv (BSV) dipping 6 percent. One notable winner today is stellar (XLM), in the green 1.3 percent.    Tether breaks $7 billion    The market capitalization of tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency markets, surpassed $7 billion this past week, well more than double where it was a year ago. As tether is pegged at roughly 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, its market cap is a reflection of how much is believed to be held in assets against each coin.      With an additional 120 million printed on April 18, USDT currently has a circulating supply of 6,992,102,061 USDT. Due to USDT’s slight price premium above the U.S. dollar, the current market cap is around $7 billion, according to data from aggregator Nomics. Tether says it has $7.1 billion in assets as of Monday.      Tether’s price is often more than a dollar because of the convenience it provides some of its owners, according to Vishal Shah, a crypto options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5. “Tether trades at a premium to USD and highlights a capital flight situation in which there is limited access to hard currency,” he told CoinDesk.       Some 74 percent of all bitcoins traded on major exchanges are done against tether, according to data site CryptoCompare.      USDT’s ubiquity on cryptocurrency exchanges offsets concerns traders may have about the stablecoin, Shah noted. “Tether is the most easily accessed USD-proxy stablecoin, and arguably has a more colored background than some of its direct competitors.”      Indeed, that background includes questions about provenance of the assets backing USDT.      Read more: Bearish or Bullish? What Oil, Defi Hacks and Cash Hoarding Tell Us About Markets      Competing stablecoins like USD Coin (USDC) have independently audited financial statements showing custody accounts with dollars backing blockchain-based stable assets, the idea being redemption of one USDC equals one dollar from Centre, the group that issues the stablecoin backed by Coinbase and Circle.      “Customers holding USD Coin and who open accounts with a Centre member issuer are always able to redeem 1 USD Coin for $1 USD,” said Josh Hawkins, vice president for communications at Circle.      “USD Coin holders also gain the assurance that the funds are fully reserved, as the Centre Consortium requires that issuers be regulated financial institutions, and also that reserves backing USD Coin are always held at 100%,” he added.      In comparison, Tether’s terms of service explicitly state that holders of USDT could experience redemption in some other security or asset than dollars should the stablecoin become illiquid.      With the growth of banking-friendly USDC, it’s clear regulatory issues surrounding stablecoins will come to a head, says David Johnston, Managing Director of Yeoman's Capital. Johnston is concerned that solvency could be a problem in the future with Tether, a problem that plagued early bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, the aftermath of which is still an ongoing legal affair.      “USDT is going the way of Mt. Gox, if they don't become either fully decentralized or a regulated extension of the central banks,” Johnston told CoinDesk.      He also mentioned the 2019 draft report on stablecoin risks from a G7 working group as an indication stablecoin regulation could soon be on the way. “USDT has existed in the gray area between centralized and decentralized. With these new recommendations from the Financial Stability Board it's clear that this gray area will soon no longer exist,” Johnston said.

42383543,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9wsH9,1587418398,Negative Oil Prices Could Hurt Bitcoin Miners Who Use Flared Gas,"The few North American bitcoin miners who’ve built their businesses around fossil-fuel extraction are watching the oil markets with more excitement than fear, they say, as oil prices sink to historic lows.      Oil-extraction companies need to reduce gas emissions for environmental reasons. So, instead of flaring off excess gas on site, some bitcoin mining firms – like Upstream Data in Canada, Crusoe Energy in Colorado and DJ Bitwreck in Texas – capture the excess gas to fuel hundreds of bitcoin-mining computers.      The trouble is, if oil market collapse shuts these power sources down then bitcoin miners can’t capture their waste.      When the price of bitcoin drops dramatically, as it did in March, bitcoin mining can quickly become unprofitable. Some mining operations shut down rather than lose money. Only larger, industrial farms can withstand months without profits if the bitcoin price remains low.      Entrepreneurs need to look for cheap power sources – and that’s where oil-abstraction waste products come in.      Texas crude    In Texas, a bitcoin miner who goes by the alias DJ Bitwreck said he’s building new hardware for capturing flare gas. His team, with four co-founders total, will take another five months to build these devices.      “We've utilized roughly 40 kilowatts annually, which has really been our testing and proof-of-concept phase,” said DJ Bitwreck, who’s seeking to add at least 1 megawatt of power from flare gas. “We are looking for sites that would let us come in and put a generator and a shipping-container-size mining hut at the flare site. Most of all, flare gas is a headache and problem for producers, but their problem is our gold mine.”      Great American Mining co-founder Marty Bent, already running one such bitcoin mining operation in North Dakota since December 2019, said if the oil companies stop operating “there isn't any gas byproduct to consume.” On the other hand, though, Bent estimated that on his site alone there are “hundreds” of megawatts of power that could be converted into bitcoin.      Negative oil prices aside, from DJ Bitwreck’s perspective, there’s no point in miners pivoting strategies until after May’s bitcoin halving, which reduces the rewards bitcoin miners can earn.    Wait till June    All of the above-mentioned startups remain moderately profitable and lean, even if the price of bitcoin doesn’t climb in 2020.      Still, it remains to be seen what would happen to all but a few massive bitcoin farms if both oil and bitcoin prices stay low throughout the year.      “We expect the waters to get very choppy but we're actually excited for it,” DJ Bitwreck said. “That's why we aren't buying equipment right now, we're ideally looking to pick equipment up off other ships that capsize in the choppy waters.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/20/negative-oil-prices-could-hurt-bitcoin-miners-who-use-flared-gas,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b705e300b8c3f035162b6e878f214cc972969d4c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The CFTC conducted an onsite technical evaluation of the exchange's operations before granting the approval, according to an order issued Monday.      Bitnomial said it was the ""first and only startup exchange"" to receive approval to offer both margined and physically delivered bitcoin futures and options contracts in the U.S.      ""The approval allows Bitnomial to tackle a confluence of generational shifts in financial markets: First, a new generation of customers are emerging as savvy with trading, technology and delivery. Second, innovative new unregulated derivatives are booming with daily volumes topping $45 [billion] but may be illegal for many U.S. traders,"" it said in a press release.      The release also said Bitnomial hopes to find customers for what it termed ""new growth areas,"" claiming the existing legacy firms have had difficulty tapping this base.      Bitnomial is now setting up user acceptance testing, expected to begin on April 27, and has opened user signups.      In a statement, founder and CEO Luke Hoersten said the company will start with quarterly futures, micro futures and options. Contracts trade on 37 percent margin and will settle on-chain rather than book entry.      Jump Capital's Peter Johnson said physically settled bitcoin futures contracts are ""still largely inaccessible"" to much of the U.S. market. Jump Capital backed Bitnomial, alongside Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent firm.      ""[Bitnomial's] products are also reliably tied to the underlying asset price via the option for physical delivery. We’re excited to be partners with a company that is committed to meeting the highest regulatory standards and increasing the accessibility of crypto derivatives to U.S. traders,"" he said in a statement.

42383541,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9wsFt,1587411461,European Contact Tracing Consortium Faces Wave of Defections Over Centralization Concerns,"European researchers are raising alarms over the direction of contact tracing in the EU amid concerns countries such as France and Germany could choose a centralized system that puts personal privacy at risk.      The group of academics, organizations and companies helping develop the underlying technology for a number of EU nations, known as the European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) consortium, faced a wave of criticism over the weekend from researchers.      Prestigious research universities such as ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) and KU Leuven, among others – which had formed the Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP3T) initiative – pulled out of the consortium over what they called a lack of transparency and commitment to offering a decentralized contact tracing solution.      See also: Decentralized Protocol Removed From EU Contact Tracing Website Without Notice      “We left because we can't be part of an organization that is not transparent on how decisions are made, on their design and on their code,” Carmela Troncoso, a tenure track Assistant Professor at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne and who was helping head negotiations around the DP3T proposal within the consortium, told CoinDesk in a direct message.      Contact tracing is the process by which health authorities track the spread of viruses, identifying who has been in contact with infected individuals and should therefore be quarantined. Countries are executing this process through location tracking of cell phones, facial recognition, digital health passes that restrict movement and Bluetooth proximity tracing.      Google and Apple have announced a plan to update their mobile operating systems to allow Bluetooth tracing. That project has been criticized on privacy grounds for leaving out many people who don’t have the right type of smartphones and for being unworkable in the absence of widespread testing. A lack of testing would hamper any contact tracing methods because it would be difficult to tell who was actually sick, given many COVID-19 carriers are asymptomatic. At that point, it’s less contact tracing and purely tracing.    We're not focusing on decentralization just because on principle we think it would be better to have this privacy preserving app. It's really that we need to be able to convince the general public.    The PEPP-PT was convened to offer privacy-respecting proposals that would align with the newly instituted General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which ensures greater privacy and data protection for EU citizens than is currently enforced in the U.S.      The departures come after the PEPP-PT removed any mention of the decentralized protocol proposal DP3T from its website on Thursday, inciting confusion and frustration amid the DP3T team, who were not told beforehand.      In response to a request for comment, the PEPP-PT said this was bad communication on its part and it deeply regretted any offense.      In an email sent Friday evening to Hans-Christian Boos, one of the heads of PEPP-PT, Kenneth Paterson, who is a professor at the Applied Cryptography Group at the ETH Zurich Computer Science Department and is working on DP3T, asked that he “remove all mention of ETH Zurich and the ETH Zurich logo from the PEPP-PT website and from all other materials associated with PEPP-PT forthwith.”      See also: For Contact Tracing to Work, Americans Will Have to Trust Google and Apple      In the same email Paterson said ETH Zurich's goals seem to be better aligned with the DP3T initiative.      “Today’s sequence of events left my confidence in PEPP-PT badly shaken. PEPP-PT promised a release of documents today. They released a single one, for five minutes. This has gone beyond a joke and descended into farce,” Paterson told CoinDesk in an email Friday evening.      Paterson is referencing a short PDF that was uploaded briefly to PEPP-PT’s GitHub but then removed.      Multiple cryptographers who reviewed the PDF said they couldn’t comment on the privacy or security protections because the document was so vague, with one likening it to the first draft of a college freshman’s essay written shortly before deadline.      The next day, PEPP-PT released a full slate of documents and a more detailed version of its protocol.      “Countries and their app developers should be able to choose an option that best fits their pandemic management needs. All models offered or under discussion by PEPP-PT are privacy enforcing,” said a PEPP-PT public relations official when CoinDesk asked whether an alternative to the decentralized method had been decided upon.    A decentralized approach means a government agency couldn’t abuse that trust even if it wanted to.    The official said the PEPP-PT system has many components and countries will have decentralized and centralized data transfer models for their app developers to choose from.      Critics have long said a centralized approach could be abused, even as multiple countries have said they plan to build apps on the PEPP-PT protocol.      “We now have a lot of governments interacting,” PEPP-PT’s Boos told journalists on a call Friday, according to TechCrunch. “Some governments are publicly declaring that their local applications will be built on top of the principles of PEPP-PT and also the various protocols supplied inside this initiative.""      In Bluetooth contact tracing, devices that come close to each other share pseudonymized IDs. The difference between a centralized and decentralized approach amounts to where that data is stored – on the trusted server of a government or state health organization or locally on a person's device, with a server only relaying the information when needed.      In a centralized scenario, users are expected to trust that any state or security agency would not abuse information stored on a server. To privacy advocates, laws like GDPR are not enough for a sensitive national system. They want privacy by design. A decentralized approach means a government agency couldn’t abuse that trust even if it wanted to because there would be no centralized repository of data.      See also: Europe Debates COVID-19 Contact Tracing That Respects Privacy      “The server generates the pseudonyms at the setup phase, sends them to the client over transport layer security, and permanently stores them on the server in a relational database linked to the user’s info,” said a cryptographer, Nadim Kobeissi, who runs applied cryptography consultancy firm Symbolic Software, after reviewing the PEPP-PT’s protocol documentation.      “How can that possibly ever be privacy preserving? I mean, why even bother building a set of measures around that if that’s how you’re starting off? Why begin with such a mountain of a handicap?”      INRIA, the French national research institute for the digital sciences and a founding member of PEPP-PT, is working on a centralized approach, which it published on GitHub over the weekend. It argues that the centralized vs. decentralized debate is “misleading” and that a “fully decentralized” approach is not realistic for proximity tracing.”      Advocates of a centralized approach say privacy can be protected under such a model, and that data can be better analyzed and lead to better epidemiological models.      But Monday morning, a group of over 300 academics from more than 25 countries published a joint statement recommending decentralized approaches be adopted when it comes to contact tracing applications.      James Larus, Dean of the School of Computer and Communications Science at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne, who helped craft the statement, said it clearly refers to the PEPP-PT proposal and the slight variant issued by INRIA (ROBERT), “both of which are centralized proposals that require a high degree of trust in the centralized server, with the clear potential for 'mission creep' where the system gets repurposed for surveillance.”      Such systems can “catastrophically hamper trust in and acceptance of such an application by society at large” and thereby harm the effectiveness of any COVID-19 app, which is dependent on how many people use it.      “People have to believe they're not going to be losing their privacy,” said Larus. “It's voluntary to use these apps. We're not focusing on decentralization just because on principle we think it would be better to have this privacy-preserving app. It's really that we need to be able to convince the general public.”",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/04/20/european-contact-tracing-consortium-faces-wave-of-defections-over-centralization-concerns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1264baa6bbd54d45825a4bfc6a4d02f0819d17ac-1189x669.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42383550,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9wsPx,1587410846,Dai Lending Rates Rise to One-Month High on DeFi Platform Compound,"Interest rates have spiked for deposits of dai, the U.S. dollar-linked stablecoin, on the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Compound, another ripple effect from the worldwide coronavirus-related market meltdown.      The annual percentage rate a user would earn by lending dai on the platform rose above 14 percent as of 19:00 UTC Monday – the highest level since March 16, according to Codefi Data, a unit of Ethereum startup ConsenSys. Earlier in the day, the rate was in the mid-single digits; for most of April, it had been below 1 percent.      At one point over the weekend, Compound was offering an interest rate of 12.74 percent on dai deposits, according to another data source, DeFi Rate.      Dai, a stablecoin issued by the MakerDAO protocol, is designed to maintain 1:1 parity with the dollar. Its value is backed by ether and other cryptocurrencies that are locked up in a smart contract, the Maker collateral vault. However, dai has been trading above $1 for nearly two months.      “Over the past few days, many Compound users have begun withdrawing dai, and in some cases selling it above $1 in anticipation of dai returning to its peg,” said Compound CEO Robert Leshner.      Read more: Why This Global Crisis Is a Defining Moment for Stablecoins      The rate hike is the result of those withdrawals and the resulting shortage of funds to lend.      Data from Ethereum blockchain explorer Etherescan shows a total of 6.9 million dai were withdrawn from the Compound protocol on Saturday and Sunday.       “The substantial outflows pushed gross borrowing above gross deposits on dai’s lending pool for a moment over the weekend,” DeFi Rate told CoinDesk.      At press time, the utilization ratio, or gross borrowing to gross deposits, was at 94 percent, according to Compound data.    Out of whack    “Dai markets have been under considerable stress the past few weeks, with the price of dai consistently being above $1,” Leshner told CoinDesk. As noted, it is a stablecoin and is supposed to trade around $1.       Dai began trading above $1 at the end of February and rose as high as $1.25 on Bitfinex on March 12.      The unprecedented rise was caused by the global dash for cash, mainly U.S. dollars, triggered by the relentless coronavirus-led sell-off in the traditional markets.      ""One source of funds was the ethereum collateral that debtors had locked up to get loans. To get at this ethereum, debtors had to repurchase dai in order to pay back their obligations. Their desperation to repurchase dai stablecoins was such that the price spiked to $1.50, "" noted CoinDesk’s columnist J.P. Koning.      Bitcoin fell by nearly 40 percent on March 12 and hit a low of $3,867 on the following day, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Bitcoin and stocks have recovered significantly over the past couple of weeks. However, dai is still trading above $1.00 - a sign the desire to liquidate dai is still strong.      Read more: Circle CEO Claims ‘Explosive’ Stablecoin Demand From Everyday Businesses      Observers, however, are worried about the lack of exchange rate stability. ""It is an existential threat to MakerDAO’s long-term success. An emergency action is required,"" ParaFi Capital said in a post on MakerDAO forum.      The alternative investment firm focused on blockchain and decentralized finance markets has recommended the addition of link, the token of the Chainlink network, as new collateral in      MakerDAO. “Given its market cap, liquidity profile and appetite for speculation, we see value in onboarding LINK into MCD,” noted ParaFi Capital.      “Meanwhile, MakerDAO is responding with proposals to increase the number of assets that back dai, which will allow more dai to be minted, lowering its price,” said Compound’s Leshner.

42383551,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9wsTj,1587405882,"Blockchain Bites: ConsenSys Cuts, dForce Doomsday and Bitcoin ATMs Boom","A weekend hack drained funds from a popular decentralized finance application, Ethereum incubator ConsenSys is laying off about 90 employees and bitcoin ATMs are seeing growth during the coronavirus contagion event.      In a breaking story, ConsenSys has confirmed to CoinDesk that due to coronavirus-led market turmoil, the firm will cut approximately 14 percent of its headcount. The move follows a round of layoffs announced in February, and leaves the firm with just over 550 employees. ""All key operational aspects of the business are preserved to ensure the development and service of key products and solutions,"" the company said in its statement. Here's the story:      You're reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they're significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk's newsletters here.    Top Shelf    DeFi Disaster Decentralized finance protocol dForce is insolvent following a late-night weekend exploit. While the perpetrator is unknown, the hack exploited a known vulnerability of the ERC-777 standard. Due to the way dForce lending program Lendf.Me’s smart contract is set up, the hacker was able to continually withdraw funds without the program’s balance updating, eventually scoring 99 percent of the assets – more than $25 million – locked within. The Multicoin Capital-backed dForce had been accused of cribbing code from competing application Compound.      The hackers allegedly returned $126,014 back to Lendf.Me with a note saying, ""Better luck next time,"" according to Chain News.      ConsenSys Cuts Ethereum incubator ConsenSys is laying off ""just over 90"" staffers, or about 14 percent of the firm's headcount. ""The global COVID-19 pandemic has deeply impacted the world's health and livelihood,"" a company spokesperson told CoinDesk. ""ConsenSys has carefully analyzed its business in relation to what is occurring globally. Like most of its peers, the company is seeing extraordinary uncertainty in the market, with businesses rebalancing priorities and reevaluating timelines.""      Bitcoin Futures Renaissance Technologies $10 billion Medallion fund is considering jumping into bitcoin futures, recent regulatory filings show. The firm has “permitted” the Medallion fund to enter the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s (CME) cash-settled bitcoin futures market, a financial instrument widely considered to be a proxy for institutional interest in bitcoin.      Hong Kong's securities regulator has approved the jurisdiction's first-ever bitcoin index fund designed for institutional investors. Arrano Capital, the blockchain investment arm of asset management firm Venture Smart Asia, hopes to surpass $100 million in total assets under management through a fund tracking bitcoin prices.      Movers & Shakers Coinbase has hired former Barclays markets veteran, Brett Tejpaul, to head up institutional coverage at the San Francisco-based crypto exchange. Tejpaul spent 17 years at Barclays in various leadership roles including global head of sales, global head of credit and commodities, and Barclays’ first “head of digital” role, which included managing fintech venture investments. Calibra, a Facebook subsidiary helping to develop the blockchain-based Libra currency, is looking to hire 50 people in Ireland. (The Irish Times)      20K, 2 Days Topaz, the Ethereum 2.0 testnet, has garnered nearly 20,000 validators two days after its April 18 debut. “One of the key goals for Topaz is to test the Phase 0 proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol implementation on Ethereum 2.0, to which the network will eventually transfer from the current computationally-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism,” Decrypt’s Liam Frost reports.      Cash Doings Crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Binance.US are reporting a spike in the number of buys and deposits of $1,200, the amount gifted to some U.S. citizens as part of a Federal government’s financial stimulus during the coronavirus-led downturn. ""People do seem to have deposited exactly $1,200 into Binance.US in the past couple of days,"" a Binance.US representative said, adding that the transactions coincided with the date the checks were cut.      Meanwhile, Russians are stocking up on cash. One trillion rubles ($13.6 billion) were issued from ATMs and banks through March – more than for all of 2019, according to a report by BNN Bloomberg.      Airdrop Regulation From Up High Singapore’s tax authority will not take a cut of airdropped cryptocurrency so long as the recipient gets it for free, according to an income tax treatment guide published Friday.      Bitcoin ATMs Some bitcoin ATM operators are reporting an increase in transactions while others are taking advantage of shelter-in-place rulings to expand their networks. The number of bitcoin ATMs in the United States increased 5.6 percent from March to April, as companies like LibertyX and DigitalMint expanded into new markets. And as interest in Bitcoin soars during COVID-19, other crypto ATMs are experiencing their highest ever amount of transaction volumes.      Asian Expansion Institutional custody startup Curv has expanded into Asia with an office in Hong Kong and a partnership with Japan-based Crypto Garage, the companies announced Friday. The startup will help Asian exchanges self-custody various cryptocurrencies with its multi-party computation (MPC) technology. CEO Itay Malinger said Asia has more exchanges per capita than other parts of the world, and are more likely to self-custody.      Olympic Use Case The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said that its digital currency could be used in the 2022 Winter Olympics event. (The Block)      Opinion: Dai Should Consider Negative Interest Rates On March 12, U.S. equity prices plunged 10 percent, bitcoin and ethereum prices plummeted almost 50 percent, and dai – a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar – skyrocketed as high as $1.50. “This shouldn't have happened,” CoinDesk columnist J.P. Koning writes in his latest op-ed, which raises the question if MakerDAO should have negative interest rates for dai. “It's role is to mimic the performance of an underlying national currency, in this case the U.S. dollar. But at $1.50, dai was suddenly worth one-and-a-half U.S. dollars. It didn't look very stable at all.”    CoinDesk Live    CoinDesk Live: Lockdown Edition continues its popular twice-weekly chats with Consensus speakers via Zoom and Twitter.

Market Intel    Easing Volatility Bitcoin market volatility has hit three-month lows, marking a price squeeze that could soon pave the way for a big move on either side. The spread between bitcoin’s Bollinger bands – volatility indicators that often indicate an impending price swing – narrowed to $895 on Monday, the lowest level since Jan. 6. “When it tightens, it is because we have been consistently trading in a narrower range for a prolonged period and we should see a breakout very soon,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote.      Testing, Testing Bitcoin appears on track to test the psychological hurdle of $8,000, having found acceptance above a key hurdle last week. The cryptocurrency closed last week above the horizontal 100-week average resistance, which has consistently capped upside the preceding four weeks, part of an ongoing rally from the March low of $3,856.

42383542,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9wsIP,1587402231,Heifer International Joins Libra Association to 'Support Financial Inclusion',"Global nonprofit Heifer International is joining the Libra Association, it announced Monday, becoming the 23rd official member of the organization.      The group joined Libra to facilitate the creation of a low-cost, accessible financial system, it said in a blog post, noting that Libra's stated mission is to build a system that ""will support financial inclusion, competition, and responsible financial services innovation.""      Charity Navigator gives Heifer three out of four stars, with a score of 97/100 for accountability and transparency.      ""At Heifer International, we work with some of the world’s poorest farmers, helping them to sustainably increase production and access new markets — increasing their sales and incomes. As farmers grow their businesses, one of the major challenges they face is access to credit,"" it said in the blog post.      Heifer CEO and President Pierre Ferrari said in a tweet that ""Farmers who use local money lenders face high interest rates & loans that can be impossible to pay off, preventing them from building sustainable livelihoods.""      In a tweet, Libra Association's head of policy and communications, Dante Disparte, said he was pleased to welcome the group, adding that it ""has worked to end hunger and poverty"" for more than 75 years.      The news came just days after the association revamped its original vision of the stablecoin project, making major concessions to regulators concerned about the impact of libra on global stability and monetary sovereignty. Specifically, libra is now going to be a series of stablecoins, each backed by a single currency and cash equivalents.      The group is looking at issuing stablecoins backed by the dollar, the euro, the British pound and the Singapore dollar, as some examples.      Libra still plans to issue a stablecoin backed by a basket of currencies, as it originally envisioned, but this will now be backed by the new stablecoins it issues.      Still, it's unclear whether libra's revamp will convince lawmakers. At least one, Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas) has already said its changes are ""insufficient"" in her eyes. Garcia has previously introduced the ""Managed Stablecoins are Securities Act,"" which would classify libra as a security if it is passed and signed into law.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/20/heifer-international-joins-libra-association-to-support-financial-inclusion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e50a504cfddcb94853226870e136eb54d0b4989-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Brooklyn, N.Y.-based firm known for incubating Ethereum projects is cutting ""just over 90"" people, a spokesperson confirmed. That's about 14 percent of the firm's headcount.      ""The global COVID-19 pandemic has deeply impacted the world's health and livelihood,"" the company spokesperson told CoinDesk. ""ConsenSys has carefully analyzed its business in relation to what is occurring globally. Like most of its peers, the company is seeing extraordinary uncertainty in the market, with businesses rebalancing priorities and reevaluating timelines.""      The move, word of which leaked out after a company town hall meeting Monday, follows a round of layoffs announced in February. Those cuts also shrunk the firm's headcount by approximately 14 percent, the company said at the time. The numbers indicate that ConsenSys may have begun the year with just under 850 employees, and now retains just over 550.      ""All key operational aspects of the business are preserved to ensure the development and service of key products and solutions,"" the company said in its statement.      The firm also mentioned current work on ""crisis-related opportunities such as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), emergency loans disbursement solutions, supply chains for personal protective equipment (PPE), and related identity solutions.""      ConsenSys says affected employees will be provided two months of severance pay and career transition services.      Led by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, ConsenSys laid off about 13 percent of its workforce in a late-2018 restructuring dubbed ""ConsenSys 2.0.""

The social media giant is looking to hire 50 people for its payments subsidiary Calibra – charged with creating a wallet for storing and sending libra – to start work at its offices in Dublin by the end of 2020. The news was first reported by the Irish Times on Monday.      A Calibra spokesperson told CoinDesk many of the new Dublin openings are for a new compliance team to liaise with regulators, as well as for specialists who can work on the wallet's fraud protection program. There will also be a new customer service team to handle complaints – a sign the project is readying its launch.      ""We’re actively hiring experts in fraud, compliance, workforce management and customer care to expand our operations team supporting the Calibra Wallet,"" said Laura Morgan Walsh, Calibra's head of operations.

Since 2009, the number of staff employed by Facebook and its partner companies in Ireland has ballooned from 30 to more than 5,000 people. The Calibra openings form part of a new recruitment drive that could take its Irish presence up to 7,000 people by the end of 2020.

42404516,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiZ0X,1587391200,Blockchain Now Officially Part of China's Technology Strategy,"An influential government authority responsible for planning China's economy has said blockchain will form an integral part of the country's data and technology infrastructure.      The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) told reporters Monday blockchain will join other emerging technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT) in underpinning the systems China uses to manage the flow of information in the coming years.      Originally the State Planning Commission, the NDRC is a cabinet-level department that draws up policies and strategies for the direction of the Chinese economy. It has a wide brief that covers everything from investments into public transport to running anti-monopoly probes as well as overseeing corporate debt issuance.      On how new technologies, including blockchain, would be integrated, high-tech director Wu Hao said the NDRC would ""work with relevant departments to study and issue relevant guidance to promote the development of new infrastructure [and] revise and improve the access rules that are conducive to the sustainable and healthy development of emerging industries.""      See also: Huawei, Tencent, JD.com Among Big Names on China’s New Blockchain Committee      What that means for blockchain's future in China is hard to know, because the NDRC has a complicated relationship with the broader industry.      An NDRC subsidiary has been working on a new Blockchain Service Network (BSN) that would provide companies with access to the tools they need to develop blockchain-based applications. Having already launched for domestic commercial use, it will open for global companies later this week.      However, last April the NDRC included the country's substantial bitcoin mining sector on a draft proposal for the industries it wanted ""eliminated"" from China. The body quietly removed mining from its list of undesirable industries weeks after Xi made his thoughts on the great potential of blockchain abundantly clear in October.      In the past, the NDRC has issued guidance and supportive policies for industries considered vital for the government's economic strategy. It signed an agreement with the China Development Bank in late 2018, to provide 100 billion yuan ($14.1 billion) in financial support to companies working in emerging tech, such as AI and IoT.      See also: Tesla Completes Blockchain Pilot to Speed China Imports Process      Whether the NDRC is planning on providing a similar level of support to companies working with blockchain is not yet known.

Mass adoption has long been one of the main bullish investment theses for bitcoin. The bet is growing numbers of institutions and individuals will eventually come to understand the cryptocurrency's virtues, from its potential use as a peer-to-peer payment system to its potential as a hedge against inflation, like a digital version of gold. As the newbies pile in, prices will soar, the theory goes.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Brian Armstrong, CEO of the major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, tweeted last week the frequency of deposits in the amount of $1,200 had jumped – a hint some recipients of coronavirus relief checks from the U.S. government might even be using the funds to buy cryptocurrencies.      The following chart from CoinDesk Research (using data from Coin Metrics) also shows a surge in addresses holding less than a billionth of the total supply of bitcoin, or those holding roughly $130 or less at current price levels.      Any increase in bitcoin's popularity among retail investors might dovetail with signals that institutional investors are getting into the market, too. Renaissance Technologies, one of the world's biggest hedge funds with $166 billion under management, said in a regulatory filing that its market-beating Medallion fund can now trade bitcoin futures on CME Group's Chicago Mercantile Exchange.      And last week, cryptocurrency-focused investment firm Grayscale said it raised $503.7 million in the first quarter, nearly double the previous quarterly high. The firm, which is controlled by Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company, said in a public report that ""despite the risk asset drawdown this quarter,"" investors are ""increasing their digital-asset exposure.""      Mike Alfred, CEO of cryptocurrency analytics firm Digital Assets Data, told CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole last week that the unprecedented money injections by the Federal Reserve and other central banks have ""pushed many people toward bitcoin as an alternative monetary system.""      ""We are hearing and seeing increased retail interest,"" he said.      Zac Prince, founder and CEO of the cryptocurrency lender BlockFi, noted in a tweet last week the industry is ""still early in our adoption cycle within just our first addressable market of crypto investors, estimated to be low single digit millions just in the U.S.""      In an April 16 report, Arcane Research, a Norwegian cryptocurrency analysis firm, wrote that the number of addresses holding more than 0.01 bitcoin (about $72 at current prices) has climbed by about 5 percent just since March 1, to a new record of 8.3 million.      Arcane, which cited the data provider Glassnode, wrote that the trend might be due to big bitcoin investors – known as ""whales"" in crypto-speak – using so-called mixing services to move their digital assets, essentially splitting their holdings into multiple, smaller accounts.      But it might also be a ""sign of increased user adoption of bitcoin,"" the researchers wrote.      Ki Young Ju, CEO of the Korean cryptocurrency-analytics firm CryptoQuant, noted in a Telegram message the number of unspent transaction outputs recorded on the bitcoin blockchain, known as UTXOs, has also increased.      That could represent a ""small-scale wallets including personal wallets (mass adoption) and mixing activities,"" he wrote.      What's interesting is that Alternative.me's closely tracked ""Fear & Greed Index"" has been pointing to ""extreme fear"" since March 9, a five-week period that's now the longest since the gauge launched in February 2018, according to Arcane.      So if that's the backdrop for greater mass adoption of cryptocurrencies, bitcoiners are eager to see how cryptocurrency markets react when the gauge turns toward greed – or even extreme greed.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    Trend: Bitcoin appears on track to test the psychological hurdle of $8,000, having found acceptance above key hurdle last week.      ""$8,000 test is getting more likely now,"" tweeted popular trader @CryptoCapo_. The bullish view could be attributed with a recent breakout on the weekly chart.      The cryptocurrency closed last week (UTC) above the horizontal 100-week average resistance, which had consistently capped upside in the preceding four weeks. The breakout, coupled with a bullish higher-lows and higher-highs setup on the daily chart, suggest scope for an extension of the ongoing rally from the March low of $3,856.      Exchange activity, too, supports further gains in the short term. For instance, the seven-day moving average of bitcoin balances on cryptocurrency exchanges has declined 2,398,881 on Sunday, according to Glassnode data, likely signaling a shift to holding strategies. Investors usually withdraw coins from the exchanges to hold in their personal wallets when prices are expected to rise.      While the path of least resistance appears to be on the higher side, the possibility of a sudden move lower cannot be ruled out. Some observers believe selling pressure from miners is currently high and could increase further in the coming months as the top cryptocurrency is set to undergo its mining reward halving, a 50 percent reduction in block rewards, next month.      ""We expect the miners to follow a cycle of decreased profit margins, increased selling, capitulation and a culling of the least efficient miners from the network,"" crypto asset analytics company Coin Metrics, stated in its recent “State of the Network” report.      Further, the weekly Money Flow index, which incorporates both price and volume, is signaling a bearish mood in the market. ""Either way, I'll be shorting the rally to $8,000,"" said trader @CryptoCapo_.      First Mover is CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter.

42404518,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiZ2V,1587387600,Why MakerDAO Should Consider Negative Interest Rates for Dai,"J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.      Does the dai stablecoin need negative interest rates?      The coronavirus smashed into markets on March 12. U.S. equity prices plunged by 10 percent, their worst decline since the 1987 stock market crash. Bitcoin and ethereum prices plummeted almost 50 percent.      Meanwhile, the price of dai skyrocketed as high as $1.50. This shouldn't have happened. Dai is a stablecoin. Its role is to mimic the performance of an underlying national currency, in this case the U.S. dollar. Since it came into existence three years ago, dai has mostly hewed to its stated target of $1 U.S. dollar. But at $1.50, dai was suddenly worth one-and-a-half U.S. dollars. It didn't look very stable at all.      See also: MakerDAO Users Sue Stablecoin Issuer Following ‘Black Thursday’ Losses      Dai has since retreated to a range of $1.01 – $1.03. Nevertheless, it has now spent a full month above its $1 peg – and shows no signs of returning.      The Maker protocol, the set of smart contracts that undergirds dai, has a number of tools at its disposal to help push the price of dai back to $1, its target price. One that hasn't been tried? Negative interest rates. Negative interest rates are a controversial subject, both in the cryptocurrency space and in regular fiat land. But they'd probably do the trick.      Is decentralized finance ready for them?      Before we get to the topic of negative rates, let’s run through a quick dai 101.    The corner bank    Think for a moment how a bank works. Say you want to borrow $10,000 to invest in your small business. Your bank, First Corner Bank, needs some security before it will lend you that amount. So you put your $100,000 house up as collateral. It lends you $10,000 in fresh new dollars, which you spend on supplies.      Dai operates along the same principles. If you want a dai loan, you need to submit collateral to the dai system, say $100,000 worth of ethereum. The dai protocol lends you a fraction of this back, say $10,000 worth of dai. These new dai stablecoins can now be spent into the crypto economy.      There are several forces that stabilize the money that has been created by dai and First Corner. You’ll eventually have to pay back your loan. This means you'll have to repurchase either First Corner deposits or dai stablecoins to cancel your debt. This ever-present demand (along with the demand of everyone else who owes money to these institutions) helps to anchor the value of dai and First Corner's deposits near $1.    No one likes to suddenly have to pay fees after years of earning income. But stability isn't a free good. It has to be manufactured.    If you run into difficult times, there's a good chance you won't repay your $10,000 loan. This spells trouble for both issuers. A portion of First Corner's deposits (or dai's stablecoins) no longer has a corresponding repurchaser.      But First Corner and dai have protection. They can seize your house or your ethereum and sell it in order in order to plug the $10,000 void.      And so both types of dollars are well secured and stable. This stability is prized. People like to use dollars as a safe way to save, or keep them on hand as a guaranteed medium for making future purchases. Non-stable assets can’t provide these services.    Why did dai rise to $1.50?    With all that in mind, let's explore what went wrong with dai's price after March 12. As the pandemic advanced, people grew desperate to get their hands on the most liquid and safe assets around, U.S. dollars. This meant selling stocks, ethereum, bitcoin and pretty much anything else.      See also: MakerDAO’s Problems Are a Textbook Case of Governance Failure      One source of funds was the ethereum collateral that debtors had locked up to get loans. To get at this ethereum, debtors had to repurchase dai in order to pay back their obligations. Their desperation to repurchase dai stablecoins was such that the price spiked to $1.50.      Thirty days later, dai continues to trade in excess of the peg, which would seem to suggest an ongoing imbalance in the dai system. There is a heightened desire for dai debtors to liquidate, pushing dai prices up. But not enough people are willing to incur new debts to the system, which would create new dai stablecoins and push prices down.    So what tools does it have?    Maker has used a few tools to help fix imbalances like this.      One is to allow more types of collateral to be pledged to the dai system. This increases the pool of potential debtors. And so more dai will be created, thereby pushing the dai price down.      Another tool is to reduce interest rates. The stability fee is the interest rate that debtors pay to the dai system. If the stability fee is cut, this eases the burden of being a debtor. Existing debtors will feel less desperation to liquidate. Emboldened, new players may step up to the plate and take on loans. New dai is created which helps push the price down to $1.      There is also the dai Savings Rate. Anyone who owns dai stablecoins and locks them away can earn this rate. By reducing the savings rate, the system encourages dai owners to stop hoarding coins. They sell and push the dai price down.      Maker has used all of these tools over the last thirty days. The stability fee quickly fell from by 8 percent to 4 percent and then 0.5 percent. The dai Savings Rate fell to 0 percent. And Maker added USD Coin, another popular stablecoin, to the range of collateral accepted.      But none of this has been enough to restore the peg.    So what about negative rates?    In theory, the next step would be to reduce interest rates into negative territory.      We're all used to the idea that debtors have to pay interest. With negative interest rates, the opposite occurs. Anyone who becomes a debtor receives interest. The “carrot” of a negative stability fee would encourage more people to become indebted to the dai system. This would increase the supply of dai, and in doing so reduce upwards pressure on the peg.      See also: J.P. Koning - Zero Interest Rates Could Hamper the Stablecoin Business      A negative dai savings rate would mean anyone who saved dai stablecoins would no longer receive interest. They would pay a fee. This, too, would increase the supply of dai.      There are two barriers to negative interest rates.      The first is technological. Maker's code doesn't allow the stability fee or dai savings rate to fall into negative territory. A similar problem occurred in fiat land in 2015 when banks found their software would not permit bonds to trade at negative interest rates. They quickly changed the code and it ceased to be a problem.      Maker has always had an indirect way of imposing negative rates: the Target Rate Feedback Mechanism. This involves having the target price for dai fall to 99 or 98 cents to mimic a negative interest rate. But this arcane mechanism is dormant right now (it no longer appears in the Maker white paper). And compared to nudging the stability fee into negative territory, this trick is complicated and intrusive: it wrecks the simplicity of 1 dai equals 1 U.S. dollar.      The second barrier to negative rates is more visceral. Many people who own stable assets view interest as a just reward to saving. For them, a negative interest rate is little more than confiscation. Only an evil central banker could foist such an unnatural state of affairs on the world.      See also: Anthony Xie - For DeFi’s Sake, Maker Should Take Blame for Black Thursday Losses      I understand why negative interest rates upset many people. No one likes to suddenly have to pay fees after years of earning income.      But stability isn't a free good. It has to be manufactured. When the cost of manufacturing stability spikes, it's only fair the buyer of stability, a stablecoin owner, should pay a higher price than before. And those who manufacture stability, dai debtors, should get fairly compensated for their efforts. A negative interest rate is the price that pulls this difficult balancing act off.      It could be negative interest rates are not necessary to cope with the current crisis. The natural passage of time may restore dai to its $1 reference price.      But what about the next crisis? It hardly seems ideal for a stablecoin to rise to a large and drawn-out premium every time a calamity occurs. Isn’t it time to figure out a way to code the ability to set negative interest rates, both the stability fee and savings rate, directly into the dai protocol?",NEUTRAL,없음,ETH | FIAT | MARKET | MKR | TRADING,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/20/why-makerdao-should-consider-negative-interest-rates-for-dai,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a6c438d3e99926151660d496cbed21f77eade861-1500x893.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404523,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiZ6R,1587384196,Bitcoin Volatility at 3-Month Low as Market Awaits Big Price Move,"Bitcoin market volatility has hit three-month lows – marking a price squeeze that could soon pave the way for a big move on either side.      The spread between bitcoin’s Bollinger bands – volatility indicators placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-day moving price average – narrowed to $895 on Monday. That's the lowest level since Jan. 6, when the spread was $636, according to Bitstamp data.      Bitcoin has spent a better part of the last two weeks trading the range of $6,450–$7,450, with the range further narrowing to $7,000–$7,300 since Thursday.      The tightening of Bollinger Bands is widely considered to be an advanced indicator of an impending big move.      “When it tightens, it is because we have been consistently trading in a narrower range for a prolonged period and we should see a breakout very soon,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote.      As can be seen, bitcoin’s price volatility has exploded following previous tight ranges in October 2019 and January 2020.      Other volatility indicators have also witnessed a sharp drop over the last few weeks. For example, the Bollinger bandwidth, which is calculated by dividing the gap between the bands by the 20-day moving average, is seen at 0.13 at press time, having risen from 0.11 to 0.90 (high volatility) in the first three weeks of March.      Historically, a reading below 0.10 has marked an end of price consolidation or low-volatility environment. So with the metric currently at 0.13, we might see bitcoin trade without clear directional bias for a few more days.      Meanwhile, the volatility situation in the bitcoin options market looks to have normalized, as one-month implied volatility is now hovering below its average level of 77 percent, according to data provided by crypto derivatives firm Skew.      Option traders typically buy options when volatility drops below the lifetime average and tend to sell when volatility reaches extreme highs.      One-month implied volatility – the option market’s view of how volatile the asset would be over a four-week period – spiked from 55 percent to 184 percent in the first half of March. That came as the coronavirus-led sell-off in the global equity markets translated into a liquidity crisis that saw investors sell everything from gold to bitcoin.      The cryptocurrency fell by nearly 40 percent on March 12 and hit a low of $3,867 on the following day, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      Meanwhile, the S&P 500, Wall Street’s benchmark index, crashed by 35 percent in the four weeks to March 24, pushing the volatility (VIX) index higher from 20 percent to 86 percent. As of Friday, the S&P was reporting over 25 percent gains from lows seen on March 24, while the VIX index was hovering around 41.    Bearish move ahead?    Uncertainty in both the stock and cryptocurrency markets has declined over the past couple of weeks, largely due to the Federal Reserve’s open-ended asset purchase program and the U.S. government’s massive fiscal stimulus worth trillions of dollars.      However, markets are not out of the woods yet because the number of coronavirus cases is still rising globally. The coronavirus death toll in the U.S. crossed 40,000 over the weekend with over 744,000 infections, raising doubts over the nation's readiness to reopen its economy.      Further, oil prices crashed close to a two-decade low below $16 early Monday on concerns of high inventory buildup in the U.S. As a result, equity markets could come under pressure, pushing bitcoin lower.      Put simply, the low-volatility period could end with a downside move, more so as miner-led selling pressure for bitcoin is currently high, according to crypto asset analytics company Coin Metrics.      On the downside, major support is seen around $6,450, the lower end of the recent trading range.      Some observers may argue the cryptocurrency is set to undergo reward halving next month and the supply-cutting event could draw bids for the cryptocurrencies, yielding a big move on the higher side.      However, both bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV recently failed to rally on their respective halvings. Litecoin, too, crashed following its halving on Aug 5, 2019. As a result, bitcoin investors may not buy into the bullish halving narrative.      At press time, bitcoin is sidelined near $7,070 and the futures on the S&P 500 are reporting risk aversion with a 1.5 percent drop.      While a breakout above the 100-week average confirmed last week is painting a bullish picture, a sudden move lower cannot be ruled out, with the macro factors looking bearish, as noted above. Further, the weekly chart money flow index shows that selling pressure is currently stronger than buying pressure.      The bullish case would get a boost if prices rise above the recent high of $7,469, opening the doors to the 100-day average at $8,075.

One trillion rubles ($13.6 billion) were issued from ATMs and banks through March – more than for all of 2019, according to a report by BNN Bloomberg.      “People were afraid that banks will be unavailable during the quarantine,” Denis Poryvay, an analyst at Raiffeisenbank in Moscow, told the news source. “They withdrew money for the same reason as people hoarded food.”      The large uptick in daily withdrawals closely matched the timing of President Vladimir Putin's regular televised briefings that detailed the measures being taken to tackle the global pandemic from within the country.      A large surge in withdrawals was seen after Putin announced a tax on bank deposits of over one million rubles, with further cash hoarding apparent after the president extended self-isolation measures.      In the United States, too, cash withdrawals have seen a major spike amid the crisis.

42404522,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiZ5S,1587375730,Some US Citizens Look to Be Splashing Their Stimulus Cash on Cryptocurrency,"Nothing screams confidence in the U.S. economy more than swapping Federal Reserve-issued money for a digital hedge against the mainstream financial system.      The U.S. government issued more than 80 million stimulus checks, each for $1,200, last week. To be deposited directly into bank accounts, the payment is intended to give citizens affected by the coronavirus a few extra dollars to pay for essentials, things such as food and utility bills.      But it appears some proportion of Americans instead of spending their stimulus check at Walmart, Amazon or wherever, may have decided to swap their dollars for crypto.      Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted earlier on Friday his exchange had experienced a sudden spike in the number of buys and deposits worth $1,200. Up until mid-April, around 0.1 percent of total buys and deposits had been for $1,200, then it suddenly spiked nearly 0.4 percent this week, around the time many Americans started receiving their stimulus checks.      Of course, it's impossible to say for certain if all these deposits were U.S. citizens looking for a new home for their government-issued money. The graph doesn't specify what the split was between buys and deposits, so it's possible some customers may have simply parked their money in the exchange. We can't tell if these deposits even came from the U.S.      See also: Coinbase Moves to Cut Blockchain Load With Bitcoin Batching      But despite a soaring unemployment rate, most in the U.S. are still working and still getting paid. Many who are financially secure may have decided to invest, rather than spend, their stimulus checks.      Investors aren't just heading over to Coinbase with their stimulus money. Speaking to CoinDesk, a Binance US spokesperson confirmed they had also seen a spike in $1,200 deposits. ""People do seem to have deposited exactly $1,200 into Binance US in the past couple of days,"" the firm said.      Adding to the evidence, last Thursday was also the single largest day for USD deposits into Binance US for more than a month, the spokesperson added, but declined to go into the specifics of how many deposits that would be.

Arrano Capital, the blockchain investment arm of asset management firm Venture Smart Asia, has now met the licensing requirements from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) allowing it to begin dealing in cryptocurrency, according to a report by Bloomberg on Sunday. Within the first 12 months, Arrano is hoping to surpass $100 million in total assets under management through a fund tracking bitcoin prices.      The fund marks the first of its kind to have passed regulatory approval on the basis that it solely targets institutional investors. To market to the general public, the fund would have to become an ""authorized fund"" under Hong Kong rules. Arrano getting the green light potentially paves the way for similar funds to begin filing for licenses in the blockchain-friendly region.      Avaneesh Acquilla, chief investment officer at Arrano Capital, said that while the firm had received approvals for a bitcoin fund, he expected opportunities for other products in the future.

This type of fund offers a portfolio developed to match or track the components of a financial market index such as the S&P 500.

42404512,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiYwb,1587355200,Singapore Won't Tax Airdrops or Hard Forks Under New Crypto Guidance,"Singapore’s tax authority will not take a cut of airdropped cryptocurrency so long as the recipient gets it for free, according to an income tax treatment guide published Friday.      The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore's (IRAS) e-tax guide fills in the tax gaps for so-called “digital tokens,” a catch-all for three crypto types: payment tokens, used to by goods and services; utility tokens, which represent a right to goods and services; and security tokens, or digital securities. Each has a new definition and corresponding tax treatment from the IRAS.      Meant as a guide for consumers and businesses as well as issuers of initial coin offerings (ICO), the guide describes a fragmented approach for an industry still coming into form.      The tax guide also clarifies procedures for more obscure crypto events. For example, IRAS will not levy income taxes against airdropped payment tokens or those that come from a blockchain hard fork, which is a “windfall.” Like other payment tokens, nontraditionally delivered cryptos will nonetheless be taxable on transactions.      IRAS’ guide considers payment tokens such as bitcoin to be “intangible property” instead of legal tender. If a consumer pays in bitcoin he is engaging in “barter trade” for which the goods and services are taxed, not the payment token itself. The same goes for businesses that can value their goods’ tax burden against government-issued money metrics.      Where things get tricky is determining the tax burden of a good or service with a value natively represented in crypto. A contractor who agrees to do a job for three bitcoins, for example, has no surefire way to calculate his tax because the IRAS has no “methodology to value payment tokens.”      The IRAS therefore mandates that taxpayers self-determine a “reasonable and verifiable” exchange rate from widely available services such as Coinbase and Binance.      Utility token transactions, conversely, are “unlikely” to trigger a taxable event for the user, whose acquisition of them as a right to future services “will be treated as prepayment.” In fact, utility tokens’ use will actually be deductible under the guide.      Security tokens operate under the same loose tax laws Asia’s tax haven applies to other securities. Singapore levies no capital gains tax on securities of any kind and sparingly taxes dividends depending on the issuer, leaving security tokens taxable only when classified as a “revenue asset.”      Singapore's investor-friendly tax scheme leaves security token ICO issuers with the entirety of their raised capital. Utility token ICO issuers are not so lucky. Their proceeds are effectively deferred revenue that is taxable as soon as they deliver the goods. Payment token ICO issuers need to pay right away, though the guide said such schemes are “uncommon.”      “An examination of the case facts may be required” for payment token ICOs, according to the guide.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE | FORKS,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/20/singapore-wont-tax-airdrops-or-hard-forks-under-new-crypto-guidance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/57d8faa45564ec563fb0b7ca46cdfc5e43d00eb3-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404526,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiZ9O,1587344889,Crypto Long & Short: The Battle of the Yields,"“Cash is trash” has a nice rhyme to it, and in some inflation-ravaged, paper-based economies it's literally true. But as an investment mantra it bears some scrutiny, especially in light of what it says about bitcoin.      When a multi-asset manager such as Ray Dalio uses that phrase, as he did in Davos earlier this year, we can assume he means cash is not as attractive for portfolios as other assets. He expanded further on this in a question-and-answer session on Reddit earlier this month, pointing out its “costly negative return.”      You're reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk's head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor's point of view. You can subscribe here.      This warrants further clarification, as the actual yield on cash is a complex subject. The cash under your mattress does not earn any interest and has a theoretical storage cost. (Even if there’s no direct outlay, there’s the cost of a lack of solid rest due to bumpy sleep surfaces.) And there’s the opportunity cost – just think of all the potential returns you’re forgoing by not investing in stocks or bonds (oh wait...).      The cash in your bank account is also unlikely to produce meaningful income. And we now have the very real possibility that banks will start to apply negative rates to cash holdings, as part of a mandated strategy to stimulate spending.      (Note that I’m not saying I agree with this rationale, just that it’s often trotted out. There’s an opportunity cost to not having cash around as well. And many renowned investors are flush with cash, preferring to have “dry powder” for when opportunities arise.)      A bigger-picture way to look at cash returns is the real yield, which incorporates inflation. We are already seeing a dip in inflation as spending plummets due to lockdowns, but once economies re-open and the stimulus checks are used to purchase everyday items made relatively scarce by supply chain constraints, inflation is likely to edge or even surge upwards.      This will push real yields on cash well into negative territory. Then, cash will indeed be “trash.” But at least its negative territory will be stable.      Let’s look at the yield outlook for government bonds. Even before the Federal Reserve abruptly cut its benchmark rate to 0 percent last month, U.S. bond yields were heading down across all maturities. Other government debt either carries a negative return or default and currency risk.      Corporate bonds offer higher yields, but a wave of defaults is more likely now than at any time in recent history. They don’t call it a risk premium for nothing.      Stock yields, which have recently been even higher than bonds, are likely to head sharply down as dividends are cut across the board.      Two assets that aren’t looking at lower yields? Gold and bitcoin.      Both are “real assets” in that they don’t have any income. Which means there’s no income to cut. Their value may go down as well as up but it will do so because of consensus market forces, not political interference or centralized decisions.      This adds a new nuance to the use of the word “real.” Both gold and bitcoin can be influenced by political priorities and economic measures, but their intrinsic value cannot. And both gold and bitcoin are relatively liquid instruments with sophisticated derivatives markets.      True, both are held in multi-asset portfolios valued in fiat currencies, and both largely depend on fiat currencies for their utility, for now. But of the two, only bitcoin can operate efficiently outside the fiat rails. Only bitcoin can be exchanged for other assets without going through a fiat conversion.      For now, this feature is limited to crypto exchanges that let you buy other crypto assets with bitcoin. It’s a start, and as traditional and crypto capital markets gingerly approach each other it’s likely to spread.      Admittedly, that will take time; meanwhile, the point is this: Unlike cash and securities, bitcoin is not vulnerable to centralized decisions on asset yields, and it can be used in a way similar to cash in asset purchases. It is the only quasi-cash equivalent that is resilient to the likely politicization of finance that results from the current ructions in markets and the broader economy.      Cash may be dissed by some who believe that yields should be a fundamental investment consideration; but everything in the investment world is relative. We could see attention start to coalesce around a potential alternative – not to cash itself, but to the role it plays in asset allocations. Bitcoin is by no means a cash substitute, at least not yet. It will, however, become an increasingly intriguing alternative for some of cash’s applications.    Market metrics    Markets were all over the place this week, with bitcoin dropping 8 percent between Monday and Thursday, only to rebound by almost 9 percent by Friday.      The S&P 500 was also volatile, clocking in a second weekly gain in a row for the first time since February, in spite of yet another staggering jump in unemployment claims, the worst retail sales data since 1992, the worst New York state manufacturing data since WWII and a relentless climb in COVID-19 casualties. Maybe expectations are just so bad that the actual news comes as a relief. Or maybe reality doesn’t matter anymore. I don’t know.      Not to be left out, gold is also doing weird things, with the spread between the spot and futures price widening to its highest level in 40 years. The spot price reached its highest point in seven years, which is confusing given the strong performance of the main equity index. I really need to dig deeper into what the problem is, if any, with physical delivery.    Digital currencies    It was an intense week for significant (albeit unsurprising) developments in global stablecoins. The Facebook-backed Libra Project has pivoted from a multi-currency-backed global token to a wallet and blockchain for single currency stablecoins as well as a multi-currency stablecoin-backed stablecoin (not a typo).      The idea of a “digital dollar” to facilitate stimulus payments has been reintroduced in the latest stimulus bill.      And my colleagues Wolfie Zhao and David Pan went deep into the Chinese national blockchain platform with global ambitions that could significantly impact the digital currency plans of central banks around the world.      Our chief content officer, Michael Casey, has launched a newsletter focused on the impact of these and other developments on our financial system. It's called “Money Reimagined,” and it comes out on Fridays – you can subscribe here, and read the latest issue here.      (Nothing in this newsletter should be considered investment advice. The author holds a small amount of bitcoin and ether.)    CHAIN LINKS    Renaissance Technologies’ flagship Medallion fund is considering adding cash-settled bitcoin futures to its holdings, according to a recent filing. TAKEAWAY: On the surface this may seem like a big deal: One of the world's largest and best-known hedge funds (the Medallion fund has nearly $10 billion AUM and is up 24 percent so far this year) believes bitcoin is worthy of investment. But, digging a bit deeper, it’s not that at all. Renaissance is a quant firm, which means it does not pay attention to underlying stories. It cares about correlations. Bitcoin exposure does not mean the managers see bitcoin as a revolutionary idea worth betting on; it's a number. Still, we should keep an eye on bitcoin futures volumes on the CME.      Silicon Valley venture firm Andreessen Horowitz is aiming to raise $450 million for a second cryptocurrency fund, according to the Financial Times. Its first crypto fund raised $350 million in 2018. TAKEAWAY: This is a pretty sizable vote of confidence in the sector’s potential, and not just through venture support for promising crypto-related companies. The investment may end up having an impact on the market itself – last year the firm registered all employees as financial advisers, enabling the fund to invest directly in crypto assets.      (You also might want to check out the company's explanation of how crypto business models are different from web business models. TL;DR: It’s not just the network effect that gives value, it’s also the ability to reward participation and redistribute economic value to participants in the network, creating a virtuous circle of increasing participation and value.)      Researchers at the Kansas City Federal Reserve published a paper about bitcoin’s correlation with bonds and equities, with some unexpected results. TAKEAWAY: This study is particularly interesting in that it differs from studies that look at overall correlations over time. This one isolates times of financial stress, when you arguably most need a safe haven, and it finds that during these times bitcoin acts more like a risk asset and has positive (yes, positive) correlations with the S&P 500.      Marcel Burger gives us a good overview of the evolution and current state of the crypto derivatives market, and explains why settling in BTC while quoting in USD turns the P&L from linear to non-linear. TAKEAWAY: Yet another peculiarity of trading in the crypto market. Outside of the FX markets, most traders won’t be used to this risk shift. This could be one of the reasons that BitMEX’s liquidation engine gets so much exercise. (For more detail, see also our “Crypto Derivatives” report.)      TradeStation is now offering crypto trading via an agreement with institutional-grade crypto exchange ErisX. TAKEAWAY: This in itself isn’t really news – TradeStation has been offering crypto trading for almost a year now, through its subsidiary TradeStation Crypto. What is surprising is the legacy financial firm (founded in 1982) is continuing to invest in crypto market infrastructure, even after the disruptions of March. Just being offered on TradeStation is not enough to boost investor interest in crypto assets – many investors will still be wary of the volatility and relative lack of liquidity. But the additional exposure, getting in front of its sizable client base, won’t hurt. The platform is even promoting crypto asset trading on its home page.      According to analytics firm Glassnode, the amount of bitcoin held on exchanges is at its lowest level since June 2019. TAKEAWAY: This could imply investors are moving their holdings off-exchange into custody, a sign selling pressure might be easing. In theory, you hold your bitcoins on an exchange if you are likely to want to trade them. If you’re planning on holding them for a while, you’ll probably move them to a safer storage.      Grayscale Investments* released their Q1 figures, revealing over $500 million in new investment, with almost 90 percent coming from institutional investors. TAKEAWAY: The growth is impressive, but it is unclear how much of the increase comes from contributions in kind – a popular trade amongst professional investors is to exchange bitcoin for shares in the Bitcoin Trust and sell after the lockup period, pocketing the premium the trust traditionally commands in the market. The relative reliability of this return means that not all of the inflow growth is from institutional investors excited by the potential of the cryptocurrency market. *Grayscale Investments is a wholly owned subsidiary of CoinDesk’s parent, DCG.      Greenidge Generation, an upstate New York power plant using proprietary facilities to mine bitcoin, has sold up to 30 percent of its computing power to institutional buyers. TAKEAWAY: This came out last week after I had finished the newsletter, but is worth flagging anyway because I am convinced we will see more traditional companies adapting their current installations to generate additional income through cryptocurrency mining. Keep an eye on other electricity generators and also on the oil and gas industry, where a lot of energy currently goes to waste and could be monetized through mining rigs. This would be very good news for the sector, as it would further decentralize the infrastructure and embed cryptocurrency in more mainstream business settings.      Shares of cryptocurrency mining firm Hut 8 Mining Corp. (HUT) rose 32 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Friday, on volume nearly eight times the daily average. TAKEAWAY: I don’t know what’s going on, but for perspective the shares are now back to where they were a month ago. The few listed shares with strong crypto exposure are worth keeping a close eye on not just as investment opportunities but also for what they teach us about sector economics. Mining companies are vulnerable to a sharp drop in revenue post-halving, but also stand to benefit from price upside.      Leah Callon-Butler describes how COVID-19 highlights a potential crypto-shaped lifeline for citizens of the Philippines, and how traditional finance organizations are getting involved. TAKEAWAY: For much of the world, the potential of bitcoin is not as an investment asset – it’s used as a payment method. This duality should produce some intriguing growth patterns over the coming years as both narratives move forward.      After the spike resulting from the mid-March crash, the volatility of the S&P 500 has stayed high, while that of bitcoin has fallen. TAKEAWAY: This is true of the 30-day volatility, but even so, bitcoin’s volatility is still higher than that of the S&P; longer term, the difference is even more apparent.      Open interest in bitcoin futures on the CME have rebounded since the March crash. TAKEAWAY: The levels are still low, and are not yet accompanied by noticeably higher trading volumes. They do, however, indicate a gentle recovery of investor confidence that the sharp volatility of mid-March is unlikely to return in the short term.      Google searches for “Bitcoin halving” are shooting up. TAKEAWAY: Not a surprise, but it is indicative of an uptick in mainstream interest in bitcoin and, since we’re still a few weeks away, is likely to trend much higher (going by what happened in the last halving in 2016).
