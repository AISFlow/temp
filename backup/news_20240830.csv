33010812,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638829,1725058842,Bitcoin Continues To Exit Exchanges As Supply Drops To New 2024 Low,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin supply sitting on exchanges has reached a new low for the year as investors continue to withdraw their coins. Bitcoin Exchange Reserve Has Been Riding A Downtrend Recently As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the BTC Exchange Reserve has continued its drawdown recently. The “Exchange Reserve” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin that’s currently sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric goes up, it means the investors are depositing a net number of tokens to these platforms right now. As one of the main reasons why investors would transfer their coins to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can lead to a bearish outcome for the asset’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Is Shooting Up: Will Shorts Be Rekt This Time? On the other hand, the indicator’s value heading in a downwards trajectory suggests the holders are withdrawing their BTC from the custody of the exchanges. Such a trend can be bullish for the cryptocurrency as it implies investors are in accumulation mode. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Exchange Reserve since the start of the year 2024: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Exchange Reserve has been declining throughout the year, implying that investors have constantly been shifting their coins off into self-custody. From the graph, it’s visible that a particularly sharp downwards move in the indicator has come as BTC has dropped under the $60,000 level, a potential sign that these coins taken off the exchanges were just freshly bought by their investors, who were looking to take advantage of the price dip. The drawdown that the Bitcoin Exchange Reserve has been witnessing during the last few months is naturally a positive development for the asset, as it means there is possibly lesser coins that can add to the selling pressure in the market. But the bullish effect on the price isn’t the only benefit for the cryptocurrency here, as the overall downtrend in the metric implies supply is becoming less concentrated on these platforms. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Depositing To Exchanges: Price To Drop Further? Exchanges are centralized entities and when investors deposit their coins into wallets associated with them, they lose real ownership over the coins (at least until they withdraw), with them coming under the management of the platform itself. This means that any mishaps with the exchange, whether a hack or something else, also ends up affecting its users’ holdings. As the FTX collapse showed back in 2022, large exchanges going through destabilization can also destabilize the entire market. Thus, the less the amount of the supply that these platforms hold, the less should their influence be on the sector. In this view, Bitcoin investors continuing to take their coins off into self-custody is naturally a constructive development. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $59,800, down 2% over the last seven days.

Amid this negative price action, the asset’s hash price, a key metric reflecting miners’ profitability, has reached historically low levels. According to a recent analysis by Woominkyu, a CryptoQuant analyst, this significant drop in hash price might signal a prime buying opportunity for investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reclaims $61,000: Key Levels To Watch For Continuous Surge Understanding The Hash Price And Its Relation To Buying Opportunity Woominkyu revealed in his analysis that the hash price, which measures the relationship between Bitcoin’s price and the revenue miners generate per unit of computational power, has shown a consistent pattern. When this metric falls to lower levels, it often coincides with Bitcoin’s price bottoming out. Woominkyu’s further shared a chart highlighting that the blue-shaded sections on the chart represent periods where the hash price dipped, corresponding to times when Bitcoin’s price was at or near its lowest points. The historical data suggests that these periods have been followed by significant price recoveries. Woominkyu believes that the current low hash price could indicate that Bitcoin is near a bottom, presenting a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors.

Cosmos’s largest achievement by far is the growing adoption of IBC as a cross-chain communication standard. IBC’s security while still being flexible and scalable makes it an attractive solution for cross-chain communication. Cosmos: $4.6 Reveals Significant Hurdle For ATOM’s Upside Potential ATOM is wrestling control of $4.6 in the short term with the bulls attempting to flip it to support. This bullish behavior suggests that investor sentiment has been strengthened by the recent on-chain developments that occurred within the last 2 weeks. Related Reading: XRP Gains Ground: 20% Of Institutional Investors Embrace The Crypto This leaves investors with an open road toward $6, but before this potential is realized, ATOM bulls should focus on the short-term flip of $4.6 as a support level. The token revisited this price level two times already; third if its current position is counted. This makes $4.6 both a significant support level and a hurdle for any upward potential. If the bulls fail to take this price level, the bears will eye $4 as a target. This places ATOM at a significant disadvantage with no solid support in the long term. However, bullish success on this level bodes well for ATOM as the token will stabilize on the $4.6-$5.1 range, giving enough wiggle room for short and medium term gains while securing a long-term solution for a climb toward $6.

33006532,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638907,1725047392,"Ethereum ETFs See $5 Million, ETH Built ICO Completes Over 85% Of Presale","The cryptocurrency market continues to experience significant growth, with Ethereum (ETH) playing a central role in this expansion. Recently, Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) saw a remarkable $5 million inflow, signalling strong investor confidence in ETH. Meanwhile, a new Ethereum-built Initial Coin Offering (ICO), Mpeppe (MPEPE), has successfully completed over 85% of its presale, capturing the attention of both seasoned and new investors. This article delves into the factors driving the popularity of Ethereum ETFs and the excitement surrounding Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s presale. Ethereum ETFs Attract $5 Million: A Testament to Growing Investor Confidence Ethereum ETFs have recently attracted $5 million in new investments, reflecting the increasing trust and interest in Ethereum as a foundational blockchain technology. These ETFs offer investors a way to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly purchasing and managing the cryptocurrency, making them an attractive option for institutional and retail investors alike. Why Ethereum ETFs Are Gaining Traction The surge in Ethereum (ETH) ETF investments can be attributed to several factors. First, Ethereum’s ongoing upgrades, such as the transition to Ethereum 2.0, are expected to enhance the network’s scalability, security, and energy efficiency. These improvements are bolstering confidence in Ethereum’s long-term viability and utility. Additionally, the growing adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), both of which are largely built on the Ethereum blockchain, has further solidified ETH’s position as a leading cryptocurrency. As a result, investors are increasingly turning to Ethereum ETFs as a way to capitalize on the anticipated growth in these sectors. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The ETH-Built ICO That’s Turning Heads As Ethereum ETFs continue to attract significant investment, another Ethereum-based project is making waves in the crypto world: Mpeppe (MPEPE). This new ICO has already completed over 85% of its presale, indicating strong demand and investor interest. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is more than just a token; it represents a movement that merges sports passion, blockchain innovation, and the transformative power of meme culture. The Future of Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Ethereum ETFs As Mpeppe (MPEPE) approaches the final stages of its presale, and Ethereum ETFs continue to attract substantial investment, the future looks bright for both. The ongoing development of the Ethereum network and the innovative projects built on it are likely to drive further interest and investment in the ecosystem. The Role of Ethereum ETFs in a Diversified Portfolio Ethereum ETFs, with their recent $5 million inflow, is proving to be a valuable addition to a diversified investment portfolio. As more institutional investors enter the cryptocurrency market, the demand for regulated investment vehicles like ETFs is expected to grow. This trend will likely drive further inflows into Ethereum ETFs, reinforcing their position as a key component of any crypto-focused investment strategy. Conclusion: A Promising Future for Ethereum-Based Investments The surge in Ethereum ETF investments and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s successful presale demonstrate growing confidence in Ethereum and its ecosystem. As Ethereum evolves and supports innovative projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE), investors have opportunities to participate in the cryptocurrency market growth. Combining Ethereum ETFs and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a strategic approach, providing stability and high-reward potential, allowing investors to benefit from both worlds.

This shift highlights the growing interest in innovative projects that combine entertainment with financial opportunity. Here’s why Ripple (XRP) holders are making the move to Mpeppe (MPEPE) and what this could mean for the future of both tokens.

Grayscale may need to lower GBTC’s fees to stay competitive. Until then, I don’t recommend investing in GBTC. Bitcoin’s recent price action suggests retail investors are accumulating and holding, awaiting institutional adoption. I base this assumption on ETF inflows and on-chain data. I remain bullish on Bitcoin as a potential global reserve asset, but success depends on uncertain institutional adoption (ultimately depending on human factors), making it a high-risk investment. GBTC loses its crown as the largest Bitcoin ETF: will Grayscale pivot? Earlier this year, I covered the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) as well as other Bitcoin ETFs. Back then, the GBTC ETF was the largest Bitcoin ETF by Asset Under Management ((AUM)), despite its uncompetitive 1.50% expense ratio, more than 5 times higher than competition. The situation in terms of AUM has changed since April, and significant outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF (worth around 20% of the fund) have made GBTC lose its crown in favor of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ). Grayscale’s GBTC ETF is still the second-largest Bitcoin fund at the time of writing, and now competes with Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ) for the third place on the podium by AUM. Prior to its conversion to an ETF in 2024, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust was launched in 2013 and represented one of the first publicly listed products that investors could use to get exposed to Bitcoin (BTC-USD). At the time, a 1.50% expense ratio was justified, in my view, given the lack of competition and how exotic Bitcoin was as an asset class. Nowadays, investors who have held GBTC when it was trading at a discount against its Bitcoin holdings have better options to cash out and/or hold onto their Bitcoin. Given its history, I am still keeping an eye on GBTC to see whether Grayscale will pivot by lowering its fees to make the fund more competitive. I expect Grayscale to seriously consider this pivot, given how radically the market for Bitcoin financial products has changed since 2013. Three Bitcoin ETFs have already lowered their expense ratio since their launch earlier this year - something I will cover in the next section. However, at this point in time my recommendation concerning the GBTC ETF remains that of last time I covered this fund: I see no reason to invest in Bitcoin via GBTC, due to its very uncompetitive expense ratio. Investors who have it in their portfolio may opt to hold for a few more months, to see whether Grayscale will indeed review its expense ratio to promote the fund. Bitcoin ETFs’ AUM growth: a signal of moderate retail interest Bitcoin ETFs comparison, key metrics (Author's elaboration of Seeking Alpha and Trading View data) The above table shows the evolution of inflows and outflows for the largest 9 Bitcoin ETFs in the market since April this year (the time I first published this chart). The loser of the Bitcoin ETF “battle” over the last 4 months has been - unsurprisingly - Grayscale’s GBTC ETF, with a loss of 20% in terms of AUM. The winner in my opinion is IBIT, which I continue to see as the best option to hold Bitcoin, partially because of BlackRock’s marketing and strategic focus on this fund. I am also calling out the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF ( BTCO ) and its impressive performance, growing AUM by a factor of 13 in less than 4 months. I see this growth as a direct result of Invesco’s choice to lower BTCO’s expense ratio to 0.25%, matching that of IBIT. Similarly to Invesco, WisdomTree also decided to lower the expense ratio of its BTCW fund to 0.25%. Franklin Templeton did similarly as well, with the expense ratio of the EZCB ETF now the lowest among the nine ETF in consideration, at 0.19% . I still do not consider either of these two ETFs as the best options for investors, given their somewhat limited liquidity. Overall, I interpret the total inflows of around 7% in these ETFs as a sign of moderate interest from retail investors for Bitcoin. I also see the expense ratio competition among Bitcoin ETF issuers as moderately bullish for Bitcoin. I will cover in more details my thoughts on Bitcoin price action in the next section of the article. BTC, GBTC and IBIT performance, YTD (Seeking Alpha) Going back to GBTC, I have already mentioned I do not see this fund as a viable tool to invest in Bitcoin. My recommendation is further confirmed by the Year-to-Date performance of Bitcoin against the IBIT and GBTC ETFs. As displayed in the above chart, GBTC is underperforming its only underlying holding (Bitcoin) on an YTD basis due to its high management fees. The fund is also underperforming IBIT, which has been closely tracking Bitcoin’s performance thanks to its lower 0.25% expense ratio. Entering Bitcoin now: retail interest won't be enough, but I’m still optimistic Moving beyond GBTC and into Bitcoin itself, I will spend the next few paragraphs to provide my thoughts on Bitcoin price action and whether I see the $ 60,000 per Bitcoin price level (Bitcoin’s price in USD at the time of writing) as an interesting entry point. First, to take a step back: I see Bitcoin as an asymmetric bet on its potential to mature into a global reserve asset, partly replacing gold and reserve currencies currently held by central banks and governments. Purely from a technical perspective, I think Bitcoin has all the characteristics needed to become a currency: It’s durable, stored on the blockchain and resistant to physical degradation. It’s divisible, with each Bitcoin able to be broken down into 100 million smaller units, called ""Satoshis."" It’s fungible, allowing any unit of Bitcoin to be exchanged for another. It’s portable, enabling easy digital transfer across the globe. It’s verifiable, with ownership and transaction history transparently recorded on the blockchain. It’s scarce, with a maximum supply limit of 21 million Bitcoins. However, from a political perspective, it still remains to be seen whether institutions such as governments, central banks, pension funds and retail banks will actually start adopting it as a reserve asset. Until that happens, Bitcoin remains a high risk asymmetric bet, in my opinion. In this context, I see Bitcoin’s price action in the last few months as a time of accumulation from retail investors in wait for institutional adoption. In other words, I believe retail investors are holding Bitcoin (via ETFs, Exchanges or self custody), waiting for institutional investors to start buying and for the cryptocurrency to mature . I base the above assessment on data about moderate ETF inflows (which I reviewed earlier in this article), as well as on-chain data. More specifically for on-chain data, I am considering the following two indicators: The number of Bitcoin active addresses , which saw a ~20% decline since the beginning of the year. This indicates, in my view, how retail investors are holding Bitcoin rather than trading or using it. The quantity of Bitcoin on exchanges , which is near 4 year lows. This indicates, in my view, retail investors moving their holdings in cold storage for long term holding. Overall, I reiterate my bullishness on Bitcoin as an asymmetric bet and I see current price levels as a good entry point. My bullish case for Bitcoin sees it maturing to match the market capitalization of gold, at roughly $650,000 per Bitcoin. My bearish case sees the cryptocurrency staying stuck in a tug-of-war between bulls and bears, and Bitcoin trading in a range between $ 40,000 and $ 100,000 per coin. I covered in more detail my bullish and bearish scenarios for Bitcoin in a past article , that I invite readers to consult should they be interested in gaining exposure to Bitcoin. Risks to my thesis Bitcoin remains a highly risky asymmetric bet. Even if I believe Bitcoin has the technical properties needed to be a great global reserve asset, it does not mean it will actually be adopted as such on a global scale. Whether or not Bitcoin will mature into a global reserve asset ultimately depends on geopolitics, political decisions and considerations from major global institutions. In other words, Bitcoin success ultimately depends on a human factor that is by definition very difficult to quantify and assess . I recommend people not to be overexposed to Bitcoin, and carefully consider whether the level of volatility and risk of this bet is consistent with their investment objectives and risk tolerance. In relation to GBTC, the main risk to my thesis is that Grayscale might pivot and lower the expense ratio of its fund to a very competitive level. If that were to happen, investors might eventually be better off holding GBTC rather than my current recommendation, IBIT. Conclusion I continue to see Bitcoin as an asymmetric bet on the cryptocurrency maturing into a global reserve asset. I do not believe Bitcoin will ever completely replace currencies in daily use, nor I think it will ever be used significantly in global commerce. However, I do see Bitcoin as a great (and better) alternative to gold and the US dollar in its capacity as global reserve currency. My bullish case sees Bitcoin maturing to match the market capitalization of gold, and reaching roughly $650,000 per Bitcoin. For the last four months, Bitcoin price action has been disappointing for investors expecting the cryptocurrency to rapidly mature into a global reserve asset. Based on inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and on-chain data, I believe Bitcoin retail holders are indeed “HODL’ing” their Bitcoin for the time being, waiting for institutions to start adopting it. As a result, I see the current price levels of Bitcoin as a good entry point to take this bet, given the potential upside in my bull case. However, investors should be wary of the risk in taking this bet. Bitcoin eventually reaching maturity depends on human factors, which is extremely difficult to predict and assess. In this context, Bitcoin ETFs are in my view the best way for retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. However, the GBTC ETF is not a good choice at the time of writing, due to its high expense ratio, at 1.50%. I do expect Grayscale to reconsider its fees and potentially pivot to make its Bitcoin fund competitive on the market. Should that happen, I will review once again GBTC and my “HOLD” recommendation.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4718244-what-gbtc-outflows-tell-me-about-bitcoin-and-the-bitcoin-etf-landscape?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/33006036.jpeg

CONY's performance has been poor, underperforming direct COIN stock investments. Income investors should avoid CONY due to its unpredictable returns and higher risk compared to more stable investment products. One of the most important companies in the cryptocurrency market in the United States is Coinbase ( COIN ). If you like Coinbase, you can buy the stock and sell it at a profit if you're correct about the company's future. If you really like it, you can leverage up with the GraniteShares 2x Long COIN ETF ( CONL ) which I just covered for Seeking Alpha recently - though I'll reiterate that I think that's a bad idea, personally. Obviously, there are also options strategies that individual traders/investors can play as well. But if these various methods of market wagering aren't enough, now one can even bet on people betting on COIN stock through options with the YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ). Fund Details CONY is casino draped in an income ETF wrapper. The goal of the fund is indeed to return capital to shareholders through distributions. However, since Coinbase doesn't actually pay a dividend to shareholders, distributions from an ETF that exists solely to play COIN options has to come from the premiums in the options strategy. Therefore, the fund never actually holds COIN stock. Rather, it has a synthetic long position from writing call options that cap any gain the ETF has if COIN stock takes a significant run higher. Fund Information CONY Gross Expense Ratio 0.99% AUM $633.3 million 30 Day SEC Yield 4.61% Inception 8/14/23 Source: YieldMax For an actively managed fund, the 1% gross expense ratio isn't terrible. For instance, the previously mentioned GraniteShares 2x Long COIN ETF has a 1.1% expense ratio. The 30-Day SEC Yield is nothing to sneeze at but that yield is far from predictable. In fact, the general trend in the fund's distribution has been down the last several months: CONY Distribution, rounded to penny (YieldMax, Author's Chart) At just $1.01 per share, last month's distribution was the lowest since the fund was launched a year ago. This wouldn't be as big of a concern if the price of the fund itself was stable. That has not been the case. Fund Performance The value of shares in CONY has been cut nearly in half from the peak earlier this year: Data by YCharts In a way, this is somewhat by design because the fund's distributions have been so large in previous months. The more appropriate way to judge CONY is by total return. Yet, even here we see a potential issue: Data by YCharts While 80% is certainly nothing to sneeze at in a single 12-month period, the total return of the fund has underperformed the stock that it's designed to provide synthetic long exposure to. And this is if CONY longs have been holding the ticker for 12 months. For CONY shareholders who bought the fund at the highs in COIN stock, it's difficult for me to see a benefit to this strategy: Data by YCharts In the chart above, I'm showing COIN against CONY since the end of March. The total return for CONY is admittedly less bad than that of COIN at just 21%. But I'm still scratching my head as to why anyone would do this instead of just buying Coinbase directly if they want long exposure to the company. The total return for CONY underperforms the stock when it rises and still goes down when it falls. If you expect the name to fall, you wouldn't want CONY exposure either. And I don't think the fall in COIN is over yet. Coinbase Chart and Valuation I try not to make my Seeking Alpha articles too TA heavy. But this is not a very good-looking chart to me: COIN Daily Chart 8/30/24 (TrendSpider) I see a stock with 50 and 100 day moving averages curling lower toward the 200. I see a stock that just fell below that 200 and now seems destined to revisit the early-August lows of $161 - indicating 10% downside from current levels. And I see a stock that has virtually no interest from the retail traders who would be theoretically more likely to put a bid on the name through calls indiscriminate of valuation. Speaking of which, COIN's valuation is way too high, in my opinion: Data by YCharts 10x trailing twelve months and 8x forward sales is not cheap in the financials sector and is, frankly, indicative of a stock that could very easily get cut in half and still be overvalued. As I mentioned in my CONL article from earlier this month, COIN has the ""F"" valuation grade from Seeking Alpha and either a ""D"" or an ""F"" in every individual metric: COIN Valuation 8/30/24 (Seeking Alpha) Final Takeaway If CONY harkens to the Selena Gomez scene in The Big Short to you, you are not alone. Perhaps calling CONY a 'derivative of derivatives' is an oversimplification as the goal of the fund is to ultimately return value to shareholders through distributions. It's just that the way those distributions are produced potentially carries more risk than from simply longing the stock directly if you're bullish COIN. In my view, income investors will do better generating returns from stable, predictable investments rather than playing the ponies with synthetic long strategies in cryptocurrency exchange stocks. I believe CONY is an avoid.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | ZRX,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4718242-cony-a-derivative-of-derivatives?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/33005744.jpeg

33004377,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638895,1725041522,Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Next Big Thing? FLOKI Investors Say Yes,"As the memecoin market continues to fluctuate, one emerging token, Mpeppe (MPEPE), is catching the eye of investors, particularly those who have been involved with Floki Inu (FLOKI). With its price currently at an attractive entry point, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is being hailed as the next big thing by some FLOKI holders who are seeking new opportunities in the volatile crypto landscape. FLOKI’s Rollercoaster: A Lesson in Volatility Floki (FLOKI), a popular memecoin, has seen its fair share of ups and downs. Recently, the token experienced a significant drop of 18.4% in just 24 hours, bringing its price down to $0.0001283. This decline came after a brief rally, driven by Binance’s announcement of a Simon’s Cat Token-Airdrop for FLOKI holders, which initially boosted the token’s price. However, the excitement was short-lived. The situation took a sharp turn when a dormant wallet, associated with Floki Inu, suddenly became active after 2.5 years of inactivity. This wallet transferred a staggering 15.22 billion FLOKI, worth approximately $2.27 million, to Binance just hours before FLOKI’s price plummeted. The large movement of tokens has raised concerns within the community, leading to speculations about the potential impacts on the token’s future. This incident underscores the inherent volatility of memecoins like FLOKI, where large transactions and market sentiment can drastically affect value. As FLOKI faces these challenges, investors are beginning to explore other promising options, with Mpeppe (MPEPE) emerging as a strong contender. Why FLOKI Investors Are Eyeing Mpeppe Given the current instability surrounding FLOKI, many of its investors are turning their attention to Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new and promising memecoin. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is gaining traction rapidly, with a growing community and a clear potential for significant price increases. Investors are particularly attracted to the token’s early-stage pricing, which offers the possibility of high returns as Mpeppe (MPEPE) gains popularity. For FLOKI investors, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents an opportunity to diversify their portfolios and mitigate risks associated with FLOKI’s recent volatility. With the right timing, investing in Mpeppe (MPEPE) could yield substantial gains, especially as the token prepares to enter broader markets. The Potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE): What’s Next? Mpeppe (MPEPE) is still in its early stages, making it a high-reward investment. However, the growing interest among FLOKI investors suggests that Mpeppe (MPEPE) could be the next big player in the memecoin market. As more FLOKI holders move their investments into Mpeppe, the token’s value is likely to see significant upward movement. Moreover, the current price of Mpeppe, combined with its increasing visibility in the crypto community, makes it an attractive option for those looking to capitalize on the next big memecoin wave. If Mpeppe continues to gain momentum, it could quickly become a staple in the portfolios of those who were early adopters of FLOKI. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Memecoin Investors For those invested in FLOKI, the recent market movements serve as a reminder of the importance of diversification. While FLOKI has proven to be a volatile asset, the emergence of Mpeppe offers a new opportunity to potentially achieve significant returns in the memecoin space. As FLOKI faces its challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioning itself as a strong alternative for investors looking to stay ahead in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency. With its promising outlook and growing community support, Mpeppe might just be the next big thing in the memecoin world.

33004259,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638892,1725041233,FLOKI Holder Buy Mpeppe Token At $0.001777 Before The Price Increases,"Recently, FLOKI holders have turned their attention to Mpeppe (MPEPE), a rising star in the memecoin universe, currently priced at just $0.001777. With the price set to increase soon, now might be the perfect time for those invested in FLOKI to diversify their portfolio and capitalize on the potential gains that Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers. FLOKI’s Rollercoaster Ride: A Cautionary Tale Floki (FLOKI) has been one of the most talked-about memecoins of 2024, drawing attention with its ambitious roadmap and a strong community of supporters. However, the coin has not been without its challenges. Recently, FLOKI experienced a sharp drop in value, losing over 11% in just a few days after a significant rally. This volatility is a reminder of the unpredictable nature of memecoins, which can surge to new heights but also crash just as quickly. Despite these fluctuations, FLOKI remains a significant player in the cryptocurrency market, and its long-term prospects still hold promise. The development team behind FLOKI is committed to keeping the momentum going, aiming to secure a spot among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. However, as FLOKI holders reassess their investment strategies in light of recent market trends, many are considering diversifying into other promising tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE), which is currently available at an attractive entry price. Why Mpeppe is Attracting FLOKI Investors Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly gaining traction among memecoin enthusiasts, particularly those who have already invested in FLOKI. With nearly 87% of Mpeppe (MPEPE) tokens sold during its current presale stage, the buzz around this token is growing. Investors are drawn to Mpeppe’s potential for significant price increases, especially as the presale price of $0.001777 is expected to rise soon. For FLOKI holders, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a fresh opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a new memecoin with substantial upside potential. The allure of early investment returns, coupled with Mpeppe’s strong community backing, makes it an appealing option for those looking to expand their portfolios beyond FLOKI. FLOKI’s Future: Can It Bounce Back? While FLOKI has experienced a recent downturn, it’s important to note that the coin has shown resilience in the past. The development team has laid out an extensive roadmap aimed at ensuring FLOKI’s long-term success, including plans for expanding its ecosystem and increasing utility. These efforts could help stabilize the coin and potentially lead to another rally in the future. However, the days of FLOKI delivering 100x returns may be behind us, as the coin has already achieved a significant market capitalization. This reality is prompting many investors to explore other options, like Mpeppe (MPEPE), which still has the potential for explosive growth as it enters the broader market. The Perfect Timing for Mpeppe For those looking to buy into Mpeppe (MPEPE), the timing couldn’t be better. As FLOKI holders seek to diversify their investments, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a unique opportunity to capitalize on a token that is still in its early stages. With its price expected to increase soon, getting in at $0.001777 could yield significant returns once Mpeppe (MPEPE) hits the exchanges. Moreover, the current market environment, with its high volatility, is ideal for memecoins like Mpeppe (MPEPE), which thrive on speculative investment. As more FLOKI holders and other investors flock to Mpeppe (MPEPE), the token’s price is likely to see substantial upward movement, making now an opportune moment to invest. Conclusion: Diversification is Key In the ever-changing world of cryptocurrency, diversification is essential for managing risk and maximizing returns. For FLOKI holders, adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolios could be a strategic move, offering the potential for high returns while spreading investment risk. As the presale nears its end and Mpeppe (MPEPE) prepares to enter the wider market, the token’s price is poised to increase. This makes it an attractive option for those looking to capitalize on the next big memecoin. By investing in Mpeppe (MPEPE) at $0.001777, FLOKI holders could position themselves for significant gains in the near future. In conclusion, while FLOKI remains a strong contender in the memecoin space, the potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE) should not be overlooked. As the market evolves, smart investors will recognize the value in diversifying their holdings and seizing opportunities like Mpeppe (MPEPE) before the price rises.

33004135,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638890,1725040890,"Tron, BNB and MPEPE a Combination You Must Have In Your Crypto Wallet","In the world of cryptocurrencies, diversification is key to mitigating risks and maximizing returns. As we look ahead into 2024, three assets are emerging as must-haves for any serious crypto investor: Tron (TRX), Binance Coin (BNB), and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Each of these tokens brings something unique to the table, and together they offer a balanced portfolio that can thrive in various market conditions. Tron (TRX): A Resilient Player with Long-Term Potential Tron (TRX) has proven itself as a resilient and adaptable asset in the volatile crypto market. With predictions for 2024 showing a potential price increase to $0.196, Tron (TRX) continues to be a reliable choice for investors looking for steady growth. The technical analysis suggests that TRX is developing a bullish reversal pattern, which could see it challenging its all-time highs in the coming years. Tron (TRX)’s roadmap is filled with technological advancements and increasing adoption, making it a solid choice for those looking to hold onto a cryptocurrency that has the potential to deliver consistent returns over the long term. As TRX continues to integrate into global finance and decentralized applications, its value proposition will only strengthen. Binance Coin (BNB): Stability in a Volatile Market Binance Coin (BNB) has long been a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market, thanks to its association with the Binance exchange, one of the largest and most influential crypto platforms globally. Recently, Binance Coin (BNB) has entered a period of consolidation, with reduced volatility as its 20-day EMA and 50-day SMA flatten. This consolidation phase indicates a potential breakout, which could see Binance Coin (BNB)’s price surge to $560.90 if bullish sentiment prevails. The current market conditions suggest that Binance Coin (BNB) is less likely to experience wild price swings, making it an attractive option for investors seeking stability in their portfolios. The reduced volatility, as confirmed by the ATR and Bollinger Bands, suggests that Binance Coin (BNB) is in a phase where significant price movements are less likely, making it a safer bet for conservative investors. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Rising Star with Explosive Potential Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly gaining traction as one of the most exciting new tokens in the crypto space. With nearly 87% of its tokens already sold in the presale stage, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capturing the attention of both meme coin enthusiasts and serious investors. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s rise is not just about hype; it’s supported by a growing community and a strong use case that could see it delivering explosive returns in the near future. For those willing to take on a bit more risk in exchange for the possibility of high rewards, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an opportunity that is hard to ignore. Its rapid ascent and strong community backing suggest that it could be one of the standout performers in 2024. Why This Trio Belongs in Your Crypto Wallet Investing in a combination of Tron (TRX), Binance Coin (BNB), and Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides a well-rounded approach to cryptocurrency investment. Here’s why: Diversification: Each of these tokens offers exposure to different aspects of the crypto market. Tron (TRX)’s long-term growth potential, Binance Coin (BNB)’s stability, and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s high-risk, high-reward profile combine to create a balanced portfolio. Risk Management: By holding assets like Binance Coin (BNB), which is currently in a consolidation phase with low volatility, investors can mitigate some of the risks associated with more volatile assets like Mpeppe (MPEPE). Growth Potential: All three tokens have strong growth potential. Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB) are established players with clear roadmaps, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers the chance to capitalize on the next big thing in the crypto world. Conclusion: The Perfect Trio for 2024 and Beyond As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, holding a diversified portfolio is more important than ever. Tron (TRX), Binance Coin (BNB), and Mpeppe (MPEPE) each bring something unique to the table, making them essential components of any crypto wallet in 2024.

33003810,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638885,1725040118,3 Reasons Why You Should Purchase Solana And Mpeppe In 2024,"As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, investors are constantly on the lookout for promising assets that could offer substantial returns. In 2024, two tokens have captured significant attention: Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Both of these assets present unique opportunities, and here are three compelling reasons why you should consider adding Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe to your portfolio this year. 1. Solana’s Growing Dominance and Resilience Solana (SOL) has rapidly emerged as one of the leading blockchain platforms, often compared to Ethereum for its high-speed transactions and lower fees. Despite facing challenges in 2024, including market volatility and struggles to maintain key support levels, Solana (SOL) remains a top contender in the blockchain space. Solana’s resilience is evident in its ability to hold above the $140 mark, even as broader market conditions fluctuate. The approval of a Solana ETF has further solidified its position, making it an attractive option for institutional investors. Analysts predict that Solana (SOL) could see a significant price surge, with some forecasts suggesting a rise to $500 in the short term and potentially reaching $1,000 in the long run. Moreover, Solana’s innovative approach to scalability through its unique combination of Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms ensures that it remains a fast and efficient blockchain. This technical prowess, coupled with a strong developer community and growing ecosystem, makes Solana a must-have for any crypto portfolio in 2024. 2. Mpeppe’s Explosive Growth Potential While Solana (SOL) has already established itself as a major player, Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents the next big opportunity for exponential growth. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s presale has been a resounding success, with nearly 87% of the tokens sold in the current stage, signaling strong demand and investor confidence. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s appeal lies in its innovative approach to combining meme culture with real-world utility, making it a standout in the crowded meme coin market. The token’s momentum is further bolstered by its strategic marketing efforts and the growing interest from prominent investors who recognize its potential for substantial returns. With Mpeppe (MPEPE) priced at just 0.001777 USDT per token in its current presale stage, early investors have the opportunity to secure a position in a project that is poised for massive growth. As the token continues to gain traction, the potential for 100x returns becomes increasingly likely, making Mpeppe (MPEPE) an enticing option for those looking to capitalize on the next big trend in crypto. 3. Diversification and Strategic Positioning In the ever-changing world of cryptocurrency, diversification is key to managing risk and maximizing returns. By investing in both Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), you position yourself to benefit from the strengths of two very different but equally promising assets. Solana (SOL) offers stability and long-term growth potential, backed by a robust blockchain infrastructure and a thriving ecosystem. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides the excitement of a high-reward opportunity, driven by its unique market positioning and explosive growth potential. Together, these two assets offer a balanced approach to crypto investing in 2024. Solana’s established presence and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s rapid ascent create a complementary investment strategy that caters to both conservative and aggressive investors. By holding both tokens, you can benefit from the stability and innovation of Solana (SOL) while also capturing the upside potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE). Conclusion: Seize the Opportunity in 2024 As the crypto market continues to mature, identifying the right assets to invest in becomes increasingly important. Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) represent two of the most compelling opportunities in 2024, each offering unique advantages that cater to different investor profiles. Solana’s proven track record and innovative technology make it a cornerstone for any long-term crypto portfolio, while Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s rapid growth and market potential offer the chance for extraordinary returns. By investing in both, you can diversify your portfolio, manage risk, and position yourself for success in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency. Don’t miss out on the opportunities that Solana and Mpeppe (MPEPE) present in 2024. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to the crypto space, these two tokens should be on your radar as you plan your investment strategy for the year ahead.

33003652,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638883,1725039664,Mpeppe Token Gains Traction Amidst Solana’s Bullish Sentiment,"As Solana (SOL) continues to solidify its position in the cryptocurrency market, the excitement surrounding the blockchain is spilling over into other promising projects, particularly Mpeppe (MPEPE). With nearly 87% of MPEPE tokens already sold in the current stage, it’s clear that investors are taking notice of the potential this casino token holds, especially as Solana’s market position strengthens. Solana’s Ascendancy: A New Challenger to Ethereum In recent months, Solana (SOL) has rapidly gained ground, challenging Ethereum’s dominance in the blockchain space. As Ethereum struggles with high transaction fees and scalability issues, Solana has emerged as a faster and more cost-effective alternative. Its unique combination of Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms allows it to process transactions in just 0.4 seconds, far outpacing Ethereum and other major blockchains. Solana’s ability to handle a high volume of transactions at low costs has attracted a significant number of decentralized applications (dApps) and users, leading to its rise to the fifth position in the cryptocurrency rankings. As more projects and investors migrate to Solana, the blockchain’s influence and market share are expected to grow, further establishing its reputation as a potential “Ethereum Killer.” Mpeppe (MPEPE): Riding the Wave of Solana’s Success The growing success of Solana (SOL) has not gone unnoticed by investors looking for the next big opportunity. Mpeppe (MPEPE), a casino token with the potential for 150x returns, has quickly gained traction, particularly among those who have been following Solana’s rise. With 86.91% of its tokens sold in the current stage, MPEPE’s popularity is a clear indication of the confidence that investors have in its future. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is designed to revolutionize the decentralized gambling space, offering a unique and engaging experience for users. The token’s success in its presale stages has been remarkable, with over 1.3 billion tokens already sold. As the current stage nears completion, the token’s price is expected to rise from $0.001777 to $0.0021, offering early investors a lucrative opportunity to lock in significant gains. The timing of Mpeppe’s rise couldn’t be better, as Solana (SOL) continues to capture the attention of the crypto community.

The Future of Mpeppe and Solana: A Symbiotic Relationship As Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) continue to grow in popularity, their futures are likely to be closely intertwined. Solana’s (SOL) superior transaction capabilities make it an ideal platform for projects like Mpeppe that require high throughput and low fees. In turn, the success of Mpeppe and similar projects will contribute to the overall growth and adoption of the Solana blockchain. While Solana (SOL) has already established itself as a formidable contender in the blockchain space, the ongoing development and launch of new projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) will play a crucial role in determining its long-term success. As more investors recognize the potential of Solana and the projects built on it, both Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are poised for significant growth.

33003562,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638880,1725039450,Solana Investors See Massive Upside in Mpeppe’s 150x Casino Token,"As the broader cryptocurrency market faces bearish conditions, Solana (SOL) investors are looking for alternative opportunities to generate significant returns. One such opportunity is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a casino token that has caught the attention of savvy investors. With Solana (SOL) recently dipping below $140, the timing seems perfect for those seeking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on emerging trends like Mpeppe (MPEPE), which promises up to 150x returns. Solana’s Current Market Struggles Solana (SOL) has been under significant pressure, recently falling below the $140 mark. The token has been in a downtrend for nearly a week, with its value dropping by almost 14% in the last six days. This decline has seen Solana break through several key support levels, including the 200-day EMA, indicating a bearish sentiment. The potential formation of a Double-Top pattern suggests further downside, with the next critical support level at $129. Despite these challenges, technical analysis from platforms like CoinCodex offers a glimmer of hope. Their predictions indicate a possible 14.57% rise in Solana’s value by the end of September, targeting a price of $159.93. However, with the RSI nearing oversold territory and the MACD signaling further bearish momentum, many investors are hesitant to buy more Solana (SOL) at this time. Why Solana Investors Are Turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE) In the face of Solana’s (SOL) bearish outlook, many investors are turning their attention to Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new casino token that has shown immense promise. Currently, 87% of the MPEPE tokens in the ongoing presale stage have already been sold, reflecting strong investor interest. At the current price of $0.001777 per MPEPE, the token offers an attractive entry point for those looking to capitalize on its 150x potential. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is designed to revolutionize the decentralized gambling space, offering a unique blend of entertainment and financial reward. The token’s success in its early stages has been nothing short of remarkable, with over 1.3 billion tokens already sold. As the presale nears completion, the price is expected to increase to $0.0021 in the next stage, offering early investors a chance to secure significant gains. For Solana (SOL) investors, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents an opportunity to diversify into a high-growth area with substantial upside potential. The token’s appeal lies not only in its innovative approach to decentralized gambling but also in its ability to attract a broad audience, including those disillusioned by the recent downturn in the Solana market. Solana’s Future Outlook and the Case for Mpeppe (MPEPE) While Solana (SOL) may eventually recover from its current slump, the timing of that recovery remains uncertain. The bearish indicators, including the RSI and MACD, suggest that Solana could face further declines before finding a stable support level. This uncertainty makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) an even more compelling option for those looking to hedge their bets. Solana (SOL) has a strong community and solid technical foundations, but its current market conditions have left many investors seeking alternatives. Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a fresh opportunity, with the potential for massive returns that are increasingly hard to find in more established tokens like Solana (SOL). As more Solana (SOL) investors recognize the upside potential in Mpeppe (MPEPE), the token’s value could soar, especially as it moves closer to its next pricing stage. With the broader market showing signs of volatility, diversifying into promising new tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE) could be a strategic move for those looking to maximize their returns. Conclusion The recent struggles of Solana (SOL) have prompted many investors to explore new opportunities, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out as a highly attractive option. With its 150x potential and strong presale performance, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised to become a major player in the decentralized gambling space. For Solana (SOL) investors looking to diversify and capitalize on emerging trends, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a compelling case for inclusion in any crypto portfolio.

Adding to downward pressure is an ICO whale known as “0xe17.” Since July 9, this whale has been aggressively depositing large amounts of ETH onto exchanges. Some of the moves he made included sending 48.5K ETH to the OKX exchange. Of that, 38.5K ETH was deposited in the month leading up to the first major price drop on August 5. Another big whale, “0x682, also faced accusations of contributing to the market’s decline. It transferred a sum total of 25K ETH worth $73.9 million to Kraken exchange on two occasions. In fact, each of the transfers was before the observed price drops and furthered the decline. Bullish Signals Amidst The Bearish Trend Despite the downturn in recent times, some analysts still remain very optimistic about Ethereum’s future. Cryptorphic presented a bullish case for Ethereum, adding that the leading cryptocurrency has an important area of support between $2,184 and $2,348. This range has indeed proved quite sturdy, as ETH recently reclaimed it after a serious market pullback. At the moment, Ethereum changes hands at $2,559, according to Cryptorphic, close to testing the 35-day EMA resistance, a key level for the cryptocurrency. ETH Technical Analysis in a 2-Day Timeframe ETH is holding decent support within the $2,184-$2,348 range. A few weeks ago, when the market experienced a major correction, ETH dropped to this same support range and bounced back. With the price currently at $2,520, ETH is likely… pic.twitter.com/43Is9sOtYB — Cryptorphic (@Cryptorphic1) August 28, 2024 If ETH manages to close above this key level, it would potentially indicate further upside toward testing a higher resistance level at $3,750. This projection gives some hope to traders who believe in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Related Reading: Crypto Crash: $320 Million Wiped Out As Bitcoin And Ethereum Nosedive Ethereum: RSI Points To A Possible Reversal Technical indicators provide some cause for cheer, though. The RSI, one of the leading momentum indicators, is drawing back from the oversold level, which could suggest that the bears are running out of steam and the bulls are likely to gather strength. That shift in momentum might set the stage for a quicker move higher in price, especially if Ethereum can break through key levels of resistance. Attention would now be turned to key support between $2,184-$2,348, an area that has been instrumental in preventing further downside so far. If bulls were to prevail, key areas of interest would come in at $2,930, with secondary targets at $3,750. Ethereum clearly stands at the threshold, posing either a strong recovery or further consolidation.

The poll results, released Friday, found that crypto holders are disproportionately likely to say they will vote for Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Half of all crypto-holding survey respondents said they planned to vote for Trump, while only 38% of crypto owners preferred Harris.  Among non-crypto owners, the statistics were flipped, with Harris leading by 12 points: 53% of voters who’ve never owned crypto said they would vote for Harris, and 41% planned to vote for Trump.  “Trump has been reaching out to the crypto community, and it seems to have paid off,” said Dan Cassino, professor of Government and Politics at Fairleigh Dickinson and executive director of the poll, in a Friday press release. “It might be easy to dismiss them as insignificant, but I don’t think people realize exactly how widespread crypto ownership is.”  In Fairleigh Dickinson’s poll, which captured responses from over 800 registered voters nationally earlier this month, 15% of respondents said they owned or had owned cryptocurrencies or non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The percentage of respondents who say they own crypto is roughly comparable to findings of other recent surveys.  Read more: Most People Cringe About Crypto But Enough Care to Warrant Politicians’ Attention  The poll found that crypto owners tend to disproportionately be young men and members of racial minority groups, with 13% of White voters saying they’ve owned crypto compared to 17% of Black voters and 22% of Hispanic voters.  “Historically, Republicans have had a hard time reaching young people and people of color,” said Cassino. “Support for cryptocurrencies is very much a wedge issue that could win over voters that otherwise look more like Democrats.”  The crypto industry has spent lavishly on political contributions this election cycle, with one study finding that nearly half of all corporate contributions to political action committees (PACs) this year had come from crypto companies like Coinbase – the top corporate spender in the 2024 cycle – and Ripple.

42417304,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTY5CX,1725033286,"Bitcoin Slips Back to $58K in Continued Desultory Action, but Next Week Could Offer Upside Excitement","Bitcoin's flat-to-downward price action continued on Friday, with the crypto now lower by 12% in August  There's been a noticeable pattern of prices rising during Asia trading hours and falling during U.S. hours over the past couple of weeks  Volatility might just return to the upside next week alongside a fresh batch of U.S. economic data  In what's become a pattern over the past couple of weeks, bitcoin {{BTC}} is again trending lower during U.S. trading hours, the price sliding back to $58,000 just before noon on the east coast.  Currently at $58,200, bitcoin is down just shy of 4.4% over the past 24 hours, outperforming the broader market gauge CoinDesk 20 Index's 5.6% decline. Ether {{ETH}}, Chainlink (LINK) and Cardana {{ADA}} are among the index constituents dropping more than bitcoin. Having the worst session is Solana {{SOL}} with a 9% decline.  A bit more than 24 hours from the close of August, bitcoin has tumbled more than 12% for the month, more than reversing what had been a strong July. Ether is now lower by 25% for August, narrowing its year-to-date gain to just 7%. Solana is also off 25% for August and posting a 31% year-to-date advance.  Buy Asia, sell the U.S.  Those thinking there's a familiarity to this lame price action are not imagining things. ""Asia bids, America dumps,"" wrote Miles Deutscher earlier on Friday. The cumulative return for bitcoin during Asia trading hours over the past two weeks has been more than 5%, according to Deutscher, while the crypto has posted a negative return during U.S. hours.  ""Like clockwork,"" he added minutes ago as bitcoin once again sold off in the U.S. morning.  Change in trend ahead?  The positive catalysts of growing institutional adoption, a possibly friendlier regulatory environment, and coming Federal Reserve rate cuts have done little for the bitcoin price, which is off more than 20% since hitting an all-time high near $73,500 more than five months ago.  Bulls at this point might have a hard time imagining if there's anything at all that might shake up the poor action. It could get exciting when the U.S. returns from the Labor Day holiday next week, however, as a new wave of economic reports might alter the macro picture.  Headlining the data next week will be the Friday Sept. 6 Nonfarm Payrolls Report for August. The July jobs report was a weak one and likely was the final straw forcing the Fed's hand in promising a September rate cut. Currently, however, market expectations are for only a meek 25 basis point cut in mid-September. A second consecutive weak jobs print, though, might have investors quickly pricing in a 50 basis point move by the central bank, delivering a strong positive jolt to risk markets, bitcoin among them.  The flip side, of course, would be a strong September employment report and the subsequent tempering of the market's outlook for easier monetary policy. Whatever happens, volatility likely lies ahead, and there's probably about a 50% chance it's to the upside. At this point, the bulls would happily take those odds.",NEUTRAL,BTC | SOL,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/30/bitcoin-slips-back-to-58k-in-continued-desultory-action-but-next-week-could-offer-upside-excitement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f8b4279503f82ca1b59924280cd2b6257a09d994-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The first of these, the Open Interest, keeps track of the total amount of derivatives contracts related to Bitcoin, whether short or long positions, that are currently open on all exchanges. When the value of this metric goes up, it means the investors are opening up fresh positions on the market right now. As new positions generally come with an increase in the overall leverage present in the sector, this kind of trend can lead to higher volatility for the asset. On the other hand, the indicator’s value observing a decline implies investors either are closing up positions of their own volition or are getting liquidated by their platform. The coin’s price may become more stable following this trend. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest over the past few days: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest had taken a plunge earlier as a result of the cryptocurrency’s decline towards the $58,000 level, which had induced the liquidation of a significant amount of long positions. After observing some sideways movement, the metric has been on its way back up again, suggesting investors have been opening new positions. This speculative activity can naturally lead to more volatility for the asset. In theory, such volatility can take the asset in either direction, but depending on the composition of the positions present on the derivatives market, one direction may be more probable than the other. The indicator that sheds light on the structure of the sector is the second metric of interest here: the Funding Rate. This indicator basically keeps track of the amount of periodic fee that traders on the derivatives market are exchanging between each other. From the chart, it’s visible that the Bitcoin Funding Rate has been negative during this recent Open Interest increase. When the metric has a negative value, it means the short holders are paying a premium to the longs in order to hold onto their positions, so the new positions that have appeared in the sector recently would be short ones.

Because of the short-heavy market, it’s more likely that these investors betting on a bearish outcome get caught up in a mass liquidation event, thus taking Bitcoin is a more bullish direction. It only remains to be seen, though, as to how BTC’s price action would play out in the coming days. BTC Price Bitcoin had seen a brief rebound above $61,000 yesterday, but the coin appears to be back down under $60,000 today.

33000770,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24068,1725030598,Are NFTs Collectibles or Securities?,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a Wells Notice to OpenSea, the leading NFT marketplace, signalling a potential lawsuit based on the classification of certain NFTs as securities. This regulatory move represents a new phase in the SEC’s scrutiny of the NFT market and raises concerns about the future of digital art and collectibles. By targeting OpenSea, the SEC could set a precedent that impacts not only NFT platforms but also creators and developers, within this rapidly evolving corner of the digital asset space. The SEC Targets the NFT Industry The recent Wells Notice delivered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to OpenSea marks a pivotal moment for the NFT industry. The notice indicates that the SEC is considering classifying certain NFTs on the platform as securities , which could lead to significant legal challenges for OpenSea and broader implications for the NFT market. This development is notable given the expansive nature of NFTs, which range from digital art and collectibles to in-game assets and even event tickets. If the SEC moves forward with enforcement, it could set a precedent that would impact not only NFT platforms but also the creators, artists, and developers who rely on these platforms to distribute their work. OpenSea, as one of the largest NFT marketplaces, has been a central hub for digital artists and collectors. The SEC’s potential action could derail the industry by imposing regulatory burdens on creators who may lack the resources to navigate complex securities laws. The broad application of securities law to NFTs could lead to discouraging artists from exploring new technologies and mediums. This is especially troubling in a space where digital art and collectibles have provided new avenues for creative expression and economic empowerment. The legal uncertainty surrounding NFTs has been a growing concern, and the SEC’s approach to regulation by enforcement rather than providing clear guidelines adds to this. By targeting OpenSea, the SEC is venturing into territory that could extend beyond the NFT space to other forms of digital and physical collectibles. The industry is now faced with the challenge of defining the legal status of NFTs, which could have far-reaching consequences for the future of digital art and decentralised platforms. In response to the SEC’s actions, OpenSea has pledged $5 million to support the legal defence of NFT creators and developers who may also face similar challenges. This move underscores the platform’s commitment to protecting the creative community and ensuring that innovation in the NFT space can continue. However, the outcome of this legal battle could shape the trajectory of the NFT industry for years to come, making it a critical issue for all stakeholders in the digital art and crypto communities. What is a Wells Notice and What Kind of Ramifications Does This Have? A Wells Notice is a formal communication from the SEC indicating that the agency is considering bringing an enforcement action against a company or individual for potential violations of securities laws. It outlines the charges being contemplated and gives the recipient an opportunity to respond before any formal charges are filed. The ramifications of a Wells Notice can be significant, particularly for a company like OpenSea, which operates in the emerging NFT market. If the SEC proceeds with enforcement, it could lead to legal action that not only impacts OpenSea but also sets a broader precedent for how NFTs are regulated. This could potentially reclassify many NFTs as securities, subjecting them to strict regulatory requirements, which might deter innovation, affect market dynamics, and create costly legal challenges and regulatory barriers for artists, creators, and platforms operating within the NFT space. Sweeping enforcement measures like the SEC’s potential action against OpenSea could have far-reaching ramifications beyond just cryptocurrency and NFTs, potentially extending into other types of collectibles such as physical art, trading cards, and even memorabilia. If the SEC successfully argues that NFTs should be classified as securities due to their potential for investment and resale, it could set a precedent for regulating a wide range of collectibles that have historically been treated as commodities or personal property, not financial securities. Traditionally, securities have been defined as financial instruments like stocks, bonds, and investment contracts, which are tied directly to the financial performance of a company or enterprise. Extending this definition to include collectibles simply because they might appreciate in value or be resold could impose burdensome regulatory requirements on a vast array of goods that are currently outside the purview of securities law. Such an interpretation could stifle markets, hinder innovation, and create legal uncertainties across industries that deal in collectibles. Artists, creators, and collectors might be forced to navigate complex legal frameworks designed for financial products, potentially dampening the appeal and accessibility of these markets. The broad application of securities law in this manner could have a deleterious effect on creativity and innovation, as creators might avoid exploring new forms of digital and physical art out of fear of regulatory repercussions. This may also impact traditional collectibles in unforeseen ways with sweeping negative impacts on a wide array of collectible products that were not under the SEC’s purview, previously. Do Collectibles Suddenly Become Regulated Securities Just Because They’re Digital? The question of whether collectibles suddenly become securities because they’re digital touches on a critical issue in the evolving landscape of digital assets. Traditionally, collectibles, whether physical or digital, have been treated as commodities or personal property, not securities. Their value is typically driven by factors like rarity, demand, and the reputation of the creator or brand, rather than by the expectation of profit tied to the efforts of a third party, which is a key criterion in defining securities under the Howey Test . However, as digital collectibles, particularly NFTs, have gained prominence, regulatory bodies like the SEC are beginning to scrutinise whether these assets should be classified differently, given their potential for speculation and resale in secondary markets. The argument that digital collectibles could be considered securities often hinges on their perceived investment potential. NFTs, for example, are often bought with the expectation that their value will increase over time, especially if they are part of a popular collection or associated with a well-known artist. This expectation of profit could, in theory, bring them under the umbrella of securities law. However, this interpretation is problematic because it conflates the nature of collectibles with that of financial instruments designed specifically for investment purposes. Just because an item can appreciate in value and be resold does not necessarily make it a security; otherwise, many traditional forms of collectibles, from baseball cards to fine art, would also fall under this category, which they historically have not, and would previously have been considered ludicrous. The application of securities law to digital collectibles could create significant legal and practical challenges. The art market, for instance, has operated for centuries without being subject to securities regulation, even though art pieces are frequently bought and sold as investments. Extending this regulatory framework to digital art and collectibles simply because they are traded on blockchain platforms could impose unnecessary burdens on creators and collectors, have a negative impact on the industry as a whole and potentially limit the accessibility of these markets. It could also lead to inconsistent and confusing regulatory environments. Many would argue that digital collectibles should not automatically be classified as securities simply because they exist in a digital format. While the potential for investment and resale might be more apparent in the digital realm, such products are also viewed.as collectibles. Opponents of any classification of NFTs as securities argue that regulatory bodies need to carefully consider the implications of broadening the definition of securities to include digital assets, as doing so could have unintended consequences for a wide range of markets. Instead, it has been suggested that a more nuanced approach that distinguishes between genuine investment products and collectibles, whether digital or physical, would better serve the interests of both consumers and creators.

The Future of Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Its Impact on TRX and BNB As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to gain momentum, its impact on the Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB) communities is becoming increasingly apparent.

High transaction costs, liquidity constraints, and a uniquely inefficient 'rolling' mechanic should cause structural underperformance vs. the underlying going forward. Despite some niche use cases, BITO's structure results in substantial performance drag, making it a sub-optimal long-term investment. We re-iterate our 'Sell' rating on BITO. In February of this year, we wrote an article titled, "" BITO: Why Bother? "". The point of the article was simple - in an age of newly legalized Spot Bitcoin ETFs, why invest in the inferior, futures-based alternative ? In years past, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) might have made sense as an investment, as it was one of the only ways to get price exposure to Bitcoin in a traditional brokerage account. However, as new products have come onto the scene - many of which that feature lower fees, less tracking error, and better tax treatment - it's been getting harder and harder to see where this fund fits into a modern portfolio. Today , we wanted to re-visit and re-iterate our initial thesis on BITO, cover the fund's recent performance, and highlight why we think the ETF is poised to underperform its underlying cryptocurrency well into the future. Let's jump in. How BITO Works In case you missed our initial article, BITO is a Bitcoin-tracking ETF that is meant to give investors exposure to the price of Bitcoin through a fully regulated product. The Fund invests into Bitcoin Futures, which meet regulatory approval and are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ((CME)). Here's more info on this setup, directly from the horse's mouth : ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (the ""Fund"") seeks investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to the performance of bitcoin. The Fund currently seeks to achieve this objective primarily through investments in bitcoin futures contracts . The Fund does not invest directly in bitcoin. CME's futures began trading in late 2017, but it took several years - all the way until the end of 2021 - for BITO to launch. As we just mentioned, the fund buys and holds Bitcoin futures, and here you can see the fund's positions as of Q3 2024: ProShares This shows that the fund is primarily invested into treasuries and other cash-like instruments, and then it uses those positions as a margin to fund futures positions that roll every so often as the futures expire. Problems With BITO As we see it, there are three key problems with BITO's structure: Transaction Costs , Taxes, and the Expense Ratio . Let's dig into each of these. First off , BITO, as a futures-oriented fund, pays a lot of fees in transaction costs that get subtracted from your returns as an investor. As a billion-dollar+ fund, BITO has significant liquidity constraints that drive costs up. Larger trades lead to wider spreads and less efficient pricing vs. the market. Additionally, given that BTC futures are mostly in contango, the fund will consistently 'sell low' and 'buy high' the core asset, which leads to additional costs: TradingView Here's more info on this from the prospectus: Futures contracts with a longer term to expiration may be priced higher than futures contracts with a shorter term to expiration, a relationship called ""contango."" When rolling futures contracts that are in contango, the Fund will sell the expiring contract at a relatively lower price and buy a longer-dated contract at a relatively higher price. Finally, the inbuilt trading increases base commissions and transaction costs, which eat into profits. Between rolling costs, liquidity constraints, and commissions, BITO has a very high-cost structure that is built into the DNA of the fund. This leads to severe tracking errors, which is something we'll look at in the performance section in a minute. Aside from the transaction costs , BITO's 'rolling' procedure can create monthly, mandatory distributions to investors that are taxed as ordinary dividends , not qualified dividends. That means that unless you hold this fund in an IRA, your otherwise unrealized investment gains are crystallized on a monthly basis and shipped back to you to be taxed, which creates a huge drag over time. Lastly , BITO's expense ratio stands at 0.95%, which is a lot higher than other non-leveraged BTC products on the market today: TradingView All of these may seem like 'small things', but added together, and cumulatively over time, it can lead to some pretty big differences in performance that we'll take a look at now. BITO's Performance If you're just looking at BITO on a standalone basis, the performance looks somewhat familiar to a regular BTC chart. Launched in 2021, the fund's performance suffered through the crypto bear in 2022, and has since perked up as BTC has done better through 2023 and 2024: TradingView Of course, this takes distributions into account. If you're not re-investing these dividends, then your position is down quite a bit since inception: TradingView That said, some of the issues don't come out until you dig in and begin comparing the fund's performance over time to other assets. Remember those transaction costs we talked about? Year-to-date, they haven't been too bad, and BITO is tracking IBIT pretty closely over time, with only a 5% tracking error: TradingView That said, if you zoom this out and compare BITO to BTC's spot performance since the end of 2021, the difference is a lot starker: TradingView Same instrument, same index, same underlying instrument. The only difference here is how BITO's transaction fees and distributions cause significant tracking errors over time vs. the underlying target. If you were to invest $100,000 into BITO and spot bitcoin from inception, BITO's costs would have eaten up about $19k in performance difference over time, given the ~1900ish bips of differential. That's also not taking into account taxes, which may have compounded this effect. IBIT , the iShares spot product, has tracked spot bitcoin almost perfectly since inception, by contrast: TradingView Given the availability of better, cheaper, wrappers for investing in BTC, it's hard to label BITO as anything but a 'sell'. To be clear - we're not saying anything about BTC in and of itself, but BITO, as a wrapper, we think is a poor long-term instrument. Can BITO Be Useful? Despite all of the issues we see with BITO, there are still two scenarios in which BITO might be the best choice. First off , BITO uses regulated futures, which means that the funds are locked up and safe within the fund structure. With IBIT and other products, they buy spot bitcoin directly, typically through a centralized exchange. This means that IBIT and other buyers are outsourcing their asset security to Coinbase ( COIN ) (or other custodians), which have hacking risk. In the event that COIN gets hacked, it's likely that BTC would drop substantially in price, but it would leave BITO shareholders better off vs. those in IBIT that may have seen their funds fully withdrawn away. There are some insurances to protect against this, but it's tough to know how and when those would pay out in the event of a catastrophe. The other use case is for leveraged speculation. Right now, BITO is one of the only non-leveraged BTC instruments that has options trading enabled. The SEC hasn't yet approved options for spot bitcoin ETFs, which means that if you're looking to hedge, speculate, or run an income strategy on BTC exposure in a regulated environment, BITO might be your best option (no pun intended). Summary All in all, though, despite the niche use cases, we think BITO appears to be a sub-optimal medium- or long-term investment product as a result of the fund's high fee structure and suboptimal tax treatment, which will likely cause continued tracking error over time vs. the underlying. This leaves us no room to do anything but re-iterate our 'Sell' rating.

While Solana has shown relative strength compared to other altcoins, the recent price action has introduced heightened volatility and potential risks for investors. Related Reading: Solana Price (SOL) Slips: Will a Break Below $140 Trigger More Downside? Fear and uncertainty currently dominate the market, with key data from Coinglass revealing a bearish sentiment among traders. This sentiment shift reflects the broader market concerns as Solana approaches this crucial support level. The coming days will be pivotal in determining whether Solana can stabilize or face additional downside pressure. Notably, some top investors are waiting for a decline to the $130 area, a shy 7% drop from current prices, as a potential entry point. Given the current market environment, traders and investors are closely monitoring Solana’s performance at this level to gauge its next move. If Solana holds its ground, it could indicate resilience and potential for recovery; however, a failure to maintain this support could lead to further declines. Solana’s Funding Rate Turns Negative Solana’s recent decline has turned traders bearish, at least in the short term. Crucial data from Coinglass reveals that the funding rate for SOL has turned negative for the first time since August 23. A negative funding rate indicates that short positions now outweigh long positions, meaning traders are paying to maintain their short bets against SOL. This shift in sentiment suggests that traders are increasingly expecting further declines in Solana’s price. Adding to the bearish sentiment, several traders and analysts are anticipating a drop towards key support levels. Top trader AlienOvich on X shared an analysis suggesting that Solana could fall further, targeting the $135-$128 area. If Solana fails to hold its current levels, this bearish scenario could materialize, bringing Solana closer to AlienOvich’s predicted range. Such a decline would not only validate the bearish sentiment currently driving the market but also challenge Solana’s ability to maintain its recent gains. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Could Drop To $8 If It Loses Current Support: On-Chain Data Reveals The next few days will be crucial for Solana as it tests these lower levels. Traders will be closely watching to see if Solana can find support or if the negative sentiment will push the price down further. As the market reacts to this pressure, Solana’s ability to recover and potentially bounce back will be key to determining its short-term trajectory. Solana Price Action Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $139.87, significantly below its daily 200 moving average (MA) of $152.28, and is now testing the daily 200 exponential moving average (EMA) after briefly dipping below it. The primary distinction between these two indicators is that an EMA is a weighted average, giving more importance to recent data points, while an MA treats all data points equally. For SOL to hold this critical support level, it needs to reclaim the EMA and consolidate around the $140 mark. Failing to do so could lead to a further decline toward the lows seen on August 5. This price level is crucial for determining whether SOL can maintain its current uptrend or if it will continue to face downward pressure. Traders are closely watching this level, as losing it might indicate a deeper correction is imminent.

32996541,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638770,1725021053,"BNB Battles Persistent Bearish Pressure, Will $500 Be The Next Stop?","BNB is currently under increasing bearish pressure, potentially setting it on a path toward the $500 mark. As sellers strengthen their control, the cryptocurrency seems poised for a further drop to this crucial support level, raising the question, will BNB manage to break through these bearish barriers and move toward its target, or will it give in to the ongoing downtrend? This article aims to dissect the current bearish pressure weighing on BNB and evaluate its potential to reach the $500 mark. We will delve into key technical indicators, market sentiment, and potential scenarios to offer a clear perspective on BNB’s journey and its potential to navigate through the ongoing downtrend toward this crucial target. Bearish Trends In Focus: Is $500 On The Horizon? An analysis of the ongoing bearish trend and its impact on BNB’s price target reveals that, on the 4-hour chart, BNB’s price is currently trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), indicating negative momentum. The cryptocurrency has formed three consecutive bearish candlesticks, suggesting that selling pressure is intensifying and could further drive the price down toward the $500 mark. Additionally, on the 4-hour chart, both the signal line and the SMA of the Composite Trend Oscillator have dropped below the zero mark and are trending in the oversold zone, with no signs of crossing back up. This positioning highlights that bearish pressure continues to dominate the market, indicating the potential for additional price declines. On the daily chart, BNB has shown significant bearish movement below the 100-day SMA following a failed attempt to break through at $605. This downward trend reflects strong selling pressure and pessimistic market sentiment, increasing the likelihood that the cryptocurrency could decline toward the $500 mark. Finally, the 1-day composite trend oscillator indicates sustained bearish pressure for BNB. The signal line has fallen below the SMA of the indicator, with both lines approaching the zero mark. As prices continue to struggle, this positioning highlights ongoing downbeat sentiment and implies that negative market conditions may persist. Potential Reactions: How Will BNB Move Post-$500? If BNB successfully reaches the $500 mark and encounters resistance, the price could start to climb toward the $537 resistance mark. Should it break through this resistance, BNB may continue to ascend, with the next significant target being the $605 resistance level and potentially higher levels beyond. Conversely, if BNB breaks through $500 with strong momentum, it could trigger a persistent decline toward the $454 support level. When this support is breached, BNB could target even lower levels, potentially heading toward $357 or below.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,891 −1.6%  Bitcoin (BTC): $59,574 −0.6%  Ether (ETH): $2,516 −1.5%  S&P 500: 5,591.96 −0.0%  Gold: $2,553 +1.1%  Nikkei 225: 38,647.75 +0.74%  Top Stories  Crypto prices were muted as the week drew to an end, with bitcoin 0.7% lower in the last 24 hours at $59,500. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, has dropped 1.5%. Bitcoin extended its week-long slide after last week’s rally, with major exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recording net outflows amid signs of waning demand. BTC is on track to end August at an 8% haircut (with one day to go), the steepest drop since April. Overall bitcoin demand growth remains low and has even turned negative in the last few weeks.  Dogecoin is one of the few tokens to buck the trend, rising nearly 0.7%. A Manhattan judge dismissed a lawsuit that alleged Elon Musk and Tesla manipulated the price of DOGE by exploiting Musk's social media influence and public statements. Statements cited in the suit included his claims to ""become Dogecoin's CEO,"" put a ""literal Dogecoin in SpaceX and fly it to the moon,"" and that ""Dogecoin might become the standard for the global financial system."" Judge Alvin Hellerstein said the statements were ""aspirational and puffery,"" not factual claims, and thus, no reasonable investor would rely on them.  Crypto startup Bridge, which wants to build a global stablecoin-based payments network, recently raised $40 million in fresh funding, taking the total raised to $58 million. The startup, which was founded by Square and Coinbase alumni Zach Abrams and Sean Yu, aims to ""enable companies to use a stablecoin rail without thinking about it,"" Abrams said in an interview with Fortune. Bridge, whose customers include SpaceX and Coinbase, aspires to become a Web3 version of payments processor Stripe, operating as a global payments system into which other developers can integrate seamlessly. Earlier this year, Stripe itself said it planned to add crypto payments through Circle's USDC stablecoin.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows that every single MSCI country stock index is currently above its 200-day moving average.  When this figure surpasses 90%, it can be a signal for exuberant bullishness and thereby potential correction risks.  Stock market movement can be seen as an indicator of cryptocurrency movement as the two are affected by many of the same factors.

32996127,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638824,1725019893,All Bets on Mpeppe: Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) Holders Make Bold Move in the AI Gambling Space,"The world of cryptocurrency is never short on surprises, and the latest buzz centers around the unexpected but strategic move by holders of Fetch AI (FET) to dive into the burgeoning AI-powered gambling market through Mpeppe (MPEPE). This bold shift signals not only a growing interest in decentralized gambling but also the potential for significant synergies between artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Let’s delve into how Mpeppe is capturing the imagination of Fetch AI (FET) holders and what this could mean for the future of both AI and gambling. The Rise of AI in Blockchain: A Perfect Match? Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) has long been at the forefront of integrating AI with blockchain technology. With its sophisticated autonomous agents and the AgentVerse platform, Fetch AI has demonstrated how AI can be leveraged to optimize a wide range of tasks, from managing electric vehicle charging stations to enhancing user experiences in decentralized applications. However, the recent downturn in the cryptocurrency market has put pressure on Fetch AI (FET)’s price, leading investors to explore alternative avenues for growth. Enter Mpeppe (MPEPE), a decentralized gambling platform that is harnessing the power of AI to revolutionize the online gambling industry. With its promise of transparency, security, and a fair gaming environment, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly become a beacon of opportunity for those looking to invest in the next big thing. For Fetch AI (FET) holders, who are already well-versed in the potential of AI, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a natural extension of their investment strategy. Why FET Holders Are Flocking to Mpeppe The decision by Fetch AI (FET) holders to pivot towards Mpeppe (MPEPE) is more than just a response to market conditions—it’s a calculated bet on the future of AI and decentralized finance (DeFi). Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s platform is built on the premise that AI can not only enhance the fairness and efficiency of gambling but also create new opportunities for innovation within the industry. One of the key attractions of Mpeppe (MPEPE) for Fetch AI (FET) holders is its unique approach to decentralized gambling. Unlike traditional platforms, Mpeppe (MPEPE) uses AI algorithms to ensure that games are not only fair but also adaptive, providing a dynamic and engaging experience for users. This level of innovation is something that resonates deeply with Fetch AI (FET) investors, who see the potential for AI to disrupt industries far beyond its current applications. Additionally, the growth potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE) is hard to ignore. With its ongoing presale and growing community support, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized gambling market.

32996056,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638820,1725019715,Playdoge vs. Mpeppe: Which Meme Coin is the Next Dogecoin?,"Two meme coins, Playdoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), have captured significant attention, each with its own unique appeal and potential to become the next Dogecoin (DOGE). With the Playdoge (PLAY) presale nearing its end and Mpeppe’s rise in the decentralized gambling space, the question on every investor’s mind is: which of these meme coins will be the next to explode? Playdoge: The Nostalgic Tamagotchi Meets Doge Playdoge (PLAY) has taken the concept of nostalgia to a new level by combining the beloved Tamagotchi game with the iconic Doge meme. The Playdoge (PLAY) project has been a hit among early investors, raising nearly $6.5 million during its presale, which is set to end in just a few hours. The excitement around Playdoge (PLAY) is palpable, as it brings back the charm of caring for a virtual pet while integrating modern Play-to-Earn (P2E) mechanics. In Playdoge (PLAY), players can interact with their Shiba Inu virtual pets, feeding, grooming, and playing with them to earn $PLAY tokens. The more attention and care they give to their pets, the more rewards they can accumulate. These tokens can be used for in-game purchases or exchanged for other cryptocurrencies, making them versatile and valuable. With the game’s imminent launch on Google Play and the Apple App Store, Playdoge (PLAY) is positioned to attract a wide audience of both gamers and crypto enthusiasts. The potential for the token to be listed on major exchanges like Binance adds another layer of excitement, as a listing could significantly boost the token’s value. Mpeppe: The New Contender in Decentralized Gambling On the other side of the spectrum is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme coin that has quickly gained traction in the decentralized gambling arena. Unlike Playdoge (PLAY), which focuses on gaming and nostalgia, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is carving out a niche for itself in the gambling sector, where it aims to revolutionize the industry with its innovative use of AI and blockchain technology. Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a unique platform where users can engage in a variety of gambling activities, all powered by a decentralized system that ensures fairness and transparency. The token has attracted a diverse group of investors, including those from Playdoge (PLAY), who see the potential for massive returns as the platform grows. What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart is its focus on integrating AI to enhance the gambling experience. By using AI algorithms, Mpeppe can offer personalized gaming experiences, improve odds calculations, and provide real-time analytics to help users make informed decisions. This technological edge, combined with the growing interest in decentralized gambling, positions Mpeppe as a strong contender in the meme coin space. Which Meme Coin Has the Edge? While both Playdoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) have their unique strengths, the decision on which meme coin is the better investment ultimately depends on the investor’s goals. Playdoge (PLAY) offers a fun and engaging gaming experience with the potential for significant returns, especially with its upcoming listings on major exchanges. Its nostalgic appeal and strong community support make it a compelling choice for those looking to invest in a token with a solid foundation and clear growth potential. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is appealing to investors who are looking for something more innovative and forward-thinking. The integration of AI in the gambling industry is still in its early stages, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is at the forefront of this movement. For those willing to take a risk on a token that could redefine an entire sector, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an exciting opportunity with the potential for exponential growth. Conclusion: The Next Dogecoin? In the battle between Playdoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), both tokens have the potential to achieve Dogecoin-like success. Playdoge (PLAY)’s strong presale performance and upcoming game launch make it a strong candidate, especially for those who value nostalgia and gaming. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach to decentralized gambling and its use of AI set it apart as a token to watch in the coming months. For investors, the choice between Playdoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) will depend on their investment strategy. Those who prefer a more traditional, game-focused investment might lean towards Playdoge (PLAY), while those looking to bet on the future of decentralized gambling may find Mpeppe (MPEPE) to be the more exciting option. Regardless of the choice, both tokens offer the potential for significant returns, making them worthy contenders in the race to become the next Dogecoin.

32995995,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638817,1725019554,Mpeppe’s 100x Potential Gains Traction From Playdoge Investors,"In recent times certain crypto projects stand out not just for their innovative concepts but for the fervent community that rallies behind them. This year, two names have risen to prominence, catching the eye of seasoned investors and crypto enthusiasts alike: Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Playdoge (PLAY). Both projects are riding the wave of meme coin popularity, but what happens when these two forces converge? The result could be nothing short of explosive. The Rise of Mpeppe: A New Player in the Crypto Arena Mpeppe (MPEPE), a relatively new entrant in the meme coin sector, has quickly garnered attention with its promise of 100x potential gains. The project taps into the decentralized gambling sector, offering a unique proposition that blends the viral nature of meme coins with the high-stakes excitement of online gambling. With the crypto market known for its volatility, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach is designed to attract risk-tolerant investors looking for the next big win. But Mpeppe (MPEPE) isn’t just another meme coin riding on hype; it has substance behind the buzz. The platform’s integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the gambling experience sets it apart from other projects. This AI-driven approach allows Mpeppe (MPEPE) to offer personalized gaming experiences, improve odds calculations, and provide real-time analytics, making it a compelling option for both casual and serious gamblers. As a result, the project has started to attract attention from a diverse range of investors, including those heavily involved in the Playdoge (PLAY) community. Playdoge Investors Take Notice Playdoge (PLAY), a play-to-earn platform inspired by the nostalgic Tamagotchi toys, has been making waves in the crypto community with its innovative gameplay and lucrative staking rewards. Operating on the Binance Smart Chain, Playdoge (PLAY) allows players to nurture virtual Doge pets and earn $PLAY tokens through various in-game activities. With its engaging concept and the potential for high returns, Playdoge (PLAY) has successfully raised nearly $6.5 million in its presale, capturing the interest of thousands of investors. As Playdoge (PLAY) prepares for its official listing, the community’s excitement has reached a fever pitch. However, it seems that many Playdoge (PLAY) investors are not content with sticking to just one promising project. The allure of Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s 100x potential has caught their attention, leading to a significant influx of investment from the Playdoge (PLAY) community into Mpeppe (MPEPE). This cross-pollination of investment is more than just a coincidence. It represents a strategic move by savvy investors who recognize the complementary nature of both projects. While Playdoge (PLAY) offers a fun and engaging way to earn rewards through gaming, Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides an opportunity to tap into the lucrative world of decentralized gambling. Together, they form a potent combination that could yield substantial returns for those willing to take the plunge. The Synergy of Meme Coins The synergy between Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Playdoge (PLAY) is not to be underestimated. Both projects leverage the power of meme culture to build strong, dedicated communities, but they also offer tangible value beyond mere speculation. Playdoge (PLAY) provides an immersive gaming experience that resonates with a wide audience, while Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s AI-driven gambling platform offers a fresh take on online betting. This combination of entertainment and financial opportunity is what makes these projects so appealing to investors. As more Playdoge (PLAY) holders diversify their portfolios by adding Mpeppe (MPEPE), the potential for both tokens to rise in value increases. The shared community between these two projects creates a network effect, where the success of one can positively impact the other. This interconnectedness is a hallmark of successful crypto ecosystems, where collaboration and shared enthusiasm drive growth and innovation. Looking Ahead: A Bright Future for Mpeppe and Playdoge (PLAY) The future looks bright for both Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Playdoge (PLAY). With the former poised to revolutionize the decentralized gambling space and the latter set to dominate the play-to-earn sector, investors have plenty of reasons to be optimistic. The influx of Playdoge (PLAY) investors into Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a strong signal that this project is here to stay. As the crypto market continues to evolve, the partnership between Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Playdoge (PLAY) could serve as a model for how meme coins can transcend their origins and become valuable assets in their own right. For investors, the message is clear: those who act now, diversifying their holdings with both Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Playdoge (PLAY), may be positioning themselves for substantial gains in the months and years to come. In conclusion, the 100x potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE) is gaining serious traction, thanks in large part to the influx of investment from the Playdoge (PLAY) community. This winning combination of innovative technology, engaging gameplay, and strong community support could very well make Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Playdoge (PLAY) the next big success stories in the world of cryptocurrency.

32995929,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638814,1725019346,ETH Whale Eye Up Dropping $3.2m Across Playdoge and Mpeppe,"As the crypto market continues to ebb and flow with volatility, significant moves by whale investors can often signal pivotal moments for emerging projects. Recently, an Ethereum whale has caught the attention of the crypto community by reportedly planning to drop a staggering $3.2 million across two of the most talked-about meme coins in the market: Playdoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). This potential investment could be a game-changer for both tokens, positioning them for massive gains in the near future. Playdoge: The Next Big Thing in Play-to-Earn Gaming? Playdoge (PLAY) has been generating substantial buzz in the crypto world, particularly as its presale draws to a close. With over $6.3 million already raised, this play-to-earn (P2E) game is capturing the imagination of both gamers and investors alike. Playdoge (PLAY) offers a unique blend of nostalgia and innovation, allowing users to raise digital pet doges in a manner reminiscent of the classic Tamagotchi game from the 90s. But unlike its predecessor, Playdoge (PLAY) rewards players with $PLAY tokens for taking good care of their virtual pets. According to crypto analyst Jacob Bury, Playdoge (PLAY) is primed for a potential 10x price rally when it launches on exchanges this week. Bury points to the project’s strong fundamentals, its position on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and the current market conditions as key factors that could drive significant gains. “Playdoge (PLAY) is launching at a time when users are seeking the next BSC meme coin with big potential. This could be the perfect storm,” Bury said. The timing seems impeccable, as the broader crypto market shows signs of a downtrend. However, leading traders are reportedly accumulating Playdoge (PLAY) tokens, viewing the current dip as a buying opportunity. With Playdoge (PLAY) set to launch on exchanges in less than 24 hours, the anticipation is building, and the potential for explosive growth is becoming increasingly likely. Mpeppe: Revolutionizing Decentralized Gambling with Meme Coin Appeal While Playdoge (PLAY) focuses on the play-to-earn model, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is making waves in the decentralized gambling space. Mpeppe (MPEPE) combines the viral nature of meme coins with the excitement of online gambling, offering a platform where users can participate in AI-enhanced betting games. The project’s innovative approach has attracted a diverse range of investors, including those from the Playdoge (PLAY) community. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s potential lies in its ability to disrupt the traditional gambling industry by offering a decentralized, AI-driven alternative. This unique value proposition has not gone unnoticed by the crypto community, and with an ETH whale reportedly eyeing a significant investment, Mpeppe (MPEPE) could be on the cusp of a major price surge. The $3.2 million investment from the Ethereum whale, if it materializes, would be a strong vote of confidence in both Playdoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Such a move could not only boost the price of these tokens but also increase their visibility and credibility in the crowded crypto market. The Perfect Timing for a Strategic Move The crypto market is notoriously unpredictable, but timing remains a crucial factor in maximizing returns. For the ETH whale, the decision to invest heavily in Playdoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) comes at a moment when both projects are poised for significant breakthroughs. Playdoge (PLAY)’s presale success and imminent exchange listing, coupled with Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach to decentralized gambling, create a compelling case for this strategic move. As the broader market continues to grapple with volatility, the ETH whale’s potential $3.2 million investment could serve as a catalyst for both tokens, driving them toward the much-anticipated 100x returns. For investors who have been on the fence, this could be the signal they’ve been waiting for. In conclusion, the combination of Playdoge (PLAY)’s play-to-earn gaming appeal and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s revolutionary approach to decentralized gambling makes them a formidable duo in the meme coin space. With an ETH whale potentially entering the fray, the future looks bright for both projects. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to the crypto world, keeping an eye on Playdoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) could pay off in a big way.

Since then, Bitcoin's been on a long road to nowhere, with little price gains. On-chain metrics moved from being extremely bearish to neutral. Bitcoin’s usage, as measured by the number of active addresses, is lackluster. Sentiment dramatically shifted from extremely greedy to fearful. Speculation has declined in both Bitcoin and the overall cryptocurrency market; however, Bitcoin’s susceptible to another decline if equities weaken this fall. Introduction It's been six months since I became very Bearish on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). In that SA article entitled Bitcoin: ""Beware the ides of March"" I warned that the vast majority of indicators were saying there's a short-term top (or ""local top""). Also, two of the most powerful catalysts (spot ETF, Halving Event) I telegraphed in the ""Bitcoin: Number Go Up"" article already occurred. Since then, Bitcoin's digested its previous gains, with several drawdowns of 10-20% as it range-trades. I believe that Bitcoin remains a risk asset for now, despite its narrative of being ""digital gold."" My macro framework is that we have a U.S. recession or a slowdown by the very least. This would put downward pressure on all risk assets. On-Chain Technical Analysis (""OCTA"") aka On-Chain Metrics One thing I've learned the hard way is that one needs to utilize a consistent set of indicators, else you can become swayed from anecdotal news. After two decades of equity market timing, I've figured, more-or-less, how to transfer this skill towards digital assets. The key is to find confluence among indicators that are based on different data-sets. So if I have three charts saying that investors are too giddy (a ""bad thing"") I would count that as only one. Another useful way of analyzing assets is using a holistic approach - applying fundamentals, technicals and trend lines. I often describe OCTA as technical analysis on steroids, as it brings in real fundamental data. I rely on three firms: Glassnode (paywall) Cryptoquant and Token Terminal for OCTA analysis. Some of the major categories are those that measure: Blockchain Usage Investor Profitability Long-term holder behavior Liquidity Derivative Positioning Miner Activity Sentiment For the most part, these can be found on-chain, depending on what metric you're looking at. For the purposes of this presentation, I will also be looking at ""off-chain metrics"" for Sentiment and Liquidity. Blockchain Usage (Active Addresses) Active addresses' growth remains lackluster. There are expanding use-cases for Bitcoin, such as Ordinals (i.e., NFTs) and the Lightning Network (for payments, remittances, etc.), however, this isn't showing up in the data. Several folks informed me that it's due to the popularity of the Bitcoin ETFs, which are custodied differently than having personal wallets. However, active addresses' growth was lackluster even before the ETFs were approved. Very concerning... glassnode Investor Profitability (Percent Supply In Profit) I usually look at the MVRV ratio, but for simplicities' sake, I'm showing the Percent of Bitcoin Supply in Profit. It's come down sharply to 80% after peaking early this year. Essentially, when investors have high profits, there's a tendency to want to sell Bitcoin and cash out of the market. Right now, we're at ""equilibrium"" levels. Net Effect: Neutral. glassnode Long-Term Holder ((LTH)) Behavior Given the above high profitability, the largest (mostly Whales) long-term holders aggressively sold as Bitcoin approached its all-time high early this year. The heavy distribution is typically seen at major market tops, especially considering that the ratio of LTH to STH (Short-term holder) supply dropped precipitously as ""weaker hands"" bought aggressively at the top. The good news is that LTH have started accumulating again and could provide a floor to Bitcoin's price. Net effect: somewhat Positive. glassnode On-Chain Liquidity (Net Capital Flows) I'm introducing the chart below as a way of examining liquidity within the Bitcoin blockchain. Capital flows into Bitcoin shot up $217Bn since Bitcoin's Major Bottom (~ $15K in Dec'22). However, these flows have dissipated over the last few months (green area chart below). Net effect: Negative. glassnode Liquidity (""Off-Chain"" Global Liquidity) Liquidity is one of the most important factors affecting ""long duration"" assets, including cryptocurrencies. There are several ways to measure liquidity, such as gauging interest rates. However, I favor Global Liquidity which is measured by the size of central bank balance sheets (netted with Repos, etc.). Since bottoming in 2022 (along with Bitcoin), global liquidity has been trending upwards, and I expect this to accelerate once the Fed lowers rates. Net effect: Positive. Milk Road via CrossBorderCapital Derivatives Positioning (Funding Rates) There are a few ways of determining speculation in derivatives - we can look at Futures, Options, or implicit leverage related to liquid staking. When leverage or open-interest rises too quickly, this could portend high risk of cascading liquidations. Funding rates on perpetual futures also describe investor sentiment. At the current time, rates are neutral, meaning Bitcoin's in equilibrium and there isn't aggressive buying of Bitcoin futures. The large red lines show time-periods when traders were selling futures during the Terra-Luna ( LUNA-USD ), FTX ( FTT-USD ) and the Regional Banking crises. I also cross-checked with Binance's "" Long/Short"" ratio, which also attests to the market's equilibrium. Net Effect: Neutral. CryptoQuant Miner Activity (Puell Multiple) The Puell Multiple was invented by David Puell who's now at Ark Invest . This metric looks at the supply side of Bitcoin's economy. The Puell Multiple is calculated by dividing the daily issuance value of bitcoins (in USD) by the 365-day moving average of daily issuance value. Values above 2 are considered ""bad"" and near a local top and 0.4 (green dotted line) is considered ""good"". The Puell Multiple is at 0.7 as of this writing and is down sharply from the 2 level when I last wrote this article-topic . (Note: the sharp decline is attributed to April's Bitcoin Halving.). Net effect: Neutral. I also think it's important to examine other data such as the Hash Rate (which is at an all-time high and increases costs to miners) as well as the financial health of Bitcoin Miners, as they are usually forced to sell Bitcoin when their balance sheets are weak. As of August, miners have eased their Bitcoin selling on exchanges and many are benefiting by providing AI datacenter services given their access to low-cost energy and computational infrastructure. Again, this indicator went from Bearish to Neutral. CryptoQuant Sentiment (Off-Chain ""Fear & Greed"") When I last wrote this OCTA article, Sentiment was outright giddy, peaking at the 90 level on March 5th. More recently, it has oscillated between moderate-Fear and the Neutral range. This is a good reading and usually coincident with a local bottom. Another positive factor is that the MEME coin faze has markedly slowed. If you want to verify this for yourself, have a look at Solana's revenues , which have slowed. (Solana is one of the favorite blockchains for MEME coins and NFTs.) Net effect: Positive. Alternative.me Closing Remarks: The long-term case for Bitcoin is stronger than ever, hence my ""Buy"" rating. Remember, there are 13.7MM coins being HODLed for dear life (including 3MM lost coins) and just 21MM in total max-supply. However, since my last article, we've been on a roller-coaster - up and down but going nowhere. I remain cautious that an equity drawdown could pull-down Bitcoin's price further. My guess is that Bitcoin could decline to the $40s level but no lower given that the Spot market is in control and leveraged bets are low. Further, this level is associated with the approval of the Spot ETFs, so it acts as a support level. Cross your fingers that we make it through September (chart below), Bitcoin's weakest month. Then we're off to the races.

32995888,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638810,1725019200,"ETH Whale Purchases PEPU, Playdoge and Their Rival Token Currently at $0.001777","In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, strategic investments by whales, those with massive holdings often signal potential surges in value. Recently, an ETH whale made headlines by acquiring a significant amount of Pepe Unchained (PEPU), Playdoge (PLAY), and their rising competitor, Mpeppe (MPEPE), currently priced at $0.001777. This move has caught the attention of the crypto community, as it could indicate the beginning of a major bull run for these tokens. The Power of PEPU: A Game-Changer in the Meme Coin Market Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has been making waves in the meme coin sector, thanks to its innovative Layer-2 blockchain, aptly named “Pepe Chain.” This technology promises to outperform Ethereum by offering speeds up to 100 times faster and drastically reducing transaction fees. As a result, Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has attracted a significant following, driving its ICO close to the $11 million mark. What makes Pepe Unchained (PEPU) stand out is not just its technological edge but also its lucrative staking rewards, which offer an estimated 188% annual yield. With over 849 million Pepe Unchained (PEPU) tokens already locked up, the project has garnered credibility and a growing community, including notable mentions from influencers like ClayBro. As the ICO nears its completion, the potential for up to 100x returns post-DEX listing is becoming increasingly likely. For the ETH whale, Pepe Unchained (PEPU) represents more than just a meme coin; it is a strategic investment in a token that could redefine the boundaries of what meme coins can achieve. With the anticipated bull run on the horizon, Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is well-positioned to lead the charge, making it a must-watch for any serious investor. Playdoge (PLAY): The Nostalgic Play-to-Earn Phenomenon Playdoge (PLAY) has captured the hearts of investors and gamers alike by combining the nostalgia of Tamagotchi with the lucrative potential of Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming. In Playdoge, players raise virtual doges, adorable digital pets, and earn $PLAY tokens through activities like feeding and training. This unique blend of entertainment and cryptocurrency has already led to a successful presale, raising $6.5 million. Jacob Bury, a well-known crypto analyst, predicts that Playdoge (PLAY) could see a 10x rally upon its exchange launch. His optimism is based on the token’s strong market position on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), known for its low fees and high transaction speeds. The fact that Playdoge (PLAY) is launching at a time when the BSC network is experiencing a surge in meme coin interest only adds to its potential for explosive growth. For the ETH whale, Playdoge (PLAY) offers a compelling investment opportunity. The combination of a strong community, nostalgic appeal, and the potential for massive returns makes it an attractive addition to any portfolio. As Playdoge (PLAY) prepares for its DEX listing, the final presale hours offer a last chance for investors to get in at the ground level before the token potentially skyrockets. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Underdog with 100x Potential While Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Playdoge (PLAY) are already generating significant buzz, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is the dark horse in this trio of investments. Currently priced at $0.001777, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioning itself as a serious contender in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and meme coin spaces. With its innovative approach to decentralized gambling, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an enticing blend of entertainment and financial reward. The recent investment by the ETH whale into Mpeppe (MPEPE) suggests that this token could be on the brink of a major breakout. As more investors begin to recognize its potential, the demand for Mpeppe (MPEPE) could surge, driving its value upward and potentially leading to the coveted 100x returns. The Perfect Trifecta: PEPU, Playdoge (PLAY), and Mpeppe (MPEPE) The ETH whale’s strategic investment in Pepe Unchained (PEPU), Playdoge (PLAY), and Mpeppe (MPEPE) highlights the potential of these tokens to deliver life-changing profits. Each token brings something unique to the table: Pepe Unchained (PEPU) with its groundbreaking Layer-2 technology, Playdoge (PLAY) with its nostalgic P2E gaming, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) with its innovative approach to decentralized gambling. As the broader market prepares for a potential bull run, these tokens are well-positioned to lead the charge. For investors looking to capitalize on the next wave of meme coin success, Pepe Unchained (PEPU), Playdoge (PLAY), and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer a compelling case for inclusion in any diversified portfolio. With the right timing and strategy, the rewards could be extraordinary.

The Fed's anticipated rate cuts could benefit Bitcoin, but a stronger US dollar and historical seasonal weakness in August and September pose risks. BITO offers exposure to Bitcoin futures, not directly to Bitcoin, and has returned 35.3% year-to-date compared to spot Bitcoin's 43.3% gain. Despite current bearish trends, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains constructive, with potential for gains in the October-December period. The Fed's long-awaited rate-cutting cycle is nearly upon us. September 18 is the date to mark on your calendar - that's when the first quarter-point ease is likely to come. There's even about a 1-in-3 chance of a large half-percentage point cut - perhaps depending on how next Friday's payrolls report verifies and what happens with August CPI to be published later in September. Lower rates, all else equal, should bode well for Bitcoin, but there are other macro and seasonal headwinds. I have a hold rating on the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) looking out the next two months, but am bullish longer-term. This is technically a downgrade since I was bullish on the product in Q4 last year. Price action was strong from October 2023 to this past March, leading up to and through the SEC's approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs back in January. BITO is down by about 20% since peaking back in March, though. Rate Cuts Priced In By Month CME FedWatch Tool, Author According to the issuer , BITO offers a way to gain exposure to Bitcoin-linked returns with the liquidity and transparency of an ETF. It aims to produce returns that correspond to Bitcoin. Importantly for prospective investors, BITO invests in Bitcoin futures and does not invest directly in Bitcoin. There is no guarantee that returns will correspond to Bitcoin. The ETF is the world's largest and first US Bitcoin-linked ETF and has tracked the performance of spot Bitcoin since its inception. Despite a plethora of spot Bitcoin ETFs now with more than seven months of trading history, BITO remains a moderate-sized fund with more than $1.8 billion in assets under management, up from $1.0 billion when I last reviewed the product. Its annual expense ratio is high at 0.95%, significantly above the level of the spot Bitcoin funds, while its stated yield is lofty at 47.8% as of August 28, 2024. The high payout rate is likely due to the ETF having held gains for many years, and there are requirements that distributions be made to shareholders. Share-price momentum has been weak since the tail end of the first quarter, and I'll detail price action in Bitcoin itself later in the article. Risk metrics are likewise weak given high annual volatility levels, but BITO remains a liquid ETP with more than eight million shares traded daily over the past 90 days on average and a median 30-day bid/ask spread of five basis points, per ProShares. A macro factor that could weigh on Bitcoin over the coming months is a higher US dollar. The US Dollar Index ( DXY ) recently tested the 100 level, the lowest since July 2023. The greenback has historically risen from September through November, however, and if that transpires once more in 2024, then BITO would likely be at risk. The Dollar's Snapback Likely Bearish for BITO TradingView Bitcoin itself hasn't offered much in the way of diversification. The world's largest cryptocurrency has moved in lockstep with the Nasdaq 100 for much of the past four years, and there was extreme volatility earlier this month during the yen-carry-trade unwind. Crypto investors, like me, would like to see Bitcoin buck the same trend as equities. Of course, with stocks near highs, one could make the case that so long as equities' uptrend persists, then that should generally bode well for BITO. Bitcoin Not Offering Much Diversification Benefit Bloomberg But Bitcoin is still in a material drawdown off its early 2024 peak near $73,000. The current pullback is low by historical standards, though, and we shouldn't discount the risk that Bitcoin is in the early inning of a multi-year bear market. Bitcoin: Historical Drawdowns Often Exceed 70% Koyfin Charts Focusing on the near term, August and September are historically poor months for Bitcoin. September has only been up in three of the past 10 years, with an average loss of 6%. The good news is that the October through December period is the best of the year, with massive gains having taken place over the past decade. Bitcoin: Bearish August-September Trends StockCharts.com It's key that prospective investors recognize that BITO holds Bitcoin futures. So far this year, BITO has returned 35.3% compared with spot Bitcoin's 43.3% gain. BITO: Holdings & Dividend Information Seeking Alpha The Technical Take With mixed macro risks, Bitcoin itself remains in a consolidation phase in my view. I don't see signs that a broad bear market is in the works. I make that assertion due to a series of lower highs and lower lows, suggesting that a broad bull flag pattern is in play. Notice in the chart below that support is apparent near the $50,000 level while the all-time high range of $69,000 to $73,800 is resistance. I don't like that Bitcoin has traded below its flattening long-term 200-day moving average and that a bearish death cross pattern transpired a few weeks ago. But take a look at the RSI momentum gauge at the top of the graph. It ranges in a neutral zone between 30 and 70, never spending much time in technical overbought or oversold conditions. I am concerned that the rally above the late-2021 previous all-time high could be a bearish false breakout, and I'd like to see Bitcoin rally to new highs, and perhaps that happens in the fourth quarter. Overall, there are mixed indicators on the chart, further cementing a hold rating. Bitcoin: Long-Term Bull Flag, Neutral Near-Term RSI StockCharts.com The Bottom Line I have a hold rating on BITO.

Injective Announces Release Of Web-Based IDE: Remix Web In a recent X post, Injective announced the release of the Remix Web IDE, an IDE that is entirely web-based providing developers the flexibility needed to develop powerful on-chain applications. To access the tool, simply visit the website and start building. 1/3 Exciting news! 🎉 Announcing the launch of the Remix Web IDE plugin for Injective. This web-based IDE is a gamechanger for the ecosystem, enabling developers to write, test, and deploy smart contracts right from their browser.https://t.co/t7NWnhtelc — Injective 🥷 (@injective) August 26, 2024 This revolutionary take on development lowers the bar in building within the Injective ecosystem and provides an example for other networks to follow. According to the blog, the web plugin also has code templates, providing newbies on the platform to create and deploy applications and smart contracts seamlessly. According to Shayan, the Developer Relations Manager at Injective Labs, one of the biggest struggles of developers is properly installing software dedicated to coding. As a developer, one of the most frustrating things is having to properly download software before being able to even write a single line of code. That’s why the new Remix IDE plugin is such a huge breakthrough. No more headaches dealing with making sure you have the latest… https://t.co/Xzb05mX7hb — Shayan (@0xShayan) August 27, 2024 “That’s why the new Remix IDE plugin is such a huge breakthrough. No more headaches dealing with making sure you have the latest versions of Rust or Go installed, whether you’ve selected the ARM or x86 binaries, etc,” said Shayan in his recent X post. The flexibility afforded by this recent addition to the platform means a new era of development for Injective with both new and experienced developers building on-chain apps and smart contracts on the platform. Helios-Injective Collabathon To Set New Heights On Web3 Finance Another development that piqued the interest of both investors and developers is Injective’s partnership with Helios, a Staking-as-a-Service provider, that is already a part of the former’s network as a validator. According to Helios’s blog post, the “Collabathon” will feature seasoned developers on both sides with a single goal of solving cross-chain identity verification, a challenge which, according to Helios, “will empower projects to confirm singular wallet ownership across multiple chains, enhancing interoperability and user experience.” The 10-day Collabathon will occur next week, September 2nd. Related Reading: XRP Gains Ground: 20% Of Institutional Investors Embrace The Crypto INJ Revisits $18.02 For Upside Potential As of this writing, INJ’s trajectory puts it just below $18.02. This revisit of a crucial price ceiling might trigger a rally soon. However, this possibility is hinged on the market’s uncertain movement, which currently screams hawkish. With this in mind, INJ does have the potential to regain ground in the medium term given that the market flips bullish in the same timeframe. The token’s relative strength index indicates low volatility in the market as both bulls and bears gather momentum for a breakthrough. In the long term, INJ bulls can target $23.37 to regain lost momentum. However, investors and traders should still exercise caution as the broader market may swing downward depending on the overall sentiment.

Companies keen to incorporate stablecoin payments face challenges of accessing on-ramps and off-ramps and facilitating transfers across different tokens and blockchains.  Crypto startup Bridge, which wants to build a global stablecoin-based payments networks, recently raised $40 million in fresh funding, taking the total raised to $58 million, Fortune reported Friday.  The startup, which was founded by Square and Coinbase alumni Zach Abrams and Sean Yu, aims to ""enable companies to use a stablecoin rail without thinking about it,"" Abrams said in an interview, according to the report.  Stablecoins are crypto tokens pegged to the value of a traditional financial asset such as a fiat currency, usually the U.S. dollar. Building stablecoin provision into a business allows companies to dip a toe into the crypto economy without dealing with the volatility that can afflict bitcoin {{BTC}} and other tokens. However, they then face the challenge of linking to traditional financial systems and facilitating transfers across different tokens and blockchains.  Bridge, whose customers include SpaceX and Coinbase, aspires to become a Web3 version of payments processor Stripe, operating as a global payments system into which other developers can integrate seamlessly. Earlier this year, Stripe itself said it planned to add crypto payments through Circle's USDC stablecoin.  Bridge did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for further comment.

32993086,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638754,1725010214,Crypto Liquidation Data Rigged By Exchanges? Researcher Unveils The Truth,"Vetle Lunde, a senior analyst at K33 Research, has issued a stark warning regarding the practices of prominent crypto exchanges concerning the authenticity of liquidation data. In a post on X, Lunde outlines how exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, and OKX have systematically modified their data reporting processes in a way that he claims significantly distorts the true scale of market liquidations. Why Crypto Liquidation Data Is Bogus The core of Lunde’s argument revolves around changes implemented by these exchanges around mid-2021. For example, both Binance and Bybit adjusted their liquidation WebSocket API to report only one liquidation per second, ostensibly to “provide a ‘fair trading environment’” and “optimize user data stream,” respectively. Similarly, OKX has implemented a cap, restricting the reporting to one order per second per contract. Lunde explains that this modification in the data stream profoundly impacts the market’s transparency, leading to a scenario where liquidation data, a critical metric used to assess market health and trader behavior, is “wildly underreported.” According to Lunde, this has been the case for the past three years, which has implications not only for traders but also for the broader financial analysis of the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Must Do This Now’, Says Crypto Analyst Historically, liquidation data has served as a barometer for the market’s leverage levels and has been instrumental in understanding how traders react to sudden price movements and volatility. Accurate liquidation data helps in gauging the market’s risk appetite and in assessing whether a market downturn has effectively purged excessive speculative leverage positions. With this data now being underreported, Lunde suggests that traders and analysts are flying blind. Lunde speculates on the motives behind these changes, suggesting that they may be driven by a desire to control the narrative around market stability and trader success. He points out that during the first half of 2021, high-profile liquidations were frequent fodder for media and social media discourse, often painting a picture of high risk and volatility in the crypto markets. By limiting the visibility of such events, exchanges might be trying to cultivate a more stable and trader-friendly image to attract and retain users. “I am guessing it’s a PR choice. In H1 2021, liquidation gore was Twitter, media, and everyone’s bread and butter. Constantly figuring at the top of liquidation leaderboards is not aligning with a strategy of attracting as many as possible to trade as much volume as possible,” Lunde remarks. Related Reading: Crypto Crash: $320 Million Wiped Out As Bitcoin And Ethereum Nosedive Further complicating matters, Lunde hints at the possibility that exchanges might be withholding liquidation data to maintain a competitive edge. “Some exchanges even have interests in investment firms that may trade on information that the rest of the market does not have,” the researcher speculates. Despite these significant challenges in accessing reliable data, Lunde discusses alternative methods to estimate current liquidation volumes, such as analyzing shifts in open interest or leveraging historical data to extrapolate current trends. However, he acknowledges that these methods have their shortcomings. They often fail to accurately reflect the changes in market participant behavior over the years or might overemphasize unusual market events that are not indicative of broader trends. Concluding his post, Lunde expresses a deep skepticism about the utility of the currently available liquidation data. He calls for a return to the levels of transparency seen in the past, though he pessimistically notes that such a change is unlikely given current trends. “For now, liquidation data is mostly erroneous entertainment and not actionable. I’d welcome a return to past transparency, but I guess we’ve already crossed the Rubicon,” Lunde concludes. At press time, BTC traded at $59,540.

42417317,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTY5Kn,1725004014,"Bitcoin Drops Under $59K as BTC Demand Wanes, BlackRock’s IBIT Logs Outflows for the Second Time","Bitcoin experienced a decline, falling below $59,000 with a weekly loss of over 3.5%, amidst signs of reduced demand and net outflows from major ETFs, such as BlackRock's IBIT.  However, data shows an uptick in U.S. retail investor interest, evidenced by a higher bitcoin price premium on Coinbase and increased inflows from international exchanges to Coinbase.  Traders anticipate increased volatility post-Labor Day, influenced by upcoming economic reports and political developments.  Continual profit-taking after last week’s rally saw bitcoin {{BTC}} continue a week-long slide to under $59,000 early Friday, with major exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recording net outflows amid signs of waning demand.  BTC lost just over 1% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows, bringing weekly losses to over 3.5% and on track to end August at an 8% haircut (with one day to go). Overall bitcoin demand growth remains low and has even turned negative in the last few weeks, as previously reported.  Read more: Bitcoin Slips Back to $58K in Continued Desultory Action, but Next Week Could Offer Upside Excitement  U.S.-listed BTC ETFs recorded $71 million in net outflows on Thursday for the third consecutive day, SoSoValue data shows, in a sign of professional funds leaving the market.  The biggest losers on Thursday were Fidelity’s FBTC at $31 million and Grayscale’s GBTC at $22 million. However, a shock move for traders came as BlackRock’s IBIT - the world’s largest bitcoin fund by assets under management - recorded outflows of $13 million for the second time ever.  As such, exchange data shows a bump in demand from U.S. retail investors as the bitcoin price premium on the Coinbase exchange has increased to its highest level since July, on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant shared in a Thursday report.  Additionally, bitcoin is flowing again from exchanges outside the U.S. to Coinbase, a signal of higher demand from US investors and a condition historically correlated with higher prices.  Meanwhile, traders expect market volatility to pick up in the coming weeks. BTC has largely traded sideways in the past week despite favorable rate cut signals and endorsements from Republican candidate Donald Trump – which has impacted sentiment for the broader crypto market.  “Crypto had an uneventful week as BTC and ETH hovered around +/- 1.5% compared to last week's levels. ETF inflows remain subdued,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA, said in a weekly note to clients.  “We expect market action to pick up after US Labour Day and into next week's NFP to kickstart a busy Fall season, and political headlines to start gaining importance, particularly with the latest Harris/Walz announced plans to raise taxes aggressively.”  It’s a view shared by traders at Singapore-based QCP Capital, who said in a Telegram broadcast that they expect price action to remain choppy even as market volatility may continue.  “Risk reversals until Oct are still skewed towards puts in both BTC and ETH, indicating that the market remains cautious about the downside,” QCP said. “In the lead-up to next week’s non-farm payroll report, we expect market volatility to continue its downtrend as the market positions itself for potential rate cuts by the Fed.”  Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has confirmed a pivot to lower borrowing costs next month, as previously reported. Such steps have historically buoyed bullish sentiment among traders as cheap access to money spurts growth in riskier sectors.  “With the absence of any catalysts in the near term, we anticipate prices to continue chopping within the range as we move into September,” QCP added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/30/bitcoin-drops-under-59k-as-btc-demand-wanes-blackrocks-ibit-logs-outflows-for-the-second-time,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/151cd4feb643ef7a453161bc1840eb87e68375c2-2753x1549.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32989834,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638702,1725003021,"Bitcoin ‘Must Do This Now’, Says Crypto Analyst","In a breakdown of Bitcoin’s current market dynamics, prominent crypto analyst Dan Gambardello, in his latest video titled “Bitcoin Must Do This Now,” addressed his 368,000 followers on YouTube regarding the critical resistance levels Bitcoin is currently testing. Gambardello emphasized the importance of these levels for both short-term price movements and broader market indicators. Why Bitcoin Must Turn Bullish Now Gambardello’s analysis begins with an emphasis on the significance of the short-term holder cost basis, which currently stands at $63,600. He highlighted this metric as a pivotal momentum indicator, underscoring its role in determining the immediate bearish or bullish nature of the market. “Bitcoin is just $2,000 away from the short-term holder cost basis now at $63,600.” According to Gambardello, this is a critical momentum indicator investors need to watch. Gambardello also maps out the various resistance zones that Bitcoin needs to conquer to signal an optimistic market turnaround. He points out that Bitcoin is operating just above the 20-day moving average on the daily chart at the time of his analysis. However, the proximity of the closing time for the daily candle left the situation highly tentative. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages were also discussed as significant barriers that needed to be breached to confirm a bullish trend. Related Reading: Bullish Bitcoin News? US Federal Reserve Set To Implement Three Rate Cuts This Year In addition to these moving averages, the Fibonacci retracement levels form another cornerstone of his technical scrutiny. He elaborates on the potential for Bitcoin to encounter a lower high resistance area, which could lead to either a price consolidation or a downward correction if these levels failed to be surpassed. Gambardello also ventures into macroeconomic territory. He indicates that the prevalence of recession-related fears could hint at broader economic shifts that might impact the broader crypto market. “The algorithms on X are bombarding me with recession posts, recession data, recession charts. There’s a probable increase because there are actually a lot of indicators that the market is going to crash,” he explained. Moreover, the crypto analyst is heavily focusing on the 20-week moving average, a level he describes as a historically significant marker in distinguishing between bull and bear markets. The failure to sustain levels above this moving average, he points out, often precedes bearish trends, while support at or above this line could herald bullish conditions. “Failing to get above the 20-week moving average is what Bitcoin does when it’s entering bear markets,” he observes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forecast: Expert Reveals 4 Reasons To Be Bullish On Q4 From a momentum perspective, the analyst drew attention to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators. Both tools, he mentions, currently suggest that Bitcoin is well-positioned for potential upward movement, given the consolidation patterns and cooling periods observed recently. However, Bitcoin must move upwards now. “Bitcoin really took off last cycle when the RSI was around 54 if you go back two cycles, Bitcoin was consistently around 53, 50 close to 54 before taking off each time […] consolidation in the RSI, then boom. So we’re from a momentum perspective right where it needs to be. But the move that we need is up now,” the crypto analyst warns. Another warning sign could be a lasting fall below the 20-week moving average. “We need to see Bitcoin above that 20 week moving average. […] If we see resistance […] we have to anticipate that we could go in the lower $50,000s very fast. It could happen very fast,” Gambardello says, marking it as an essential condition for the commencement of a sustained bullish phase. From a bullish perspective, Gambardello is waiting for a breakout above $63,700. “We’re looking for bullish confirmations to break this entire range and really currently it’s like $63,000 or up to around 63,700 – that’s the range, it’s not even a big range for Bitcoin to make the move but that’s what we’re watching,” he remarks. Overall, it’s a question of $50,000 or $70,000 as Gambardello puts it on X: “A break above could trigger a mini run towards $70k. Failure could mean new lows around $50k.” At press time, BTC traded at $ Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-must-do-this-now-crypto-analyst/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

In an interview with Cointelegraph, Handika introduced the concept of forward hashrate contracts. This financial instrument allows miners to sell their future hashrate in exchange for fiat-denominated loans from creditors, potentially sustaining operations and funding growth. “It means that you can use your debt money to buy more mining machines and hedge your price volatility risk because the risk of Bitcoin’s price",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-miner-calls-for-forward-hashrate-contracts-following-btc-halving/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
42417303,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTY5AT,1725002450,Russia Is About to Try Using Crypto to Get Around Sanctions,"Russia will start its trial of cross-border payments using crypto next week.  Recent statements from senior Russian leaders suggest the law’s purpose is to use crypto to counter sanctions.  The law hands power to Russia’s central bank to oversee an “experimental” regime.  Russia will begin trialing cross-border crypto payments next week in an effort to circumvent international sanctions – but this effort may not work, several policy and legal experts told CoinDesk.  Legislation passed at the end of July and swiftly signed into law by President Vladimir Putin does not lift an existing ban on using cryptocurrencies as legal tender for regular payments within Russia, but instead allows cross-border payments with crypto.  How the law will allow such payments remains unclear because the legislation doesn’t specify rules for such transactions. Instead it hands power to Russia’s central bank to oversee an “experimental” regime, experts said.  Russia's economy has been hit hard by a suite of sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other nations following its invasion of Ukraine.  Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in Feb. 2022, it’s faced 16,500 sanctions from the U.S., U.K., European Union, Australia, Canada and Japan.  ""The passing of these bills by the Russian government signals a continuation of Russia’s evolving strategy to circumvent Western sanctions,"" blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis’ director of investigations, Valerie Kennedy, told CoinDesk.  The EU said about half of Russia’s total foreign currency reserves, worth 300 billion euros ($332 billion), including 70% of the assets of the Russian banking system, were frozen. Select Russian banks were disconnected by the interbank messaging system, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT).  ""It has been difficult for Russia to avoid the U.S. dollar and euro via the SWIFT system, which has created increasing risk of secondary sanctions,"" she added. Secondary sanctions are penalties designed to prevent any third party from trading with a sanctioned nation.  What the law says  Some details have emerged in the days leading up to the Sept. 1 implementation of the law.  CoinDesk viewed a copy of the law using google translate. It said “during the circulation of digital currency in the Russian federation … special regulation may be established … by the experimental legal regime program.” That regime is still in the works. Before finalizing it, the central bank will consider proposals and suggestions from domestic stakeholders.  “Some players, including us, have already come with our own proposals,” said Anti Danilevski, founder and CEO of Kick Ecosystem, a one stop shop for crypto, who has been closely engaging with regulators. “The central bank will decide if it fits with their view. They are moving very fast, so it won't take much time.”  Bloomberg reported that Russia is planning to use the National Payment Card System, for swapping between rubles and cryptocurrencies when testing payments. The system was chosen because it already features infrastructure for functions like interbank settlement and is fully regulated by the central bank. If the trials are successful, Russia may allow the Moscow Exchange and the St. Petersburg Currency Exchange to set up crypto platforms next year, the report added.  Ivan Chuprunov, an associate professor at the Research Centre of Private Law in Moscow, said the regime’s “exact parameters are not clear” because none have been published yet but the “central bank will likely publish some guidance in the coming weeks.”  The law also appears to let the central bank change how it oversees these trials at any time.  The legislation said that the provisions may “exclude or change” parts of the Federal Law in relation to transactions with “digital currency made in the implementation of foreign trade activities through an authorized organization.”  The regime is “more a flexible one” because it’s “just the central bank who will be approving it,” said Chuprunov. “Whether they will have just one exchange, what currencies would be traded, how participants would get trading access, is still a big unknown.”  Nor does the law clearly specify what rules now apply to crypto entities or businesses wanting to deal in crypto, because the central bank will determine which companies will participate in the experiment.  While the law doesn’t specify what its exact purpose is, recent statements from senior Russian leaders pointed toward using crypto to counter sanctions.  On July 17, 2024, in an economic affairs meeting, Putin said Russia should not “miss the moment” and should promptly set up a “legal framework” for crypto, which is “increasingly used in the world as a means of payment in international settlements.”  Then, one of the authors of the bill said Russia views cryptocurrencies “primarily as a tool for circumventing sanctions,” followed by its central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina saying that’s why we “softened our stance” on crypto at an event in Moscow recently.  Centralized implementation uncertainty  Uncertainty remains around how Russia will use this new law to exert more control and overcome sanctions.  The experimental regime is a global first of its kind because it hands carte blanche control to the central bank to make any rules anytime and select any company it chooses to participate in the test.  “Authorizing the Bank of Russia to create an electronic platform for digital currency transactions and monitor activities centralizes control,” said Jim Mignano, an assistant policy researcher at research organization RAND.  Because the law allows such dynamic rule-making, it’s difficult to predict how geopolitics or new sanctions will make Russia’s government and central bank change the law every now and then.  “I've been practicing Russian law for over 18 years. I cannot remember the word 'experimental' in a draft law,” said Svetlana London, managing partner at CIS London, a law firm specializing in advising clients about cross-border transactions related to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which includes Russia. “It's quite difficult to decipher, just based on the label, how exactly it will work.”  Danilevski said the law gives the Central Bank of Russia the power to release an experimental legal regime (ELR) but that in its current form the ELR “won’t work effectively” and needs “significant refinement” for “practical implementation.”  And then comes the question of whether Russia will even reveal how it chooses to implement the law. Sitting alongside Governor Nabiullina at that Moscow event last month, Andrei Kostin, head of Russia’s second largest lender, VTB, proposed that the implementation of such laws should be made a ""state secret"" because right now “somewhere at the U.S. embassy” someone is noting down every statement we make, to allow the West to react “very” quickly.  West will respond in “new ways”  Mignano told CoinDesk that the successful bypassing of sanctions by Russia could “prompt more aggressive enforcement measures or new forms of sanctions.”  One of those growing threats is that of secondary sanctions.  Last month after the bill passed, Governor Nabiullina told Reuters that ""The risks of secondary sanctions have grown. They make payments for imports difficult, and that concerns a wide range of goods.”  ""While crypto assets may live and move outside the traditional financial system, the activity will be traceable and trackable allowing Western governments to follow and investigate transactions in new and innovative ways,"" Isabella Chase, Senior Policy Advisor of Europe Middle East and Asia at blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs said.  Foreign partners and liquidity  Despite the law's intent, experts questioned whether foreign partners will engage through crypto.  Kennedy also said crypto markets don’t have the liquidity to support such evasion “en masse” without “either crashing the prices of crypto assets or drawing the attention of blockchain observers” suggesting that such evasion “will look like other forms of money laundering” – small amounts of crypto “gradually moved to cashout points.”  Mignano said this problem might require Russia to “do more work.” It may need to offer “economic or political incentives to counterparties” to participate in crypto-based transactions, he said.

The latest report from research firm Messari highlights Hedera’s progress across key financial indicators. Hedera Q2 Momentum One of the pivotal highlights of Hedera’s Q2 was the advancement in crucial financial metrics. Despite a 29% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) dip in circulating market cap to $2.7 billion, HBAR managed to climb six spots from 36 to 30 among all tokens, surpassing similarly priced cryptocurrencies. Per the report, revenue also became a beacon of success for Hedera during Q2, with the network witnessing a 26% uptick in USD revenue, reaching $1.4 million. Moreover, revenue in HBAR surged by 19% quarter-over-quarter to 14.6 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forecast: Expert Reveals 4 Reasons To Be Bullish On Q4 The pace of HBAR issuance and circulation remained a focus, with 72% of the total 50 billion HBAR in circulation at the end of Q2. The quarterly distribution of HBAR indicated the release of an additional 1.5 billion HBAR in the upcoming quarter, with a significant allocation of 94% earmarked for ecosystem and open source development initiatives. While daily accounts created increased 31% sequentially to 11,100, daily active addresses declined 37% to 10,600, reflecting a mixed picture of growth and engagement within the network. Transaction activity rebounded in Q2, as average daily transactions increased 46% to 132.9 million, driven primarily by the Hedera Consensus service. Staking Surge And DeFi Fluctuations The report further highlighted Staking in the network, which emerged as a significant trend within the ecosystem, with 62.2% of the circulating supply staked, signaling a high level of engagement from entities like Swirlds and Swirlds Labs. However, the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape on Hedera witnessed fluctuations in Q2, with Total Value Locked (TVL) experiencing a decline in both USD and HBAR metrics. Still, Messari asserts that initiatives like the HBAR Foundation’s DeFi TVL growth program have injected vitality into the ecosystem, driving liquidity and awareness. Liquid staking on the other hand, saw a resurgence in Q2, with Stader’s TVL increasing by 41% in HBAR terms.

Lastly, Hedera’s decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes also saw a dip in the second quarter after a bullish first quarter, according to Messari, but it has remained strong year-over-year (YoY). At the time of writing, HBAR records a significant 22% drop in price over the past month, currently trading at $0.050 amid the general market uncertainty led by increased volatility of the largest cryptocurrencies on the market Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Additionally, CoinGecko data shows that the token has seen a notable decrease in trading volume over the past 48 hours, dropping by 35%. Most importantly, HBAR is still 91% below its all-time high of $0.056 reached in September 2021.

There is a key rising channel forming with support at $0.1595 on the hourly chart of the TRX/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to climb higher toward $0.1620 or even $0.1650. Tron Price Eyes Fresh Increase Recently, Bitcoin and Ethereum saw a fresh decline below $60,000 and $2,650 respectively. However, Tron price remained stable above the $0.1550 support. A low was formed near $0.1554 and the price started a decent upward move. There was a move above the $0.1585 resistance level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1688 swing high to the $0.1554 low. However, the bears seem to be active near the $0.1620 level. TRX price is now trading below $0.1620 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a key rising channel forming with support at $0.1595 on the hourly chart of the TRX/USD pair. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the $0.1610 level. The first major resistance is near $0.1620, above which the price could accelerate higher. The next resistance is near $0.1650 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1688 swing high to the $0.1554 low. A close above the $0.1650 resistance might send TRX further higher toward $0.1720. The next major resistance is near the $0.1740 level, above which the bulls are likely to aim for a larger increase toward $0.1850 in the near term. Are Dips Supported in TRX? If TRX price fails to clear the $0.1620 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1595 zone and the channel’s trend line. The first major support is near the $0.1575, below which it could test $0.1550. Any more losses might send Tron toward the $0.1520 support in the coming sessions.

32986376,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638644,1724994045,"Major Crypto Exchanges Tease Solana Liquid Staking Tokens, Will SOL Takeoff?","Three major crypto exchanges teased the launch of new Solana-based products. The trading platforms shared mysterious hints on their official X accounts, suggesting their entry to Solana’s Liquid Staking ecosystem. The news received a positive reaction from the crypto community, seemingly fueling a bullish sentiment among SOL investors. Related Reading: TON-Based Memecoin DOGS Becomes Top 100 Largest Gainer With 30% Jump Exchanges Hint At New Solana-Based Products On Thursday, crypto exchanges Binance, Bybit, and Bidget created a buzz among crypto investors after hinting at the launch of new Solana-based products. Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, was the first to announce the mysterious partnership with two X posts stating “BNSOL,” and “Coming soon.” The crypto community quickly speculated about the meaning of the post, wondering about the collaboration. Soon after, Bybit and Bitget posted similar messages. Bybit stated it was “welcoming a new baby to the family” named bbSOL, while Bitget teased that “something BG is coming #BGSOL.” Despite not having further details, the community concluded the exchanges will launch Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), based on Sanctum’s comments. The Solana-based Liquid Staking Protocol replied to the news, hinting at its involvement in the project. In a reply to Bybit’s post, the Liquid Staking protocol said it was “ready to help this bbSOL grow big and strong.” This suggests that the exchanges are entering the Solana Liquid Staking ecosystem. The BNSOL, BGSOL, and bbSOL LSTs would allow users to stake their tokens and receive rewards while continuing to participate in other DeFi projects. The tokens would offer investors flexibility, as they would have access to liquidity without unstaking their tokens. Major Boost For SOL Price Coming? Following the announcements, the crypto community expressed a positive sentiment towards SOL. Many shared their excitement about the products, calling them “bullish” for the Solana ecosystem. Meanwhile, others suggested that positive competition was brewing in Solana’s Liquid Staking sector. The bullish sentiment seemingly translated to CLOUD, Sanctum’s governance token. The Liquid Staking protocol’s token soared 56% following the announcement. CLOUD saw a massive surge from the $0.16 price range to the $0.25 mark before stabilizing above the $0.24 level. Similarly, some community members noted that the crypto exchanges appear to see significant potential in SOL’s performance. SOL quickly surged to the $147 range, a 4.2% increase from Wednesday’s lows. Despite the positive sentiment, the price retraced to the $145 support zone before unsuccessfully retesting the daily high a second time. Nonetheless, investors believe that the recently announced tokens could bring a significant inflow of liquidity as the crypto exchanges have a massive user base. Moreover, the TSLs could accelerate Solana’s Liquid staking sector’s expansion and boost its adoption by retail users. The fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had its price recovery halted by the most recent market shakeout. SOL’s price lost the $160 support zone and revisited the $140 level as Bitcoin slipped to $58,000 two days ago.

Despite the increase in total revenue, Bitdeer's most profitable segment continues to erode, as cloud hash revenue was down over 32% year over year. Bitdeer joins a crowded field of Bitcoin miners efforting AI services as an uncorrelated revenue segment to BTC production. The balance sheet isn't terrible, and the company just raised $145 million via senior notes, but potential investors should remain mindful of volatility from low-float, illiquid stock relative to peers. Nearly a full year has passed since I last covered Bitdeer Technologies ( BTDR ) for Seeking Alpha. It's a name that I've written about a few times and I've consistently rated it a 'hold' in each piece going back to April of last year. Bitdeer: Bucking The Sector Trend? Bitdeer Is a Top 3 Bitcoin Miner: Should It Be? Bitdeer: Too Early To Tell On This SPAC Merger Miner Data by YCharts BTDR shares have doubled or tripled over a period of just a few weeks, three distinctly different times going back the last 15 months. It's a volatile stock - we'll get into why in a later section. At one point, Bitdeer was the third largest publicly traded Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining company by market capitalization. It's currently ranked 10th: Bitcoin Miners By MC (Seeking Alpha) Given the company's decline in market cap rank against peers, it's perhaps unsurprising to see BTDR having the 2nd worst YTD performance and the worst 12 month performance among top 10 miners. In this update, we'll look at the company's second quarter earnings, AI pivot, July production, balance sheet position, and institutional holdings. Second Quarter Earnings In Q2-24, Bitdeer reported $99.2 million in total revenue. This was up 5.8% over Q2-23, but down by 17% sequentially. Interestingly, most of the company's individual business lines were down year over, with one notable exception; self-mining. Segment Q2-23 Q1-24 Q2-23 YoY QoQ Self-mining $21.6 $48.4 $41.6 92.9% -14.0% Cloud Hash Rate $18.0 $18.1 $12.2 -32.3% -32.6% General Hosting $27.8 $29.0 $20.6 -25.8% -29.0% Membership Hosting $23.9 $19.5 $22.1 -7.7% 13.3% Other $2.5 $4.5 $0.0 -100.0% -100.0% Total revenue $93.8 $119.5 $99.2 5.8% -17.0% Source: Bitdeer, Author's Calculations, dollars in millions Self-mining revenue surge nearly 93% year over year. According to Bitdeer, the drop in cloud hash revenue was due to poor margins for clients following the block reward halving in April. General hosting revenue declines were attributed to temporary rig shutdowns - again due to the halving. This would appear to indicate that hosting machines are battling efficiency issues with less BTC to mine per block. Segment Q2-24 Rev EH/s Rev per EH/s Self-mining $41.6 7.3 $5.7 Cloud Hash Rate $12.2 1.2 $10.2 General/Member Hosting $20.6 13.8 $1.5 Source: Bitdeer, Author's Calculations, dollars in millions As I've pointed out in previous articles, the cloud hash segment is by far the company's most profitable line of business, judging by revenue per EH/s. Given the continued erosion of that revenue segment, I would expect that the company needs a drastically different Bitcoin price to entice new customers to attempt cloud mining once again if that segment is ever going to return to the revenue figures it from just a couple of years ago. Data by YCharts From a net income standpoint, Bitdeer reported a $17.7 million quarterly loss. This was the largest quarterly loss since Q2-23. $15.5 million of that loss was due to a ""fair value change for Tether warrants"" per Bitdeer . AI & July Production Stop me if you've heard this one before, but we have yet another Bitcoin miner that is entering the AI space. I'm making light of the situation, but there is theoretically an overlay between BTC mining and AI compute services. Although they require completely different chips, experience in datacenters and energy infrastructure are skills that are shared by both BTC miners and HPC builders. However, unlike the GPU-based mining that Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) previously allowed pre-merge, building out an AI solution as a Bitcoin miner requires H100s rather than ASICs. Nevertheless, Bitdeer recently announced its AI training platform that will utilize NVIDIA ( NVDA ) H100 GPUS as well as InfiniBand Networks. The company worked with TLM Group to consult Bitdeer regarding its datacenter strategy. In the July production update, Bitdeer noted 100% utilization of its NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD system and said it will expand AI operations carefully to avoid ""over investment."" BTC Production (Bitdeer, Author's Chart) From a BTC production standpoint, EH/s growth in the self-mining segment has been generally up, but slow for the last 8 months. At 7.5 EH/s in July 2024, Bitdeer's monthly EH/s is about double what it was in July 2023, but still under the peak from last November. We can see in this chart the clear impact of April's halving. EH/s is double what it was a year ago, yet BTC production is actually down. In my view, it's obvious, Bitdeer either needs a much higher BTC price to earn more dollars off less BTC production and to resuscitate its cloud hash rate business, or it needs its new AI initiative to be a big success. Balance Sheet Data by YCharts The good news is the company does have some time. As of the quarter ended June, Bitdeer has nearly $204 million in cash and $827.7 million in total assets against just $348 million in total liabilities. At about $41.5 million in combined intangibles and goodwill, Bitdeer's balance sheet isn't overly reliant on extrinsic value for the company's $905 million market capitalization. Of course, this could certainly change if the price of Bitcoin were to crash. The result of which would surely be a re-rating of the value of Bitdeer's mining equipment. That said, at 1.7x book and 1.8x sales, BTDR is on the ""cheaper"" end of the Bitcoin miner industry. As part of Bitdeer's datacenter growth strategy, the company is raising roughly $144.5 million from a convertible senior note offering at 8.5% that is due in 2029. 'Tutes' & The Low Float Data by YCharts Earlier in the article, I made note of the volatility in the name. In my view, this has been attributable to what has been a low float compared to BTC mining peers. BTDR CLSK HUT BITF CIFR Shares Outstanding 137.30M 248.12M 91.08M 451.98M 328.94M Float % 24.56% 97.42% 78.51% 78.18% 64.44% Insider Shares 83.00M 6.38M 10.42M 8.83M 57.63M Insider % 60.45% 2.57% 11.45% 1.95% 17.52% Institutional Shares 10.00M 107.64M 42.62M 100.74M 96.70M Institutional % 7.28% 43.38% 46.79% 22.29% 29.40% Source: Seeking Alpha At just 24.5% of shares outstanding, BTDR is a very low-float stock compared to other Bitcoin mining equities. And at 60% insider holdings, this is not what I'd call a liquid stock. The recent surge in shares outstanding will theoretically help alleviate that, but any potential investors who want to take a shot on BTDR stock would be wise to only us limit orders so they don't get beat up by slippage. Closing Thoughts The most profitable segment the company currently has continues to erode. September is a weak month for Bitcoin historically. And the Federal Reserve appears poised to begin cutting rates in September. As I detailed in a pervious article for Seeking Alpha, Bitcoin's performance following the beginning of rate cuts is not great. It wasn't until after the Fed stopped cutting that BTC begin its surge higher back in 2020. I don't actually hate the idea of BTDR as a possible swing trade, but I'm still going to rate BTDR a hold today as a long term investment.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4718062-bitdeer-another-buck-hunting-ai?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32984961.jpeg

32984453,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638572,1724988635,XRP Whales Are Depositing To Exchanges: Price To Drop Further?,"On-chain data shows the XRP whales have been making deposits to exchanges recently, something that could be bearish for the asset’s price. XRP Whales Have Made Several Large Moves In The Past Day According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, several large moves have been spotted on the XRP network during the past day. Related Reading: Polygon On-Chain Activity Lights Up: MATIC Reversal Incoming? All of these moves are of a scale that may be associated with the whales, who are humongous entities on the blockchain that control a non-negligible part of the circulating supply. Because of their large holdings, these investors can naturally carry some influence on the market, making their moves worth following. It’s usually hard to say what a whale intended to achieve with a transaction, however, as on-chain info carries a layer of privacy. Nonetheless, depending on the type of addresses that are involved in the transfer, hints can sometimes be gathered. There have been three whale transfers with such identifying addresses in the last 24 hours. Below are the details for the earliest of them. As is visible above, this transfer involved the movement of 26.8 million XRP, worth around $15.3 million at the time that the move was executed. The sending address for the transaction was an unknown wallet, meaning that it wasn’t associated with any known centralized platform. The receiver, on the other hand, was connected to one such platform: the cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp. Transfers like this, which go from self-custodial wallets to an exchange, are known as exchange inflows. Generally, investors deposit their coins to these platforms to make use of one of the services that they provide, which can include selling. As such, exchange inflows, especially of a large scale, can prove to be bearish for XRP. The other two exchange-related whale transactions from the past day were similar to this one, in the fact that they were also exchange inflows. In the older of the two, the whale moved 19.4 million tokens ($11 million) to the Bitso exchange. Interestingly, as the below details show, the sending address of this transfer is an exact match for the one from the Bitstamp inflow. This could suggest that the same whale may have been responsible for both of the deposits. The third exchange inflow from the last 24 hours was towards Binance, but this one had a unique sending address, so it may not be related to these other ones. This one also happens to be the largest deposit of the three, as it saw 60 million XRP ($34.2 million) move into the wallets affiliated with the platform. Naturally, it’s not certain if these whales have made the inflows for selling, but in the scenario that it’s true, the asset’s price could take a hit from them. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plummets To $59,000, On-Chain Data Reveals Why There was also a fourth whale transaction on the network in this window, but the 92.1 million XRP ($52.1 million) move was made between two unknown wallets, so it’s impossible to comment on its purpose.

ETH is now struggling to gain pace for a move above the $2,600 resistance zone. Ethereum started a recovery wave above $2,500 and $2,550. The price is trading below $2,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2,550 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must stay above $2,485 to start another increase in the near term. Ethereum Price Attempts Recovery Ethereum price remained stable above $2,400 and attempted a recovery wave like Bitcoin. The price was able to rise above the $2,480 and $2,500 resistance levels. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,792 swing high to the $2,395 low. The price even surpassed the $2,550 resistance. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2,550 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. However, the bears were active near the $2,600 resistance. They protected the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,792 swing high to the $2,395 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,580 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,550 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The first major resistance is near the $2,600 level. A close above the $2,600 level might send Ether toward the $2,660 resistance. The next key resistance is near $2,720. An upside break above the $2,720 resistance might send the price higher toward the $2,820 resistance zone in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,600 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near $2,500. The first major support sits near the $2,485 zone. A clear move below the $2,485 support might push the price toward $2,420 where the bulls could emerge. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,320 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,250. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

This bounce back in price has sparked renewed interest among the crypto community, with many closely watching for the next key moves in the market. Particularly, this latest price action has led to various analyses, focusing on whether the asset can maintain its momentum and break through critical resistance levels that have previously hindered its progress. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Will Top Out By 2025, But At What Price Target? The Path Forward: Key Levels To Watch One prominent voice in the crypto community, Captain Faibik, shared his insights earlier today, emphasizing the importance of the $69,000 to $70,000 resistance zone. According to Faibik, Bitcoin has been consolidating within a ‘Descending Broadening Wedge’ for the past six months. This pattern is often seen as a precursor to a significant breakout, should the right conditions be met. Faibik pointed out that breaking through the $69,000 to $70,000 resistance level is crucial for the bulls, as previous attempts have failed to clear this barrier. However, he remains optimistic, suggesting that this time might be different due to the weakening of the resistance. If Bitcoin can successfully break out of the Descending Broadening Wedge to the upside, Faibik believes that the top crypto could easily reach the $100,000 mark by the fourth quarter of this year. However, despite this optimism, Faibik advises: For now, leverage trading might not be ideal. If you’re a Bitcoin holder, it’s time to sit back and Relax, as the Bitcoin bull run is very close. Bitcoin Gradual Recovery At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $60,112, reflecting a 4.1% increase over the past 24 hours. This marks a gradual recovery from the dip below $59,000 seen earlier this week. Despite this positive movement, Bitcoin remains down 1.8% over the past week, indicating that the market is still in a state of bearishness. Another analyst, Crypto Feras, also weighed in on Bitcoin’s current price action, highlighting the importance of the $61,000 to $62,000 zone. According to Crypto Fears, this region was a critical support level that needed to hold to maintain bullish momentum. However, as Bitcoin failed to hold this level, the market experienced a further decline. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s August Candle Hints at Major Reversal—Are Bulls About to Take Over? The analyst noted that while Bitcoin is currently bouncing back, reclaiming the $61,000 to $62,000 zone and the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is crucial for a sustained recovery. Failure to do so could result in another leg down, making the $61,500 zone a key area to watch in the coming days.

32980601,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638618,1724977819,Bullish Bitcoin News? US Federal Reserve Set To Implement Three Rate Cuts This Year,"As global economic uncertainty looms, Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced increased volatility and is struggling to maintain its footing above critical resistance levels lost over the past month. The largest cryptocurrency on the market remains in a precarious position, but emerging signs could bode well for the BTC price and the broader crypto ecosystem. Fed’s Rate Cuts Signal Hope For Bitcoin Price Recovery One promising development is the possibility of further interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) later this year. According to market expert Walter Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs Asset Management anticipates that the Fed will implement a series of three consecutive 25-basis point rate cuts in September, November, and December. Gurpreet Garewal, a macro strategist at Goldman Sachs, noted in a recent report that a weak labor market, as indicated in the upcoming August jobs report, could even prompt the Fed to adopt a more aggressive approach, potentially starting with a 50-basis point cut. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forecast: Expert Reveals 4 Reasons To Be Bullish On Q4 Currently, money markets are pricing in a total of 100 basis points of rate cuts for the year, as reported by Refinitiv. This outlook aligns with comments made by Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week, who adopted a dovish tone, suggesting the central bank is open to further rate reductions to address signs of cooling in the labor market. Such a stance is generally seen as positive for risk assets, including Bitcoin. Anticipation of the rate cut had an immediate impact on the Bitcoin price, which surged to a one-month high of $65,000 late last week. However, continued volatility caused the BTC price to fall back to $57,900 on Wednesday, but it has since recovered and is trading above $60,000. Analyst Warns Of Potential Price Corrections Ahead Despite Bitcoin’s recent rebound above $60,200 on Friday, analysts are warning investors to keep an eye out for further price declines as the largest cryptocurrency still shows no signs of strong catalysts. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified a sell signal on the Bitcoin hourly chart using the TD Sequential indicator, suggesting that another price correction could be on the horizon. Related Reading: The Entire Crypto Bull Run Hinges On These Factors: Analyst With this in mind, the $58,000 level has already proven to be a major support level for the cryptocurrency this week. If breached, the other major support level in the near term would be the $57,200 level, as seen on the daily BTC/USDT chart below. However, should this scenario play out, the token’s overall macro range would remain intact as this has been part of BTC’s price consolidation between $57,000 and $70,000 for the past six months following the correction from all-time highs of $73,7000.
