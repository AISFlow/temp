42400695,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKQXY,1511611224,Are Tokens Like Gold? Attorneys Ask Tough Questions on ICOs,"It's unusual for panels to get heated, but that's just what happened during a discussion on securities law and the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) on Tuesday.  Called ""Structuring Legally Compliant Token Sales,"" the panel took place at the Cardozo School of Law, at Yeshiva University in Manhattan. There, much of the conversation centered on the SAFT white paper introduced by Cooley LLP attorney Marco Santori and Protocol Labs, as well as critiques leveled yesterday at that model by the Cardozo Blockchain Project.  Stepping back, Santori was there explain to the audience how the SAFT tries to break a token sale into two parts, separating the fundraising of a project from the code that will eventually help power the software project for which it has been designed.  In the first part, an investor gets a contract for coins once a protocol is launched and ready for use.  The people who pre-order these tokens ""take on enterprise risk,"" Santori said. That part is definitely a security, he granted.  Continuing, Santori compared this part to how bankers used to finance miners to dig gold. When the gold came back, no one thought that the gold was a security, he reasoned. In this way, he said that, with the SAFT, the entrepreneur doesn't even have to sell what he made to pay his investors back. The investor just gives backers digital currency, the metaphorical gold.  Yet, attorneys on the panel of seven kept returning to this question of whether such a token could really be thought of like a mineral ore and the SAFT as the instrument that financed the mine.  Wright disagreed with the idea, contending that the courts will not separate the coin from the SAFT. Rather, he argues they will look at the whole process.  In a conversation with CoinDesk afterwards, he said, ""That's the law.""  Coins as commodities  Yvette Valdez of Latham & Watkins complicated the concerns of entrepreneurs even more, premising her comments by saying, ""I don't think the pre-sale and SAFT is that simple.""  A commodities lawyer, Valdez raised an important question: have entrepreneurs been too focused on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is likely to have jurisdiction?  In her comments, she explained that it's long been a practice for, say, an oil company to sell forward contracts to refineries that say, effectively: ""We'll deliver 100 gallons of crude oil on this date for this price."" This is legal, she explained, because the refinery is a commercial merchant. There's no doubt that it will receive the oil and use it.  If a hedge fund tries to buy a contract like that, though, it becomes a financial derivative.  In the same way, a venture investor who buys a stack of tokens with a SAFT in advance probably isn't, for example, going to use them to stake racks of servers in their back offices to run, say, filecoin. They intend to sell them for a profit at some point.  ""The folks buying a utility token on a forward basis,"" she said, ""I don't really see an exemption.""  By the panel's end, it seemed as though token issuers faced even more legal landmines than when it started, but as Klayman put it, there's never a simple answer on these questions.  ""It's still the facts and circumstances,"" she said, adding:  ""There's no 'this is good' or 'this is bad.'""

42400687,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKQRe,1511607611,Here's What's Standing in the Way of a Tokenized Economy,"Dr. Pavel Kravchenko holds a PhD in technical sciences and is the founder of Distributed Lab.  In this opinion piece, the second of two parts, he describes the obstacles that must be overcome before blockchain technology can deliver on the promise of tokenization.      In my previous post, I described the potential benefits of tokenizing assets. Right now there are two major problems standing in the way of this transformation.  The first relates to the most obvious benefit: potential access to any asset for anyone in the world.  From a regulatory compliance point of view, the ability for anyone to open an account and then buy or sell an asset is a mess.  Let’s just take the example of EU banks that don't deal with U.S. persons. As soon as they accept them as customers, they have to comply with U.S. regulations (regardless of jurisdiction) and that could be very painful since the U.S. has real power to punish any deviation from their rules. Therefore, the risks from having a U.S. customer are much bigger than the profits from them.  Obviously, the procedures for compliance and anti-money-laundering (AML) rules, and generally regulation on the whole, always depend on the specific jurisdiction, and may not necessarily meet the needs of the market.  There are a few tendencies, however, that will eventually make it possible to trade securities (tokenized assets will be mainly considered securities) globally.  Digital identity  First, this thorny issue will be resolved by unification of AML and know-your-customer procedures and supported by market leaders, as, for example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Howey test has become the de facto standard for determining when a token is a security.  Second, eventually developed countries will start using digital identities, as is necessary to automate KYC and AML procedures. The spread of digital identity solutions such as Estonia's e-residency is already underway and it will positively influence the opportunities for tokenization, because digital passports are also capable of signing transactions. As soon as digital identity is used, all document flows can also become digital, which will significantly simplify compliance procedures.  Third, initiatives that create standards for information sharing and protection – such as BankID schemes in Sweden, Norway and the Ukraine and the EU’s PSD2 and GDPR regulations – amplify the need for changes at businesses.  Organizations at the very heart of the financial world, the banks, governments, card payment networks, have already woken up and, understanding the potential of a global market, are ready to discard many of the intermediaries and regulations that surrounded them on all sides.  We can see signs of movement towards that goal as banks are launching digital services, the European Commission is issuing directives to the financial sector based on the principle of open data and competition, and card networks are creating open APIs.  In the meantime, the question of KYC in tokenization can be resolved by limiting the circle of investors or use cases for which all processes can be digitized – for example, keeping them in a sandbox environment.  Standards missing  The second obstacle to tokenization is the lack of infrastructure and some standardized approaches to tokenization.  Very often people associate tokenization simply with the creation of a token on a public blockchain. But that’s just 10 percent of the whole process.  A public or private blockchain in itself only provides the function of storing information about the asset, with limited capacity to carry out transactions. Any complete tokenization system will include:  Managing the privileges of users and system administrators  Life-cycle management of an asset (issuance, withdrawal from circulation, etc.)  Security management  Integration of KYC and AML systems  Integration with payment gateways  Managing trading commissions and limits  Mobile and web apps  Exchange modules or integration with external exchanges  Moreover, there is a noticeable trend where each organization that manages assets seeks to create its own tokenization system, as in the case of real estate tokenization platforms that have been popping up. This makes sense, since it prevents centralization and allows different systems to compete for users.   Hence, it is likely that in the future each organization will own its own system – just like now every company has its own accounting and reporting systems. For that reason, the development of across-the-board technical standards for the design and versioning of a system and the creation of all its components is a critical factor for integration into business.  Properly documented technology makes it possible to use the same components of a platform repeatedly, increasing reliability and predictability, mitigating risks in development and integration, and most importantly, reducing the time to bring a product to market.  Motivated to change  The good news is that there's a strong impetus to build such linkages, even among incumbents that stand to be disrupted by a tokenized economy.  Businesses will drive changes in regulation and infrastructure, voting with their money, and finally the community will move to resolve higher-order problems – such as the interaction of various ecosystems, demonstrable security, joint asset management, mathematically provable settlement and auditing, and much more.  I strongly believe that tokenization will be the next big thing that will drive growth of world GDP and make entrepreneurs' lives easier.  Everything that can be tokenized, will be tokenized.

Although the system is not without its flaws, significant progress has been made over the previous two and a half years. However, when it pertains to Ethereum wallets, there is still some work to get done. Jibrel Network, a Swiss company registered in Zug, is developing the jWallet, a product whose performance extends far beyond stashing cryptocurrencies.JWALLET INTEGRATES CRYPTOCURRENCY AND STANDARD INVESTINGFor the time being, jWallet comes to the public. Anyone looking for a different kind of Ethereum and ERC20 wallet can give it a go, although one has to keep in mind the software is still in the alpha stage of development. Problems may occur, and it is not advisable to store much money in this wallet until the team releases a stable version. The competition is warming up in the Ethereum wallet division, which can only be considered to be an advantage.Perhaps one of the most interesting feature of jWallet is support for bonds, commodities, and equities. Considering that all of this will be stored in digital form on the Ethereum blockchain, it seems the team will have a lot of ""conversion"" work to do. It is unclear whether they are talking about traditional bonds or new products to be issued in addition to Ethereum specifically. Assuming it is the former, there will need to be an official conversion process to turn bonds into digital assets of some kind. We will hopefully find out more about this in the future.The jWallet is still mainly designed to store Ethereum and Ethereum-related forms of money. It is good that this business has created its own wallet, especially after it raised US$ 3 million to do exactly that. Some of its financiers include ArabianChain, the TaaS Fund, and Aurora Partners. Building a brand-new robust Ethereum wallet from the ground up is no easy feat. Moreover, given the recent issues concerning scams, phishing sites, and Parity, it is apparent there is a need for more desirable solutions.It is pretty interesting to see assistance for fiat currencies in jWallet as well-- or more specifically, tokens created by the Jibrel Network itself. Six different fiat currencies are supported: USD, EUR, GBP, AED, CNY, and RUB. It seems these tokens are designed to compete with Tether, although there are few specifics available regarding how these assets are backed. The logical explanation is that users will convert these fiat-pegged tokens for actual money, although it remains to be seen how that will work exactly.While there are many wallets with support for multiple cryptocurrencies already, they aren't suited for much more than that. A great deal of buyers want convenience more than anything else. This means they are less inclined to obtain a cryptocurrency wallet as well as another solution for more traditional investments. The Jibrel Network thinks that now is a good time to bridge the gap between both worlds. As an outcome, its jWallet product not only supports cryptocurrencies and digital tokens, but also bonds, commodities, and equities.In the meantime, the jWallet's alpha version supports the storage, transfer, and conversion of ERC20 tokens. No user data is stored by the company and it does not get a copy of one's wallet's private key either. Everything is stored locally, which should put a great deal of people's minds at ease. Without any need to sacrifice security or convenience, the jWallet is a pretty interesting creature.

Although the system is not without its flaws, significant progress has been made over the previous two and a half years. However, when it pertains to Ethereum wallets, there is still some work to get done. Jibrel Network, a Swiss company registered in Zug, is developing the jWallet, a product whose performance extends far beyond stashing cryptocurrencies.JWALLET INTEGRATES CRYPTOCURRENCY AND STANDARD INVESTINGFor the time being, jWallet comes to the public. Anyone looking for a different kind of Ethereum and ERC20 wallet can give it a go, although one has to keep in mind the software is still in the alpha stage of development. Problems may occur, and it is not advisable to store much money in this wallet until the team releases a stable version. The competition is warming up in the Ethereum wallet division, which can only be considered to be an advantage.Perhaps one of the most interesting feature of jWallet is support for bonds, commodities, and equities. Considering that all of this will be stored in digital form on the Ethereum blockchain, it seems the team will have a lot of ""conversion"" work to do. It is unclear whether they are talking about traditional bonds or new products to be issued in addition to Ethereum specifically. Assuming it is the former, there will need to be an official conversion process to turn bonds into digital assets of some kind. We will hopefully find out more about this in the future.The jWallet is still mainly designed to store Ethereum and Ethereum-related forms of money. It is good that this business has created its own wallet, especially after it raised US$ 3 million to do exactly that. Some of its financiers include ArabianChain, the TaaS Fund, and Aurora Partners. Building a brand-new robust Ethereum wallet from the ground up is no easy feat. Moreover, given the recent issues concerning scams, phishing sites, and Parity, it is apparent there is a need for more desirable solutions.It is pretty interesting to see assistance for fiat currencies in jWallet as well-- or more specifically, tokens created by the Jibrel Network itself. Six different fiat currencies are supported: USD, EUR, GBP, AED, CNY, and RUB. It seems these tokens are designed to compete with Tether, although there are few specifics available regarding how these assets are backed. The logical explanation is that users will convert these fiat-pegged tokens for actual money, although it remains to be seen how that will work exactly.While there are many wallets with support for multiple cryptocurrencies already, they aren't suited for much more than that. A great deal of buyers want convenience more than anything else. This means they are less inclined to obtain a cryptocurrency wallet as well as another solution for more traditional investments. The Jibrel Network thinks that now is a good time to bridge the gap between both worlds. As an outcome, its jWallet product not only supports cryptocurrencies and digital tokens, but also bonds, commodities, and equities.In the meantime, the jWallet's alpha version supports the storage, transfer, and conversion of ERC20 tokens. No user data is stored by the company and it does not get a copy of one's wallet's private key either. Everything is stored locally, which should put a great deal of people's minds at ease. Without any need to sacrifice security or convenience, the jWallet is a pretty interesting creature. The team does advise people to run it locally, though, or even to use the mobile app, which is also in alpha today.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | ICO,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/jwallet-ready-take-globe,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/15990427.jpeg
