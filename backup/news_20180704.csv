In a report published on Tuesday that discusses the rising trend of financial technology, the European Banking Authority (EBA) highlighted two banking-related use cases of blockchain: cross-border trade finance and identity authentication.  With a detailed explanation of how smart contracts and DLT can be utilized in the case of cross-border transactions, the EBA says the nascent technology can help solve a variety of issues. The paper's authors wrote:  ""A number of opportunities emerge from the use of DLT and smart contracts for trade finance. The most promising are the potential efficiency gains, cost reduction, and lower risk of duplicate financing and loss or manipulation of documents.""  That said, the EBA also noted the emerging technology still faces potential risks as applicable law remains uncertain at the moment. As such, conflict of interests may occur among DLT nodes that are located in different jurisdictions.  The EBA went on to explain:  ""For example, a digitally signed contract might not be enforceable in all the jurisdictions. It is essential to establish the applicable jurisdiction, in case of conflict, and the dispute mechanisms, when a dispute arises. ""  The EBA's comment notably follows news that a group of European banks has conducted a series of live cross-border trades using a jointly-developed blockchain platform. Those firms have said they want to expand the platform to elsewhere in the region.  Elsewhere in the report, the banking regulator also said that DLT can potentially streamline the ID verification process in European banks' customer due diligence since data can be shared in a distributed network.  However, the EBA said one of the unresolved questions in the application is how to ensure each party on a DLT network conducts a comprehensive due diligence process so that incomplete or invalid data will not be shared among different nodes.

The leading cryptocurrency looked overbought yesterday, as per short-duration indicators, having rallied to $6,681 on Bitfinex on Monday - the highest level since June 22.  Consequently, BTC fell back to $6,414 earlier today and was last seen trading at $6,530 - down 2.2 percent on a 24-hour basis.  Clearly, the bullish momentum has waned in the last 24 hours, still, the technical charts are biased to the bulls. Further, the probability of BTC rallying to $7,000 (psychological hurdle) remains high while prices are holding above the former resistance-turned-support of $6,341, as seen in the chart below.  4-hour chart  BTC breached the double bottom neckline resistance of $6,341 on Saturday, confirming a short-term bullish reversal and opening doors to $6,927 (target as per the measured height method). Further, it built a nice base (marked by a circle) around $6,341 before staging a high volume rally to $6,681 on Sunday.  Clearly, $6,341 is a strong support and only a break below that level would weaken the bull case.  Currently, BTC is trading well above the neckline support and is looking northwards as indicated by the double bottom breakout and bull flag breakout.  Daily chart  The falling channel breakout and the bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving average (MA) indicate the rally from the June 24 low of $6,755 is likely to continue in the days ahead.  On the way higher, BTC may encounter resistance at (June 19 high), $6,880 (upper Bollinger Band), $7,067 (50-day MA).  View  Bitcoin is seen rising to $7,000 in the short-term and could rally further if its move toward the psychological hurdle is backed by a sharp rise in the daily trading volume.  A break below $6,341 (former resistance-turned-support) would weaken the bull case. However, only a daily close below $6,275 (Monday's low) would abort the bullish view.  A daily close below $5,755 (June 24 low) would signal a revival of the sell-off from the May high of $9,990 and would shift risk in favor of a drop to $5,400 (November 12 low).

In order to pursue applications that rebuild social trust and boost transparency in government, Eddie Hughes, a member of Parliament from the U.K. Conservative Party, argued in a report released Wednesday that the government should ""appoint a public-facing chief blockchain officer,"" according to a report from City A.M.  The proposed chief blockchain officer should be focusing on shaping strategy for the tech's use in public services, with a long-term goal to reduce the government's annual expenditure by one percent, the report said.

42380951,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92xM1,1530691223,"Among Blockchain-Friendly Jurisdictions, Malta Stands Out","Marlene Ronstedt is a writer and journalist whose work has appeared in German and English publications including WIRED Germany. Currently, she is working for Neufund as a blockchain reporter.  André Eggert is a partner at the law firm of LACORE LLP and the legal architect of Neufund.org, a platform for primary offerings of tokenized equity.      Among the handful of blockchain-friendly jurisdictions around the globe, Malta stands out with perhaps the most forward-thinking regulatory agenda.  In a testament to its success, the European island state has attracted a couple dozen blockchain businesses, such as the crypto exchange Binance and our company, the equity fundraising platform Neufund. A recent study from Morgan Stanley shows that Malta has established itself as the No. 1 spot for crypto trading.  Malta has achieved this in part by removing regulatory uncertainty. Also, in contrast to other jurisdictions, Maltese legislators understand that blockchain is much more than just cryptocurrencies. And Malta is not simply being lenient to attract business, which could be said of Zug, Switzerland – whose loose interpretation of what constitutes a non-profit attracted many crypto companies, which fundraised in the name of the social good to skirt U.S. securities law.  Instead, Malta is writing laws for tomorrow's economy rather than trying to impose yesterday's rules upon it. Consider the unprecedented way it is legally recognizing smart contracts and DAOs.  Malta created a legal framework earlier this year which defines DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) as a new type of legal entity called ""Technology Arrangements."" Next to the newly passed Technology Arrangement Bill and the Virtual Currencies Bill there will be also a new regulatory body: the Digital Innovation Authority (MDIA). Because why should the MFSA (the Maltese equivalent of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) oversee blockchain businesses if new competencies are needed?  Instead of giving out licenses, requirements for which were established decades ago, the MDIA will audit the code of smart contracts. And in some cases, the MDIA will determine whether a business is eligible to obtain a license or not solely on the basis of code.  It is also the MDIA which will be in charge of auditing the code of DAOs and granting them the title of a ""Technology Arrangement."" One can think of a Technology Arrangement as something similar to a limited company. It is a legal architecture that grants a DAO rights and duties just as a registered company would. The major difference, however, is that a DAO runs without managerial supervision.  Such a legal arrangement has never existed before and thus sparks a lot of open questions. ""The task wasn't just limited to creating an artificial legal personality, we also had to analyse how the technology has come about and predict how it might evolve,"" said Maltese fintech entrepreneur and blockchain expert Abdalla Kablan who has been advising the government and wrote parts of the legislation. He added:  ""The idea was to get the public to become aware and understand that it may be beneficial to society as a whole to recognize that a technology arrangement could indeed operate better and more safely if it had a legal personality allowing it to take into consideration all the rights and remedies in case of financial or even 'physical' harm, to all those around it.""  Whether a business can get licensed by the MDIA is determined through the ""financial service test."" The test looks at whether a financial product or business falls under the European MIFID framework. If not, then the MDIA is in charge of licensing a business and auditing code. The code is audited by external parties to avoid bottlenecks, since the country is expecting an influx of businesses applying for licenses with the MDIA.  Rights for robots  Beyond the crypto community, the law has some staggering implications for society: A scenario in which autonomous robots can potentially operate as legal personas.  Consider this: A DAO can do the same things a corporation can, but instead of shareholder resolutions or management actions, the decisions are made and executed by artificial intelligence and smart contracts.  Under the proposed statute, a Maltese DAO incorporated as a Technology Arrangement could, for example, buy real estate in another EU country, just like any other legal person. Furthermore, the DAO could tokenize some of its ownership as securities and sell them on decentralized exchanges to other DAOs, companies or investors made out of flesh and blood.  Suddenly, we would have a world where humans and software are both legal entities.  The moment the law was be enacted in June, a Maltese DAO could legally acquire land in all other 27 EU member states. Due to an EU treaty, member states are obliged to acknowledge the existence of legal entities or legal personas from other member states.  Meaning, for example, that Germany or France cannot forbid robots, AI, or software to grab some prime real estate or close any other business deal. Additionally, the Union cannot just wipe out legal personas from its member states.  A model for the EU  Stepping back, the European Union does not currently have a specific legal framework governing blockchain-related activities, but European regulators are inclined to get an EU-wide regulation out.  Malta's sandbox serves as an example for these regulators in Europe and the rest of the world. The result of this adventure will most likely influence the decisions of EU lawmakers.  This raises an interesting question, however: Would Malta retain its status as the ""blockchain island"" once Brussels has adopted similar policies?  Definitely, we think. Beyond the law, the country is working on creating an entire blockchain ecosystem. This includes new programs and departments at universities, as well as co-working spaces aimed at blockchain companies.  The country is also thinking about reforming the banking sector to push for more crypto friendly banks for founders. Those moves cannot be easily copied by other regulators since such an ecosystem grows naturally and is more sustainable.  ""Even the bravest projects, tech-related or not, require the right environment to grow bigger and stronger and we are determined to offer that environment in Malta,"" said Silvio Schembri, the Maltese Junior Minister for Financial Services, Digital Economy and Innovation.  In conclusion, compared to other countries, Malta has solidly established itself as a blockchain hub (view this map in order to see and follow the status of other crypto-friendly jurisdictions around the world). But with its bold moves, Malta is kicking off an urgently needed European debate about how new technologies should be regulated.

42380955,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92xSJ,1530681304,Binance Halts Trading Over 'Atypical' Crypto Transactions,"UPDATE (July 4, 8:07 UTC): Binance said that it resumed trading at 8:00 UTC on July 4 and will release a ""more in-depth explanation of today's maintenance in a later announcement.""  UPDATE 2 (July 4, 9:23 UTC): Binance confirmed the system maintenance was due to irregular trades of the SYS cryptocurrency and has released an incident recap.      Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, suspended trading services on Wednesday after irregular transactions were reported on its platform.  Syscoin, a distributed network based on a fork of the bitcoin protocol, said on Twitter around 21:00 UTC on Tuesday that it noticed a potential issue and subsequently asked exchanges to suspend the trading of its SYS cryptocurrency.  The project later confirmed after an investigation that it discovered ""odd trading behavior coupled with atypical blockchain activity.""  Though Syscoin has not yet disclosed details from its investigation, the issue appeared to have resulted in unusual transactions on Binance's SYS order books, which accounted for over 87 percent of the cryptocurrency's total trading volume, data shows.  The 24-hour price high data from Binance indicates that at one point one SYS was worth 96 BTC while its price had previously maintained around 0.00004 BTC. Yet it is unclear how many SYS tokens might have been executed at the unusual price.  Syscoin co-founder Sebastien DiMichele told CoinDesk:  ""My understanding is that yes, Syscoin was sold for 96 BTC per unit at one point today. We saw massive bot activity, our community let us know that they were having trouble with deposits at Binance.""  Three hours after Syscoin's Tweet, Binance said in a blog post that it has halted the platform's all trading services as it will ""undergo system maintenance,"" during which ""trading, withdrawals and other account functions will be suspended.""  While Binance initially didn't specify whether the overall halt directly resulted from Syscoin's reported blockchain issue, the exchange indicated in a follow-up post that the system maintenance is due to some"" irregular trading"" on the platform.  ""Due to irregular trading on some APIs, Binance will remove all existing API keys as a precautionary security measure. All API users are requested to recreate their API keys,"" Binance wrote. The company has not responded to CoinDesk's request for further comment.  Following the event, the price of Syscoin surged by around 100 percent to nearly $0.50, which was followed by a rapid decline to around $0.28, according to price data from CoinMarketCap.

42380953,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92xOX,1530676971,Crypto Exchanges Are Suddenly Being Censored In Iran,"""Every crypto exchange in Iran [has been] filtered since May.""  That's how one Iranian bitcoin advocate, speaking on condition of anonymity, described a new wave of government censorship that has cut Iranians off from vital links to the crypto economy ahead of a scheduled renewal of U.S. sanctions in August and November.  Several Iranians exclusively told CoinDesk they are having trouble accessing crypto exchanges like Binance, Blockchain and LocalBitcoins, even with virtual private networks (VPNs) and other workarounds that were already commonplace because of international sanctions.  It's a scenario that highlights the complexities of censorship resistance – a country whose people are most in need of an economic lifeline are now ostracized from empowering services.  ""Many people are using it [bitcoin] as a hedge instrument because buying BTC is easier than going into the black market to buy yourself US dollars,"" said the Iranian source, a cryptocurrency veteran with deep ties across Tehran's startup scene.  No speculative investment, the source is referencing how Iranian's currency reached an annual inflation rate of 127 percent on July 2. (For some Iranians, bitcoin's volatility appears trivial in the face of rampant inflation and political uncertainty.)  ""[President Rohani] doesn't want Iranians to transfer foreign currency, especially dollars, outside the country,"" said Ahmad Khalid Majidyar, director of IranObserved Project at the Middle East Institute, a think tank in Washington D.C. that offers non-partisan political analysis.  Majidyar told CoinDesk:  ""If [diplomacy] falters, it would mean there are more restrictions, and definitely cryptocurrency would be impacted as well.""  Most experts agree that the current economic crisis, one tied to international relations, has spurred Iranian authorities to seek strict controls on cryptocurrency. (A CoinDesk survey of 200 domestic crypto users revealed a majority used the tech for cross-border payments.)  In light of the political situation, the censorship has been a long time coming.  In December 2017, Iran's anti-money laundering body forbid financial institutions from working with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. This policy stipulated the Central Bank of Iran cannot take ""any action to promote"" decentralized currencies.  Then in May, the Iranian Financial Tribune reported Mohammad Reza Pourebrahimi, head of the parliament's economic committee, warned crypto traders could harm the Iranian economy if they continued to spend billions through international marketplaces.  Signs of censorship  Now, firsthand accounts from Tehran imply a quiet push toward stricter censorship is currently underway. (To date, the Rohani administration hasn't issued any official statements condemning individual cryptocurrency users.)  According to a second anonymous source in Iran, however, it appears as though government censors are now examining network traffic via a process called ""deep packet inspection""– a tactic Iranian authorities used in the past– to restrict VPN access to crypto platforms.  He said as of this week LocalBitcoins is no longer accessible, and that imported cryptocurrency mining equipment is also banned. Adding credibility to the assertions the government is behind the move, is the fact that cryptocurrency service providers say they aren't blocking local users.  An Iranian tech blog reported Binance told one concerned user of the exchange platform that it has no plans to restrict regional services.  A Binance spokeswoman told CoinDesk, ""the responsibility rests on the user"" to use Binance lawfully, including both international sanctions and local restrictions. She declined to comment on Iran specifically.  The second anonymous source said buying and selling cryptocurrency with Iranian rials is forbidden, although people still trade with each other in person.  When asked to describe the sentiment among cryptocurrency users in Iran, he simply answered: ""Uncertainty.""  Crypto-nationalism  All in all, these actions represent a stark reversal for a country that had appeared on the verge of a blockchain boom. (That same 2017 CoinDesk survey also showed the majority of Iranian respondents believed the government would actively advance cryptocurrency.)  Even as recently as February 2018, blockchain startups were working closely with regulators to consider a legal framework for cryptocurrencies.  Further, that same month the Information and Communications Technology Minister, MJ Azari Jahromi, announced plans for a national cryptocurrency. Majidyar said Rohani is still moving forward with this high-tech plan for a ""separate financial system.""  Still, others think Rohani, Jahromi and other Iranian moderates may be mirroring the ""blockchain not bitcoin"" sentiment popular among traditional institutions abroad.  ""Of course, it would be subject to the same sanctions,"" the Middle East Institute's Majidyar said. ""But they just want to control prices even more.""  Since most international banks already shun Iranians, Majidyar expects this censorship of decentralized cryptocurrencies will worsen if diplomacy falters.  Yet bitcoin enthusiasts on the ground reported feeling anxious, not hopeless. Some continue trading crypto between acquaintances in exchange for local cash.  The first anonymous source told CoinDesk:  ""They always find the way.""

Tax enforcement agencies from the U.K., Australia, Canada and the Netherlands will join the IRS in forming the Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement (J5) to prosecute tax crimes, according to a press release. The organization was formed in response to ""a call to action"" by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to ""do more"" on the crackdown on tax crimes.  The entity has already met, with cryptocurrencies coming up as an area of concern in financial crimes.  In a statement, Dutch Fiscal Information and Investigation Service general director Hans van der Vlist said:  ""The unique thing about the J5 is the operational collaboration between five countries on tackling professional enablers that facilitate offshore tax crime, cybercrime and the threat of cryptocurrencies to tax administrations, as well as making best use of internationally available data and technology.""  Johanne Charbonneau, general director of the Canada Revenue Agency, also said that J5 is building a ""serious commitment"" in an international cooperation that will fight against serious international tax crimes, including cybercrimes through ""the use of cryptocurrencies.""  No details are disclosed regarding how J5 will work together to end the threats received from cryptocurrency-related tax crimes, but an update on its initiatives is expected in late 2018, according to the news release.
