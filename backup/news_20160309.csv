42426687,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw2Ph,1457559020,How Bitcoin Brought Electricity to a South African School,"Late last month, the non-profit MIT Enterprise Forum of Cambridge hosted an event focused on new developments in clean energy distribution and how blockchain technology could play a role in how electrical grids of the future are built.  The event was sponsored by the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, a government-funded agency that promotes clean energy expansion in the state, and included presentations from companies like IBM and startups like Consensys, Lo3 Energy and Grid Singularity.  Arguably the most notable demonstration of the night came in the form of Usizo, a crowdfunding platform designed to facilitate energy payments between donors and select schools in South Africa. The project was first announced last fall.  Grid Singularity CEO Ewald Hesse led the demo from Boston, with Lorien Gamaroff, CEO of Johannesburg-based blockchain startup Bankymoon, calling in via Skype from nearly 8,000 miles away, at the Emaweni Primary School in Soweto, South Africa.  As Gamaroff remarked, the nature of how power in South Africa has changed over the years. Rather than paying for electricity after it is received at a home or business, end users are instead paying for this electricity upfront.  For example, if a homeowner wanted to power their home for a day, they would go to an approved vendor who, in exchange for payment, would provide a special token that can be deposited in a smart meter. After the exchange, the lights turn on.  Gamaroff argued that this system can be prohibitively expensive, particularly for those living in rural communities. The system also relies on the existence of third parties who act as middlemen between end users and the power companies.  ""A prepaid payment system makes the energy a lot more expensive because those vendors need infrastructure, there’s traveling cost, and it’s also very expensive to make those payments,"" Gamaroff explained. ""If you’re in a remote area and your lights go out, there’s no way to make a payment, no easy or electronic way to do it.""  This situation, he continued, could be circumvented through the use of digital currency, explaining at the time:  ""You can now have a smart meter, a bitcoin blockchain-enabled meter, and foreign donors can send money directly to the meter without having to send it to an organization that will take or re-distribute the funds.""  Smart payments  The concept of using digital currency to prepay for electricity isn’t a new one – Gamaroff himself was involved in a previous effort back in 2014 aimed at facilitating prepaid electricity to South African residents using bitcoin.  Yet the new effort takes a more philanthropic approach, emphasizing bitcoin's use case for international aid through its crowdfunding platform structure.  As demonstrated by Gamaroff and Hesse, the project involves two components – the smart meter programmed to accept digital currency and positioned at the building set to receive power, and the crowdfunding platform through which donors can contribute bitcoin.  Gamaroff shared photos on Twitter prior to the MIT event, showcasing the installation of the smart meter:    Installing the #Blockchain #SmartMeter for the #Usizo project at Emaweni Primary School in #Soweto #Johannesburg pic.twitter.com/Cua35eQXzo        — Lorien Gamaroff (@gamaroff) February 19, 2016      Donors who contribute using the platform can see how much electricity a school consumes over a given period and can calculate how much power will be contributed based on how much BTC is given.  Real-time demo  For the MIT demo, Hesse transmitted 1 BTC to the smart meter in Soweto, an amount that would provide roughly three weeks of electricity to the Emaweni Primary School.  Meanwhile, in Soweto, a large gathering of school administrators, teachers and staff waited in the darkness – it was the middle of the night local time – for the payment to arrive.  ""Now what’s happening is that it’s now going through the blockchain, the meter is going to take the payment, it will calculate the tariff and load the required amount of electricity onto the meter,"" Gamaroff explained during the demo.  Despite an initial delay, the system worked – the lights in the classroom turned on, sparking a wave of applause and cheers from both the crowd in Boston and the school staff gathered in Soweto.  Within moments, celebration and music broke out at the Emaweni Primary School as the demo concluded.  Future of project  What comes next for the Usizo project?  According to Hesse, whose startup is developing a platform for connecting power companies through the use of blockchain technology, the project won’t be consigned to merely serving as a test.  He told CoinDesk that the future of Usizo will likely involve its management under some kind of non-governmental organization (NGO structure). Hesse said that the project has already generated positive interest from those parties, though when the transition would take place isn’t certain.  Yet for those educators in Soweto, the platform offers the potential to help keep the lights on – and to help those students to keep on learning.

42426688,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw2Rh,1457549637,Why a TechCrunch Editor Left His Job for a Bitcoin Startup,"Why did one of TechCrunch’s longest-serving editors leave a media giant for a bitcoin startup?  For outgoing East Coast editor John Biggs, the answer is that he’s been leading one already in his spare time for the last year. Peer-to-peer payments startup Freemit has been Biggs’ passion project since December 2014, and the company has since raised more than $150,000 from angel investors, according to data from Crunchbase.  Still, Biggs is just now making the leap to Freemit full-time, leaving his job late last month at a company he’d been with for nearly 10 years. According to Biggs, it was now or never.  ""I basically quit because I knew that, first off startups are either time consuming or they’re not, and if you don’t make them time-consuming, you lose focus. I figured it’s time for a bit more hustle, it’s time for more focus,"" he told CoinDesk.  Biggs suggested his departure was due to his confidence in the Freemit product, the team that built it and the size of the opportunity he believes the bitcoin industry has to disrupt financial incumbents.  Biggs said:  ""We're in a bind, right now, because banks aren’t going to change to support the things we want them to support, especially faster cross-border payments. They already make a lot of money, and are quote-unquote good at it. My concern is they’re going to keep status quo until someone changes that status quo.""  In interview, Biggs went on to suggest that the move is likely to precede a period of more frequent announcements from the stealth startup, which he said could soon open to users.  Biggs said Freemit could open to an initial batch of as many as 7,000 beta users this month as part of what he called a ""staged rollout"".  He indicated that Freemit is watching the ongoing block size debate, and that the uncertainties surrounding potential changes to bitcoin’s transaction capacity could be a factor in such decision-making, although he doesn’t see a long-term issue with the current state of the network.  Further, he defended the technology in face of new criticism, stating that the debates ensnaring the bitcoin community are comparable to challenges faced, and ultimately overcome, by early Internet innovators.  Freemit's approach  Perhaps unsurprisingly, Biggs is bullish on Freemit’s ability to emerge as a major disruptive startup not just in bitcoin, but in FinTech.  To hit a larger target market, he said Freemit won’t emphasize denominating transactions in bitcoin as a currency, instead targeting new users who may be more familiar with traditional banking products and online payment startups such as PayPal.  ""The big difference is we’re a hybrid model,"" Biggs said. ""Most of the team has worked in banks, so they're well versed in how those systems work. Instead of going bitcoin first, we're connecting multiple paths until bitcoin becomes liquid.""  Biggs described this approach as contrary to the industry’s best-funded cross-border bitcoin payments startup, Abra, which has raised $14m in venture capital to date.  Abra uses a network of 'tellers' who serve to take the place of physical kiosks. Biggs lauded the model as an ""Uber for cash"", but suggested that Freemit will not take a similar approach to its service prioritizing ""fiat in, fiat out"" money movement.  To start, Biggs said Freemit intends to target international students and younger payments product users, comparing the functionality to that of Align Commerce, which helps small businesses send fiat transactions abroad using the blockchain.  Role reversal  Overall, Biggs expressed enthusiasm at his changing role in the tech industry, nothing that he's followed entrepreneurs for years in his TechCrunch role where he joined less than a year after the publication began.  Biggs said that he sees his past experience in media as an asset to the startup, and that so far, he hasn’t had trouble making the transition to his CEO role.  ""I think the experience of managing a distributed team and my media savvy is going to be useful,"" he said.  He added that certain aspects, such as raising funding, were ""less fun"" than he expected them to be, but that his family and friends are supportive of the transition.  ""Nobody’s said that I’m stupid to do it,"" Biggs said. ""My wife is even OK with it.""  For his part, Biggs has been a vocal supporter of the industry, driving coverage of the industry at TechCrunch and contributing posts about his experiences on the funding trail to CoinDesk.  Biggs suggested he'll continue to blog for TechCrunch as he builds out the startup, but that he is already learning to love his entrepreneur role, concluding:  ""I can understand why people can get addicted to it.""

42426673,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw1xh,1457538018,Australian Bitcoin Miner Withdraws Bid for Public IPO,"Australian bitcoin miner Bitcoin Group is returning $5.9m it raised from investors after the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) said the firm needed to raise more capital and resubmit its application.  The firm said in a 9th March statement to investors that it would return the funds after Australian securities officials deemed the firm ineligible to list due to concerns about its long-term operational viability.  The dispute followed the submission of a third-party working capital report by accounting and consulting services firm Grant Thornton.  ASX, as detailed in a letter sent to Bitcoin Group on 4th March, drew issue with the report's conclusion that Bitcoin Group would need to raise fresh capital in 2017 in order to stay operational after the bitcoin mining reward falls from 25 BTC per transaction block to 12.5 BTC.  Bitcoin Group disputed this finding in their investor note, arguing that Grant Thornton did not take into account possible price increases following the subsidy halving, as well as an expected drop in the mining difficulty or future efficiency gains in mining hardware.  The company said:  ""The directors consider that it is appropriate to now withdraw from the IPO process and consider proceeding with a new offer after blockchain halving has occurred and the price of bitcoin responds to the halving, which we expect to occur by September 2016.""  The withdrawal marks the latest incident in a long string of problems for the mining company in its dealings with Australian regulators.  Bitcoin Group announced its intention to conduct the first bitcoin-focused IPO back in the fall of 2014, a process that led to friction between regulators and the company following statements made on social media.

42426674,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw21h,1457536822,Chronicled Raises $3.4 Million to Bring Blockchain Verification to Sneaker Trade,"Chronicled, a startup leveraging blockchain tech to help authenticate collectible sneakers, has raised $3.42m in seed funding.  The round  was led by Hong Kong-based VC firm Mandra Capital and included support from avid industry investor Pantera Capital and Colbeck Capital Management.  Founded in 2014, Chronicled seeks to ensure the authenticity of consumer products using ‘smart tags’ that can be inserted in shoes and linked to a user’s Apple or Android app. Chronicled then uses blockchain technology to register the shoes on a distributed ledger, which it says allows for the creation of an ""open registry"" on which sneakers can be bought, sold and traded.  Chronicled hopes the system will appeal to three target markets: collectors, who want peace of mind when making purchases; retailers, which want to sell authentic items; and brands, which it believes will seek to leverage its ‘smart tags’ to attract consumers.  In a statement, Pantera partner Dan Morehead lauded the Chronicled team for its ability to deliver on product milestones, and what he described as the ease with which its core product may be adapted for larger markets.  Morehead said:  ""Authenticity verification and provenance of luxury goods and other physical items is a huge untapped market, and due to privacy concerns consumers will want to own the data history associated with their physical property, which is a benefit of a blockchain-based back-end.""  The Chronicled team also boasts experience in the blockchain industry, as it was co-founded by Ryan Orr, formerly of Ripple-focused startup incubator Crosscoin Ventures.  Further, Alex Mizrahi, founder of ChromaWay, and Symbiont founder Adam Krellenstein, are listed as advisory board members on the company website.  Chronicled said it plans to launch its sneaker authentication service in April.

42426672,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw1zh,1457532908,Bitwage Now Lets Employers Pay Workers With Debit and Credit Cards,"Bitcoin payroll startup Bitwage has added support for credit and debit card payments.  Users can can now link their credit or debit card numbers to their Bitwage account, allowing them to choose that employee payment option in addition to bitcoin and traditional wire transfers. The option has a standard monthly limit of $500.  President and founder Jonathan Chester said the startup explored various merchant acquirer options, ultimately settling on an acquirer he declined to name. Support for card payments is live as of today, according to Bitwage.  Chester said that the new offering was a response to feedback from the startup's clients, which have pushed for the added credit and debit card support.  He told CoinDesk:  ""From our eyes, it’s all about seeing how we can provide the most value to our users, whether it be to employers paying international wages, or users using our individual payroll system.""  Further, he said that the wage payment market today doesn’t have many options for employers looking to pay via card options, opening up a potential opportunity for the startup.  ""So with both a market opportunity presented by our customers and a lack of a solution, we decided to figure out how to go about doing this,"" said Chester.  The release, which follows an announcement that Bitwage that it had partnered with an undisclosed insurance carrier to cover cyberattacks, is the latest for the firm, which to date raised has raised $760k in funding. Bitwage recently completed a startup accelerator program hosted by the Silicon Valley-based incubator of French telecom giant Orange.  Launched alongside the card payments option is its API, which Chester said has been in beta testing in October. Bitwage has already integrated its API with Hubstaff, a workforce monitoring service.
