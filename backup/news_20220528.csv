37110,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=237629,1653780656,Know How Cardano Could Potentially Re-Define DeFi,"By employing blockchain technology, Cardano (ADA) claims to solve real-world problems. It has, for example, working with the Ethiopian government to monitor the educational progress of 5 million youngsters on its network. Students will receive a tamper-proof academic record as a result of the initiative, which might be useful if they are looking for work or considering studying abroad. Cardano has taken a planned approach to its development. The team believes in comprehensive research and testing prior to deployment. This is why Cardano&apos;s Alonzo Hard Fork took some time to be deployed on the mainnet. Alonzo Hard Fork is Cardano&apos;s third major update in the Shelly Era. The currency has five primary stages of development, commonly known as &apos;eras&apos; - Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire — all of which will improve the overall functionality of the network. The platform&apos;s final important improvement during the Shelley period, Alonzo, ushers it into the Goguen era. The Alonzo update has three stages: Blue, White, and Purple. They will be followed by Alonzo Red and Alonzo Black, who will add more people to the networks and fix any problems that have emerged. Alonzo Blue will add smart contracts to the network, similar to those present on the Ethereum network. Cardano&apos;s smart contract capabilities are a huge step forward, letting it compete with other programmable blockchains and greatly expand the range of solutions available to...",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | RESEARCH | FORKS,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/know-how-cardano-could-potentially-re-define-defi/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=know-how-cardano-could-potentially-re-define-defi,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

The announcement came after the president, an outspoken technocrat, proposed a bill to the parliament to legalize bitcoin use in the country. According to some, this move would transform the economy of a country known for its struggles. The legalization of bitcoin was supposed to iron out most of the issues the country&apos;s economy faced and shift the falling trend. However, while the deal held very lucrative prospects for the country, they have yet to be realized. The change in the legal tender has, for the time being, had no positive effects on the Salvadoran economy. As discussed below, this lack of change has left the country in economic turmoil.

This can be compared to how you would stake your cryptocurrency in a staking pool. What causes the difference is that with NFT staking, you are investing in the future of a blockchain project by holding onto unique digital assets. How to earn income through NFT? There are two ways to earn income from NFTS: By staking, in a staking pool By selling for a profit. How to Earn by Staking in a Staking Pool If you decide to stake your NFTS in a staking pool, you will earn income in the form of interest on your investment. However, the amount of interest you earn will depend on the size of your investment and the length of time that you stake your NFTS.

Since then, many Chinese have joined the bandwagon. This pro-crypto population spurred significant global growth, with many other cryptos launching after bitcoins&apos; success. While the prospects for crypto users in China seemed brighter than ever, this outlook was short-lived. A reversal in the state of affairs of crypto occurred following changes in the sector. These changes are discussed below. Government Intervention The period between 2010 and 2020 was the most favorable for both the users and cryptocurrencies in China. At the time, the country became the global leader in adopting, mining, and using bitcoin. In early 2013, corporations such as Baidu started accepting bitcoin payments. By 2020, China accounted for nearly two-thirds of global mining activity. However, due to government interventions, this activity dwindled.

However, like any social construct, the potential of experiencing metaverse crime exists, and there is a need to understand what measures need to be in place. First, let us understand why there is crime potential in the metaverse: Metaverses Mimic Real World Human Experiences Metaverse platforms such as Meta take user interaction from the webpages where written words, audio-visual and automated reactions define social experiences. They allow users to get first-hand experience by entering the spaces as avatars that see and engage with other users as people do in real life.

42420956,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcX6ksn,1653739680,NFT Art Museums Are a Good Idea,"The world of fine art is filled with gatekeepers. A select few – an elite echelon of curators, collectors and tastemakers – have the power to decide which art we should value. Society has largely accepted that imbalance as standard, because for centuries physical and economic constraints have prevented most people from meaningful participation in this ecosystem.  The metaverse is a paradigm shift away from that reality. Galleries, exhibits and museums – once restricted by limitations like scheduling, fundraising and the logistics of physically managing “bodies” of work – can now extend their presences in infinite ways.  Harold Eytan is CEO of Particle. This article is part of “Metaverse Week.""  Digital curators can produce more shows and react to important cultural trends and events in real time. And artists and collectors can now share spaces, collaborate and connect through art in virtual environments from anywhere in the world. Virtual reality (VR) headsets allow people to transcend geography and fully immerse themselves in a digital place.  Take the Museum of Crypto Art (MoCA), for example, a virtual museum built in Somnium Space. Co-founded by seminal digital art collector Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile and designed by Desiree Casoni, the virtual museum collects tokenized art pieces that were purchased as non-fungible tokens (NFT).  MoCA’s artworks are on display for anyone with an internet connection. And because NFT ownership is validated on the blockchain, the museum is able to extend access without diluting the monetary value of the works. In fact, Rodriguez-Fraile may be making the case for why NFTs have value.  With virtually none of the traditional overhead of a physical gallery, designers and curators are able to make the exhibitions as imaginative and as immersive as they’d like while spending less time and capital.  The same is true for architects, who are limited by little more than their imaginations while designing in the metaverse. Gone are spatial restrictions and cost barriers for building transformative, otherworldly experiences.  See also: Profile Pic NFTs Are Suffocating Crypto Art | Opinion  For museums, this means that each piece of art could have its own form-fitting building – or even world – where the message and character of the work is commented on or enhanced by its vivid and infinitely dynamic setting.  The metaverse enables creators to architect experiences in entirely new dimensions. What could art feel like on the Moon? In the center of a black hole? Or, if you want to bring it back to reality, metaverses like Somnium Space enable curators to incorporate the actual changing seasons and times of day.  Interacting with physical art is never going away, of course – nor should it. There’s nothing like being in the presence of a true tour de force. But the metaverse allows us to extrapolate that magic and expand access to a larger number of would-be art appreciators.  That newfound access is particularly important. As new generations spend more of their time online, museums and galleries are constantly looking for novel ways to bring their historic collections to wider communities.  Curators understand that art is more than just aesthetics and materials – it represents a moment in time and transmits bygone eras through a perceptive lens, teaching us about who we were and who we can be.  As traditional art spaces struggle to find consistent foot traffic, the metaverse gives these cultural institutions a means of revitalizing past worlds for digitally native audiences.  But how do we navigate ownership in a world where everything is accessible? Profile picture (PFP) collections have popularized NFTs by attaching identity to a digital artwork that can be monetized in its native form. What if we applied the same concepts to art’s great masterpieces?  Even more revolutionary than the metaverse’s increased access and new experiential forms is the blockchain’s ability to authenticate art. The physical art world is opaque, and it can be difficult to demonstrate provenance – even with masterpieces. Blockchain protocols, though, can make pricing and ownership transparent and can even be fractionalized among many owners.  See also: As Museums Go Dark, Crypto Art Finds Its Frame  Before today, most people could never own a Banksy – or any of the works that fetch millions of dollars at auction houses. But by transferring the value of a physical good to the blockchain and creating a legal structure to support that conversion, we can effectively fractionalize masterpieces and make them attainable to a much greater population.  More expansive ownership will give rise to a new generation of art collectors, catalyze greater interest in fine art and introduce myriad token-gating opportunities that build connection and community.  One of the great disconnects in the fine art world is that its mechanics don’t often reflect the ethos of the artists themselves. Does Banksy make art hoping that the select few will elevate his name to the art pantheon, so that his pieces can be sold to ultra-wealthy individuals for millions of dollars? Did Basquiat? Or Frida Kahlo? Probably not.  The metaverse expands access and introduces new ownership models, bringing art closer to the people – and to the human conditions that inspired the art in the first place.

This is the main achievement of sellers in the fall from April 2021. Stopping the price near $16 buyers began to form a global rebound and correction of the fall wave from November 2021. Although the ETC price fell much below the lows from May-July 2021 buyers behave much more confidently than in other cryptocurrencies. https://www.tradingview.com/x/dTX9KwpE/ In the weekly timeframe, we see that the weekly candle from 23 May was able to test the mark of $25.

However, on the other hand, few cryptocurrencies have been able to organize such a growth wave and so decently keep the price during the fall of the BTC.

Now stopping the wave of November 2021 is just as difficult, as there are no big buyers willing to buy AXS together in one place on the chart.

In a blog post, the site&apos;s chief product officer for streaming, Neal Mohan, wrote that the controversial new stage of the internet, Web3, opens up new opportunities for creators. Blockchain and non-fungible tokens enable creators to develop deeper relationships with their fans. &apos;A verifiable way for fans to own exclusive videos, photos, artwork, and even experiences from their favorite creators could be an enticing prospect for creators and their audience,&apos; the article states. However, Mr. Mohan commented in the report that YouTube must &apos;approach these new technologies responsibly with considerable care.&apos; What is The Effect of This Launch? YouTube&apos;s statement that creators have the right to be the owners of their content is unclear. NFTs do not automatically transfer copyright to owners. They are also detrimental to the environment because the energy required to mint them is enormous. Researchers estimate that NFT has the same carbon footprint as someone living in the European Union (EU). In addition, Cambridge University has extensively documented and analyzed the price of Bitcoin&apos;s environmental impacts.

The president, Najib Bukele, spearheaded one of the boldest political and economic moves of the decade. Under his leadership, El Salvador became the first country to lawfully permit bitcoin legal tender. The move sparked a wildfire in the crypto world, with many considering Bukele a trailblazer for the country. While some lauded the move as a beneficiary to the economy and the global economy, many others opposed it vehemently. However, things changed after considering the economy of the country. Within the scope of this article, we will explore these reasons in more detail. El Salvador Pre-Legalization El Salvador is a small Central American nation that is home to over six million people. It used the El Salvador colón as its official currency and relied on the USD. The South American state has an economic ranking below the global average. Despite being in the middle of the region, the world still perceives El Salvador as one of the poorer nations. A Struggling Economy El Salvador has a GDP of $54.6 billion, and 7% of its population is unemployed. Almost 20% of its GDP comes from remittances, which amount to $4.5 billion. And about 88.2% of GDP goes towards clearing public debt. Furthermore, corruption and favoritism are prominent contributors to their current economic position.

These high gas fees are a result of the increase in the adoption of its smart contract functionalities. Also, non-fungible tokens (NFT) based on Ethereum&apos;s blockchain surged in popularity throughout 2021 and the beginning of 2022, which also led to a surge in gas fees. However, as more projects are built on other smart contracts blockchains, waning interest in NFTs, and increasing hash rate, Ethereum gas fees have now dropped to the lowest since July 2021. Gas Fee At Lowest In 10 Months Calculated in gwei, Gas fees refer to the amount required to complete a transaction on the Ethereum network. Gas prices fluctuate constantly based on user demand and the supply of computational power from the network&apos;s miners. However, records indicate that Ethereum&apos;s gas fees have been steadily declining since the beginning of the year. It was reported earlier this month that ETH gas fees dropped to the lowest level in 7 months, reaching as low as $8. Clearly, the downward trend has persisted, as gas prices have recently dropped to their lowest point since July of last year. This was the month in which the NFT hype was at its highest point. It is expected that gas prices will continue to drop as consumer interest in NFTs continues to dwindle.

Gold tokenized NFTs and stablecoins carry the corresponding value in underlying gold assets stored in a vault in the real world. However, there are fundamental differences between the two classes of crypto assets. The following are notable disparities: The difference between the Creation of Gold Tokenized NFTs and Stablecoins The main difference between the two crypto entities is how they become part of the blockchain. NFTs depend on the creative process of a creator who designs unique features of a project that includes either art, audio-visual content, or popular text. The owner mints NFT by converting the new project into digital form to make it equally valuable on an NFT marketplace such as OPenSea. The asset then changes hands from one owner&apos;s wallet to another depending on how tradable it proves to be on the blockchain. Stablecoins acquisition occurs through purchase over centralized or decentralized exchange (DEX) systems that support different coins. Gold-backed stablecoins such as Tether Gold (AUXT) have a hedge against unpredictable price shifts of normal cryptocurrencies. The hedge comes from the coins being gold derivatives whose blockchain market behavior simulates the physical asset&apos;s price movements.

The famous musician Snoop Dogg showed his interest in the NFT space. KSI also invested some money in different NFTs. Katy Perry, Justin Beiber, and others were also wildly involved.
