42378542,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iZjZ,1453334191,Vermont Says Blockchain Record-Keeping System Too Costly,"The cost of using an implementation of the blockchain for a public records management system would outweigh any potential benefits, a report prepared for Vermont’s state legislature concludes.  The report  , commissioned as part of a broader legislative effort aimed at promoting economic growth, was prepared by Vermont's Secretary of State, Attorney General, and the Department of Financial Regulation. Representatives from the Center for Legal Innovation at Vermont Law School and the Uniform Law Commissionhttp://www.uniformlaws.org/ also contributed to the report, which was delivered to the legislature on 15th January.  The report’s authors state that Vermont could see some benefits from a system that is able to verify when a public record document is entered and by whom. However, the report raises questions about the cost of operating a state blockchain, how such a system would function within Vermont's legal framework for storing electronics records, and why a blockchain would be needed at all given the methods and requirements in place today.  The report’s authors state:  “In light of the very limited possible benefits and the likely significant costs for either entering into a private or public blockchain or setting up a state-operated blockchain, at this time, blockchain technology would be of limited value in conducting state business.”  Despite arguing against the creation of a blockchain-based public records system, the authors do note that it would offer some protection against forged or erroneous records.  “The hash of a document existing outside the blockchain and the hash registered within the blockchain will be identical if the documents are identical. If the documents are different (due to forgery, corruption, error, or other problems) the hashes will not match,” the report states. “Thus, the blockchain can potentially provide an immutable registration of a record, to which future records can be compared for authenticity.  The report goes on to suggest that Vermont could see some economic benefit from attracting companies that use the technology.  “To the extent that Vermont can be part of a process of economic and technological innovation that is likely to go forward with or without any legislative recognition, early acceptance of this technology may result in some economic benefit to the State,” the report explains.  The report also left the door open to future consideration of a state-run blockchain system, suggesting that a future implementation could be used to augment existing methods of public record keeping.  “Further study is required before considering it for the regular business of the State, and moreover, any application would certainly need to support rather than replace the existing records management infrastructure,” the report concludes.

42378537,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iZal,1453330328,Bitcoin Startup Joins Baidu-Backed FinTech Accelerator,"Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Gatecoin has joined a startup accelerator backed by Standard Chartered and Chinese Web services giant Baidu.  The SuperCharger Accelerator draws support from a number of regional and global firms, including Microsoft, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Ernst & Young and Fidelity. The program was cofounded by the TusPark Global Network, a co-working space operator.  The program, which opened for applications in the fall, began on 11th January and will run over three months, concluding with a demonstration day in April.  Gatecoin is receiving a $25,000 investment in exchange for a 5% stake in the startup, co-founder and CEO Aurélien Menant told CoinDesk. The company will also work with advisors to the program, which are drawn from those sponsoring the initiative as well as firms like Barclays and PayPal.  Menant said that during its time with the accelerator, the company will work on at least one proof-of-concept alongside the operation of its bitcoin exchange.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Gatecoin is currently working on integrating a bitcoin brokerage solution and a blockchain remittance service with an international bank operating in Asia and Africa. The proof of concept should be released by the end of the program. Other projects with the sponsoring companies are currently being studied.""  Some members of Gatecoin’s staff will relocate to the SuperCharger Accelerator offices in Hong Kong, while its engineering team will remain at its offices in the city.

The PBoC said in a 20th January release that it had held a meeting discussing the possibility in Beijing.  Attendees included central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan and deputy governor Fan Yifei, as well as a group of “relevant research institutions, major financial institutions and advisory bodies of experts”.  Notably, the central bank put together a team dedicated to digital currency research in 2014 – the work of which played into the Beijing meeting.  In addition, the PBoC received input from Citibank and Deloitte, as it weighed up how to issue the digital currency.  According to an unofficial translation of the release, the meeting urged the PBoC's digital currency research team to ""actively absorb the important results"" and to ""further clarify the strategic objectives of the central bank-issued digital currency"".  Further it should research key technologies and various digital currency applications for the ""early introduction of digital currency issued by the central bank"".  While the release gave no precise indication as to when the digital currency might be released, the central bank did give some indication of the factors driving its development.  Design of the digital currency, it said, should be based on ""economic, convenience and safety principles', while low cost and ""wide coverage"" were also requirements.

42378550,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iZsN,1453310809,IMF Paper: Regulation Should Preserve Benefits of Digital Currency,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has released a staff paper that examines the risks and use cases of virtual currencies such as bitcoin, recommending a balanced regulatory framework that will not stifle innovation.  The report was presented by IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde at the World Economic Forum in Davos during the panel ""Transformation of Finance"".  Following an an overview of virtual currencies, the report goes on to look at the potential implications of the use digital currencies (a definition that includes mobile coupons and airline miles) as well as distributed ledgers and blockchains.  Notably, the paper concludes that distributed ledgers have the potential to change finance by reducing costs and allowing for deeper financial inclusion in the long run.  The publication follows remarks issued by chief of the IMF Christine Lagarde in which she told the banking industry any disruption from such technologies is likely to take time.  Advantages for money transfer  The paper cites the potential for the technology to cut costs in remittances, where transaction fees via 'traditional' platforms can be high – with the global average being 7.7%.  Recognising that the cost of sending funds via the bitcoin network is estimated to be about 1%, it points out that ""blockchain-based intermediaries"" already offer money transfer services via bitcoin in countries such as Kenya and the Philippines.  The introduction of distributed ledgers, it says, could also reduce the time it takes to settle securities transactions, which currently take up to three days.  The paper continues:  ""Not only is this time-consuming, but trading parties also face settlement and counterparty risks. Major financial institutions have been investing substantially in this area. For example, Goldman Sachs applied for a patent on its blockchain-based settlement system (SETLCoin) in late 2015.""  The development of smart contracts, the report continues, could further boost the efficiency of transactions and settlements in the securities industry.  However, it noted they could introduce risks to financial stability by ""automatically propagating adverse events through the financial system"".  Regulatory and policy challenges  The IMF further examines the regulatory and policy challenges presented by virtual currencies in a number of areas of risk, including consumer protection, money laundering and financing of terrorism, taxation, exchange and capital controls, and monetary policy.  Still, it cautions that global authorities are likely to face difficulties in arriving at clear and consistent definitions due to their international reach ""decentralized nature [that] does not fit easily within traditional regulatory models"".  In conclusion, while recognising the difficulties of the challenges set out above, the paper recommends the creation of regulatory frameworks for virtual currencies at both the domestic and international levels that guard against risks without ""suffocating"" innovation.  ""Virtual currencies and their underlying technologies can provide faster and cheaper financial services, and can become a powerful tool for deepening financial inclusion in the developing world,"" said Lagarde.  She added:  ""The challenge will be how to reap all these benefits and at the same time prevent illegal uses, such as money laundering, terror financing, fraud, and even circumvention of capital controls.""

42378547,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iZnL,1453309205,Government Investigation of Alleged Bitcoin Creator Craig Wright Intensifies,"Australian tax authorities are reportedly beefing up their investigation of Craig Wright, the researcher who last year was alleged to be bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.  Technology publications Gizmodo and Wired claimed in early December to have found evidence tying Wright to Nakamoto, each citing anonymous sources. Some observers were skeptical of the claims in the aftermath of the publications, drawing comparisons toNewsweek’s ill-fated report that pointed to an elderly California citizen as the true identity of Nakamoto.  According to regional news source The Australian, a special team from the Australian Tax Office (ATO) has been called in to investigate Wright, whose claims for millions of dollars in tax credits sparked the inquiry.  Authorities are said to be investigating whether Wright's claimed bitcoin holdings were properly reported.  The report stated:  ""The [ATO] team has been interviewing Mr Wright’s former business associates in Sydney about tax claims he made through businesses and as an individual, while the ATO has been questioning former associates on supposed deals done through Mr Wright’s network of companies that claim to have about $300m in market cap­italisation backed through bitcoin.""  The ATO investigation ultimately led to a police raid on a home previously occupied by Wright.  Perhaps most notable is that, according to The Australian, government officials don’t believe that Wright is Satoshi – rather, they believe ""he may have created the hoax to distract from his tax issues"".  Authorities also reportedly believe that Wright may be currently residing in the UK.

42378545,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iZm5,1453285318,BitFury Moves Ahead on Bitcoin Device for Internet of Things,"Bitcoin mining giant BitFury is moving ahead with development of a previously announced prototype for a bitcoin-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) device.  The original prototype, announced last June, took the form of a consumer light bulb that was capable of mining small amounts of bitcoin.  BitFury  positioned the project at the time as one that would promote understanding of bitcoin technology, while providing developers with a platform for experimentation.  Despite a lack of public announcements on the initiative, BitFury head of product Niko Punin stated that the company’s vision for the ""portable mining device"" remains unchanged and that the device has simply undergone ""multiple iterations"" since it was first revealed.  Punin told CoinDesk:  ""We have a working prototype of a device with a working title 'MicroMiner' that has a Wi-Fi chip and a bitcoin mining chip built inside. It can be used as a starting point for any electronic IoT device that has bitcoin mining capability built in.""  The device will be open-sourced to the community when finished, Punin said, though it may be launched under a different name.  BitFury had originally suggested it aimed to collect ideas, open the project to developers and engage support teams on the project, before selecting the ""best prototypes"" for a mass market release.  Punin went on to note that the company plans to integrate its latest 16nm mining chip into the device, and that more updates would be likely as the project moves forward.
