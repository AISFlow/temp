42425100,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqwbh,1383072860,This man bought $27 of bitcoins in 2009 and they’re now worth $980k,"A Norwegian man who bought $27 worth of bitcoins in 2009 and forgot about them discovered their value had since shot up - to $980,000 at today's price.  Kristoffer Koch decided to buy 5,000 bitcoins for only 150 Norwegian kroner ($26.60) in 2009, after discovering bitcoin as part of an encryption thesis he was working on.  Koch probably didn't think he would become wealthy as a result, but his 5,000 BTC has turned into a goldmine. It was a wise investment by someone who stumbled across bitcoin before many others did.  Koch found that his bitcoins were worth 5 million Norwegian kroner ($886,000) when he checked back in on them. At the current Bitcoin Price Index of $196, those coins are now worth about $980,000.  After purchasing the 5,000 bitcoins, Koch pretty much forgot about them altogether. That is, until the price shot up to over $200 back in April and he started seeing press coverage about bitcoin's rise.  ""I thought to myself, didn't I have something like that?"" Koch told NRK, a Norwegian news outlet.  He did, and after figuring out the password to his wallet and seeing how valuable those bitcoins had become, he sold off a portion of them. Now he has an apartment that he purchased in an expensive part of Oslo, Norway. All thanks to the huge price gain that bitcoin has experienced, mostly in the past year.  It turns out that Koch's frivolous technology spending, against his girlfriend's wishes, actually turned out to be a great investment.  “I buy a lot of technical little things that I never have time to use, and this was the worst of all, the fact that I was buying fake money,"" Koch told NRK.  It’s not fake anymore, at least not to Kristoffer Koch.  Many people have become wealthy as a result of bitcoin's rise, although stories like this are rarely in the public eye. There's the story on the Bitcointalk forums about Kevin, who purchased 259,684 BTC for under $3,000 in 2011.  Then there is Erik Voorhees, who founded the bitcoin gambling site Satoshi Dice and sold it for 126,315 BTC, worth about $24.7 million at the current bitcoin price.  And The Verge reported earlier this year that Satoshi Nakamoto, the Bitcoin network’s mysterious founder, has an address with over one million bitcoins.  Of course, we shouldn't forget about the person who bought two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins back in 2009. Now, if only that person had kept them, or perhaps forgot about them and rediscovered them years later like Kristoffer Koch did.

42425099,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqwdh,1383063958,"Op-Ed: The bitcoin price has the potential to reach $1,820 by 2020","Editor’s note: This guest post was written by Radoslav Albrecht, co-founder of peer-to-peer bitcoin lending platform Bitbond.net. He has a background in economics, worked at an investment bank in London, and runs the German bitcoin blog bitcoins21.  The bitcoin price is probably the most discussed aspect about bitcoin. But only few discussions try to derive a quantified long-term price potential.  Do not mistake potential for prediction. As Yogi Berra said: “It is tough to make predictions, especially about the future.” Nobody is capable of accurate prediction. The price potential rather tells us where the price could go, given that certain assumptions will prove correct.  So if we’re not good at predicting something, why bother with an analysis about the bitcoin price potential?  Because it gives us a better understanding as to what drives the bitcoin price. It allows us to watch the identified drivers closely and refine our estimate of the potential.  What determines the bitcoin price?  The bitcoin price is the result of supply and demand for bitcoin. The more demand there is, the higher the price goes. The more supply there is, the lower the price (all else being equal).  The supply side of bitcoin is fairly well known, even if we look into the future. Bitcoin supply growth will drop below 15% annually very soon.  In the year 2020 the number of mined bitcoins will have surpassed 18 million. That means, when we omit bitcoins created through lending, the bitcoin supply will grow at a predictable rate that is on a decline.  The second factor that impacts supply is the so-called velocity of money. This figure tells us how often one unit of currency exchanges hands within a given time.  We calculate it by dividing the bitcoin transaction volume by the number of bitcoins in circulation. Currently this figure is at approximately 9 on an annual basis.  That means, one bitcoin is on average spent 9 times in one year. The velocity has remained stable for about six months now and since it’s already pretty high compared to fiat currencies we can assume that it will not get much higher.  Let’s look at demand next. Bitcoin is used in various types of transactions. The transaction volume drives demand for bitcoin which ultimately affects its price.  The following chart shows us the bitcoin transaction volume in billions of US dollars. Each point of the curve is the sum of all bitcoin transactions of the last twelve months (LTM) converted at the corresponding daily exchange rate. As we can see, the transaction volume has skyrocketed since April 2013.  The 4 bitcoin use cases  We can categorize bitcoin transactions into four use cases. For each use case, bitcoin competes with other existing solutions.  I will compare bitcoin with a major player in each category and try to estimate a potential future transaction volume for bitcoin until the year 2020. From that we can derive the bitcoin price potential.    1. Online payments    The largest bitcoin competitor in online payments is PayPal which reports to have 137 million active registered accounts. In the year 2012 the total value of transactions through PayPal was at $145 billion which is 18x the LTM bitcoin volume. Will bitcoin ever reach today’s volume of PayPal?  One thing that strongly impacts the adoption of bitcoin as a payment system is its exchange rate volatility.  All other aspects of bitcoin as a payment system are superior in my opinion. If bitcoin volatility keeps declining (which it currently is despite recent events), adoption and use in online payments will grow. And besides PayPal, there are other solutions where bitcoin has large potential to take away market share.  Also, it’s not just about taking away market share from other solutions. The PayPal 2012 transaction volume grew by 22% compared to 2011.  A growing world economy conducts an increasing number of payment transactions, so the market as a whole is growing rapidly. That’s why we can indeed assume that in 2020, bitcoin will reach today’s volume of PayPal transactions.  Additionally, there could be new applications for micropayments. I believe we will see entirely new revenue models here that can emerge through the availability of an instant and cost effective payment system like bitcoin. That way, additional transaction volume could be created.    2. Point of sale payments    There are many countries where most shops and restaurants don’t accept credit or debit cards. Costs and payment cycles are probably the main obstacles.  Bitcoin allows these shops to offer a cashless payment method that is convenient and cost effective for the merchant. Therefore it’s likely that adoption in point of sale payments will grow as well.  However, quantifying this is almost impossible. To keep our overall calculation conservative, we will assume the transaction value of this use case to be zero.    3. Remittances    This is a use case where bitcoin has a big advantage in my opinion. Even if we take exchange fees on both sides of one transaction into account, bitcoin is still much cheaper than the competition. It might take some time until the infrastructure is available to all people who send and receive money internationally, but it’s getting there.  [post-quote]  From its annual report we can see that Western Union transmitted $81 billion in 2012 in consumer-to-consumer transactions. This is a figure that bitcoin should be able to achieve in future years. And this again omits market growth and other competing solutions like bank wire transfers. These are lengthy and expensive in many cases, providing additional potential for bitcoin.    4. Investments    With emerging investment vehicles, bitcoin is now an asset class that is accessible to institutional investors.  This opens a whole new world. There are many reasons why bitcoin benefits a portfolio of financial assets. However, there is currently one limit to substantial investments in bitcoin.  The bitcoin market capitalization is roughly at $2.3 billion which is very small for an asset class. If you want to enter positions that are in the millions of dollars, your market impact is just too big. Or worse, the market for bitcoins doesn't provide sufficient liquidity for very large trades.  But speaking of the future, investments in bitcoin as an asset class will play a major role. With growing demand from the other three use cases market cap should go up. Consequently, larger institutional investments will follow.  Estimating bitcoin transaction volume from investing is about as tough as with the point of sale payments. But this one definitely can’t be neglected.  So here is one approach we can take. Even though bitcoin is an asset class on its own, it has characteristics of other asset classes.  These are mainly commodities and other currencies. Both of these asset classes don’t pay any dividends, just like bitcoin. And among other things they are used for similar purposes like bitcoin. Namely as a store of value and a medium of exchange.  Foreign exchange markets are the most liquid markets in the world in terms of transaction volume. Even if bitcoin is successful as a currency, it will probably take many years before it plays the role of a currency from an investment point of view.  That’s why we should just stick to a comparison with commodities for now. The most obvious thing to do is to compare bitcoin to gold. Other precious metals like silver would do as well, but let’s keep it simple.  The total amount of gold ever mined until 2012 was 174,100 tons. At a current spot price of $1,350 per troy ounce the total value of gold is $6.9 trillion.  The majority of gold wholesale trading is conducted through the London bullion market. From the historical market clearing turnover we can see that over the last years the average annual trading volume equals roughly the total amount of gold ever mined.  That makes an annual trading volume of $6.9 trillion at the current price. If we assume that bitcoin reaches 1% of this volume, we get a bitcoin transaction volume from investments of $69 billion.  Potential bitcoin transaction volume  When we sum up the estimates of each use case we get a potential annual bitcoin transaction volume of $295 billion. This is a 38x increase compared to today. In the last six months the bitcoin LTM transaction volume has increased sevenfold, so another 38x increase until the year 2020 does not seem out of range.  Potential bitcoin price  Now comes the juicy part. What does this all mean for the potential bitcoin price?  From the quantity theory of money we know that money supply (M) times the velocity of money (V) must equal the amount of goods in an economy (Y) times the price level (P).  This relationship always has to hold. If we know three components of this equation, we can calculate the fourth component. So let’s put it all together and derive an implied potential bitcoin price for the year 2020.  We know that in the year 2020 M will be approximately 18 million bitcoins.  We assume V to remain constant compared to today, so it’s got a value of 9.  We take the transaction volume, which we estimated to be at $295 billion, as a proxy for Y.  Solving for the price level P and showing the result by the more common inverse notation we get a potential price of USD 1,820 per bitcoin.  That’s quite a lot.  Again, please bear in mind that this is not a prediction!  Also, this is by no means advice to enter positions in bitcoin. There are many risks, some of which we might not even be aware of today. The price we calculated here is one that we might see in the future if bitcoin continues its extraordinary growth path for all use cases.  Concluding remarks  This article outlined how we can derive a potential bitcoin price. The stated figure is hypothetical. The interesting part is how bitcoin will be adopted in the various use cases.  If we want to discuss the bitcoin price of the future, it makes sense to dig deeper into possible adoption scenarios for each use case.  The highest degree of uncertainty in this calculation comes from the investment use case.  If the bitcoin price really reaches something like $1,820 until the year 2020, the market cap will be at $33 billion. That’s still small compared to the money supply of most countries and compared to the total value of gold.  But when we compare bitcoins with stocks, a $33 billion market cap would mean a lift from the small cap to the large cap segment.  In such a scenario we have a positive feedback loop. The more investors there are, the more that are likely to join in. That could accelerate the investment use case significantly. A higher market cap will also lead to decreased volatility. This benefits the payment and remittance use cases.  Therefore it is also important which path bitcoin adoption takes at what time scale. Bitcoin is a network good which means that each user benefits the more users there are. That's important to keep in mind when we analyze bitcoin adoption further.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Radoslav Albrecht,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/29/op-ed-the-bitcoin-price-has-the-potential-to-reach-1820-by-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd2dc52b9fcb96d08f970d3fce44084e58248743-1222x805.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425082,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqw7h,1383053482,BitPay processes $1 Million bitcoin order for Butterfly Labs,"BitPay has processed its largest ever single transaction – $1m for bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer Butterfly Labs.  This means that, at the current price of $192 per bitcoin, Butterfly Labs received an order for around 5,208 BTC-worth of mining equipment. BitPay then processed this order, depositing the equivalent in fiat currency in Butterfly Labs' bank account.  Despite the size of the order, the cryptocurrency payment processor processed it in their usual one-business-day timeframe.  Tony Gallippi, co-founder and CEO of BitPay, said: “The speed, reliability, and certainty of payments over the bitcoin network is expanding at a rapid pace, and in many regards has already surpassed the functionality of our 60-year old credit card networks.""  Butterfly Labs  is notorious for missing delivery deadlines, so bitcoiners awaiting the delivery of their mining equipment may be hoping this large transaction will allow the company to speed up its production and delivery.  “Butterfly Labs can now ship this merchandise with confidence that there will be no reversibility or chargeback of the payment, which is a significant risk when accepting credit cards online or PayPal,"" said Gallippi.  Jeff Ownby, vice-president of marketing at Butterfly Labs, said his company was confident all along that BitPay would be able to process such a large transaction.  ""The $1m payment with bitcoin is only a down payment of a much larger institutional order for 28nm product, and is not related to 65nm production,"" he added.  Ownby went on to say Butterfly Labs has quadrupled its 65nm production in the last six weeks and has doubled its production staff.  ""Funds received for 28nm Monarch products are used for production of our 28nm Monarch cards only. We expect to begin delivery of Monarch cards in December,"" he concluded.  The latest update from Butterfly Labs was at the start of September when the company announced customers could transfer their orders to another person. Customers can do so using the classified ads section located at the top of every page of the forum for hardware sales.  Do you think Butterfly Labs will now speed up production?

42425095,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqwTh,1383049313,Bitcoin needs to advance to 'third wave' of startups and accept regulation,"The bitcoin industry still has some way to evolve and some ""adult supervision"" in the form of regulation is necessary to bring digital currencies to the mainstream - they were the main points of agreement between a panel featuring CoinDesk's own founder Shakil Khan, at TechCrunch's Disrupt Europe 2013 Conference in Berlin from October 26-29.  Although the panel's title was Is Bitcoin the new Euro? even chair Kim-Mai Cutler described the proposal as ""ridiculous"" and no real comparisons were made to the EU's beleaguered currency.  Joining Khan on the panel were investor Michael Jackson of Mangrove Capital and Nejc Kodrič, co-founder and CEO of popular bitcoin exchange Bitstamp.  There were few disagreements between panelists. Both Khan and Jackson admitted that, while both are excited about bitcoin's future potential, neither have invested heavily just yet.  As well as starting CoinDesk in May 2013, Khan said that he has invested in BitPay and is holding a number of coins himself.  ""I have looked at probably most bitcoin companies and I've passed on investing,"" he said.  ""If you look at the waves of bitcoin companies that've been coming up, so far there have been some great ideas and some great idealists who want to run these companies. I've yet to find somebody who understood the deep technology. The opportunity, the bullishness about bitcoin, but who also knows what a P&L, a balance sheet is, and how to run a business.""  ""Hope is not a strategy and most bitcoin companies out there right now are relying on hope, not on a business plan.""  Bitcoin companies were all part of a three-wave or generation process. The first wave of bitcoin-related businesses has already been shut down, and some operators may even go to jail. The second generation is the current one, with Mt. Gox and upstarts arriving to challenge its dominance.  The third generation would arrive soon, said Khan, predicting Q1 next year or or even in the next couple of months. This wave would see the entry of serious and seasoned startup professionals, who have already experienced big companies and big exits.  ""I’m looking more forward to the next wave of companies. There are teams of entrepreneurs with tier A VCs, with lawyers, with regulators, sitting in rooms around the world, thinking how do we launch the next generation of digital currency companies. I think that’s where the opportunity is. We’re still very, very early in this journey.""  Kodrič agreed with the 'three-wave' view and his company's position in it, saying he started Bitstamp to overcome the hassles involved with wiring money to Japan and dealing with Mt. Gox as the only exchange option.  The importance of regulation  None of the panelists saw the unregulated, anarchic version of bitcoin as a realistic option heading into the future. Jackson said a clear knowledge of applicable laws and regulations would need to happen before large scale businesses got involved.  Right now, many large players on both the business and investment side were sitting back just waiting to see how it would all play out.  ""A lot of the bitcoin world so far has been 'we don't want any regulation, we don't want any of that stuff'. Just like a lot of the internet is, and unfortunately in the world of currency... in 2013, society expects traceability.""  It also needed to be much easier for everyday users to acquire bitcoins. Face-to-face transactions were sometimes easier than jumping through the ID and verification hoops of current exchanges (the panel was less clear on how customers would avoid these processes in a more regulated environment, though).  Jackson was also optimistic about regulators stepping in soon, saying although there was no current 'bitcoin hub' in Europe, most governments were quite curious about bitcoin and that the various jurisdictions of Europe provided an opportunity.  ""The good thing about Europe is we have 28 different countries with 28 different regulators. If you're in the European Union you only need one of them to open their eyes or begin to set these rules.""  He has recently been working with a regulator in Luxembourg who was interested but also just observing for now. Smaller countries, such as those in Scandinavia and Eastern Europe, ""generally tend to be a bit more pragmatic and easier to speak to with less vested interests.""  [post-quote]  Bitcoin, he said, was similar to the world of phone companies a decade or two ago, with traditional ways and the 'internet way' often clashing.  ""We are currently following the legacy regulation, which is not suitable for the technology that we are in. So we're eager to see what's going to happen on the regulatory front,"" added Kodrič.  Khan referred to some bitcoin businesses, such as BitInstant, suddenly replacing their services with ""a holding page saying 'We're working on some new features, we'll be back soon.' You wouldn't expect that from your bank.""  The panel touched briefly on China's first steps into bitcoin and internet giant Baidu's announcement it would start accepting bitcoin for some services.  ""Chinese television has been showing a number of short programs about bitcoin... and Chinese television is state run so we're seeing an education process taking place there,"" said Khan.  While Khan spoke casually of the bitcoin value going ""either to zero or lots of zeroes,"" Jackson said price stability was important to get merchants to accept the currency. Sellers don't want to be checking the exchanges every hour to re-set their prices, he added.  Although he doesn't invest in them personally, Khan said he saw a future where the adult and gambling industries once again led the way to mainstream acceptance.  ""I know for a fact they are looking into it.""  He also said large hedge funds were watching carefully: ""Some of the large hedge funds have got huge positions. They're not going to talk about it publicly.""  ""If you're a large fund and you've got 500 million or five billion in that fund, putting a million dollars into bitcoin is not the stupidest thing you can do. The upside potential is so huge and you've probably made your money by taking some form of risk and those risks were probably far higher than investing in bitcoin.""  The panel also predicted a future where bitcoin could be used almost invisibly for micropayments, facilitating transactions that delivered small amounts of money instantly without companies like Western Union taking a double-digit share in fees. In such a future, the value or name of bitcoin might not even be relevant, Khan said.

42425083,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqw9h,1383035933,UK bitcoin exchange Coinfloor opens for business,"A UK-based bitcoin exchange has beat competitors to the post as it opens for business today. London-based Coinfloor begins registering customers at 9am this morning.  The site, launched by Mark Lamb and Amadeo Pellicce, hopes to get in on the market early by offering GBP/BTC trading services before regulators have passed judgement on the cryptocurrency. It beats BitPrice to market. The latter has been lobbying regulators in the UK about bitcoin’s status, but hasn’t opened its doors yet.  Coinfloor, which is backed for an undisclosed sum by VC firm Passion Capital, is the first firm to trade bitcoins for GBP on an order book for at least a year. There are scant other exchanges in the UK trading bitcoins for GBP. Bittylicious offers the chance to buy bitcoins for sterling, for example, although this appears to be a more rudimentary site, and doesn’t have the charting facilities offered by Coinfloor. London-based Intersango ran an order book and allowed GBP trades, although that site inherited hacked and now-defunct virtual currency exchange Bitcoinica. It was sued by customers, and is no longer taking registrations.  “Historically the biggest hurdle for setting up a bitcoin exchange (whether in the UK or elsewhere, but even more so in the US) has been securing a banking partner,” said Stefan Glaenzer, a partner at Passion Capital. In 2012 Mt. Gox had to suspend GBP trading after its Barclays account was discontinued. It is possible to trade GBP for bitcoins on some other exchanges, but getting money out in GBP can involve a premium.  Coinfloor has secured multiple banking accounts from several different partners, he said. At least one of those is a Santander-owned bank, but neither the exchange nor the VC is saying who.  The other barrier to UK exchanges has been regulation. The UK Financial Conduct Authority (formerly the Financial Services Authority) and HMRC are so far not regulating bitcoin, but this creates uncertainty, and talks are ongoing.  “It's not for us to predict if they may change their view, but if they do, we will be prepared and ready to be compliant given our self-imposed procedures for KYC/AML,” said Glaenzer.  [post-quote]  The firm has also taken the precaution of excluding US users, to comply with KYC/AML rules that it says exceed compliance requirements for a regulated exchange. However, it hopes to open up trading to US users soon.  Coinfloor will offer straightforward trading services via an order book. There will be no margin trading available, but the firm is capitalizing on what it calls a sophisticated algorithmic rounding engine for fee calculation. Instead of simply rounding up its fees, it uses a form of stochastic rounding, which uses an algorithm to determine how a fee is rounded. This makes it suitable for high-frequency professional traders, it says.  Catering for pros will be one reason why the firm is offering maker-taker pricing for traders. To this end, the firm will also be offering ‘maker-taker’ pricing, which favours market makers.  In exchange trading, a market maker brings liquidity to an exchange by always being prepared to trade an asset. This stands in contrast to ‘takers’, who only come to an exchange with request to buy or sell when they are ready. Market makers are important because they make it easier for people to buy and sell an asset on an exchange without hoping that a suitable counterparty will turn up.  Market makers generally make their money via a ‘spread’, where they buy and sell at different prices to make a profit. But maker-taker pricing encourages market makers by giving them lower fees. If a trader places an order on Coinfloor that enables another party to make a trade, the trader is considered a maker, and will get lower fees. The other party, who takes advantage of that order, is taking liquidity out of the exchange. They are considered takers, and will be charged the taker rate.  Maker rates are up to 0.3% for those averaging £500 or less in trades over a 30-day period. Taker rates are 0.5%. These fall lower for higher-volume traders. For example, maker rates for 30-day averages between £55,000 and £88,000 are 0.03%, and taker rates are 0.28% at that level.  Coinfloor claims to the first bitcoin exchange to offer maker-taker pricing, but it won’t be the last. US-based exchange Coinsetter, which will focus on the USD/BTC currency pair, plans to offer maker-taker rates when it launches soon.  The maker-taker model encourages liquidity in a financial market, which is something that bitcoin sorely needs at present, and it is an example of how a new class of exchanges is becoming more sophisticated.  This model is attracting some sophisticated attention. Taavet Hinrikus, co-founder of low-cost currency exchange firm TransferWise and one of the first employees at Skype, also backed the firm.  Coinfloor begins taking account registrations today, but will begin trading on 5 November.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/29/uk-bitcoin-exchange-coinfloor-opens-for-business,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e17353955a4bf8676789f965a90f48ed4b01a81-1080x746.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
