Climbing 3.22% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $51,267.19-$54,032.05 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    What a dud: Friday’s record $6 billion expiry in the bitcoin options market turned to be a nonevent as prices for the largest cryptocurrency climbed steadily, with nary a glimpse of the feared plunge to the “max pain” point of $44,000.      For bitcoin bulls, the absence of action brought a measure of relief, with prices ticking up 4.8% on the day to about $53,800, allowing the 12-year-old digital asset to reclaim its losses from the past couple days.      With March coming to an end, one analyst said bitcoin should get “a nice tailwind” as hedge funds rebalance for quarterly reports or to manage risks.      “Both bitcoin and the S&P 500 have reached new all-time highs every month since December,” said Sean Rooney, head of research at Valkyrie Funds.      Such upward momentum could be limited. A widely tracked technical indicator, the monthly relative strength index (RSI), is signaling bitcoin is near an extreme overbought level.      “The RSI reading on the monthly chart is trading at extremely elevated levels,” Joel Kruger, cryptocurrency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk. It “suggests the market should see limited upside for now, with risk for correction and consolidation.”    Ether up, market debates Uniswap’s latest update    Ether (ETH) was up on Friday, trading around $1,665.85 and climbing 3.68% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      As ether’s price continues to move in tandem with bitcoin, market chatter was centered on Uniswap’s version 3, unveiled earlier this week.      Read More: Uniswap Unveils Version 3 in Bid to Stay DeFi’s Top Dog      Uniswap, the leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on Ethereum, announced another upgrade that will be launched on May 5. Uniswap v3, according to the firm behind the platform, will introduce a key change called “concentrated liquidity.”      While the new feature should give liquidity providers (LPs) more control over the price ranges in which they provide capital, there has been criticism that the changes might make it easier for retail liquidity providers to lose money, due to lack of experience.      Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner at Dragonfly Capital, has provided a detailed explanation of why Uniswap v3 would cause retail liquid providers to lose in this tweet thread.      The mixed messages and complexities sent by Uniswap v3 could hurt ether’s price, according to Denis Vinokourov, head of research for Trade The Chain. He pointed out that decentralized finance (DeFi) as a whole is “critical” to the Ethereum blockchain.      ""Uniswap has a lot more tokens listed than SushiSwap and it's the go-to avenue for liquidity bootstrapping,” Vinokourov said. “If this changes, and there is no market for them, ether that would otherwise be locked for LP reasons has to be absorbed somehow.

42434076,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7cvh,1616785864,Why Bitcoin Is a Better Risk Bet Than a Stack of Penny Stocks,"Bitcoin is getting boring at a time when annualized 30-day volatility as of Thursday's close has seen a sharp downward dip, in a March with its own type of (weather) volatility.      To emphasize the point, have a look at the chart above, which shows the volatility of bitcoin daily returns for the past month. To be fair, I'm employing a little chart crime here, starting the y axis at 40% in order to accentuate the drop between March 24-25, as all but the last days of February have disappeared from the 30-day look-back on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.      The boredom engendered by a tame month sparked a mild disagreement with ""First Mover"" show host Lawrence Lewitinn about penny stocks versus bitcoin. We were discussing the benefits of using indexes weighted either by price or by market cap. Price-weighted indexes can be more volatile because smaller-cap components can have a greater impact. I said a crypto index doesn't need more volatility because crypto assets already have the volatility of penny stocks.      Also read: Why Bitcoin Is More Like a $100 Bill Than Gold      Naturally, I had to go look up penny stocks and compare them to bitcoin's volatility. A penny stock refers to the stock of a small company that trades for less than $5 per share, sometimes on big exchanges but more often through over the counter (OTC) exchanges.      It turns out I may have been wrong, at least as far as bitcoin is concerned. On Wednesday, I grabbed a handful of penny stocks off the top of a list of ""hot penny stocks,"" ranked by 24-hour volume, provided by Barchart. These five stocks represent micro-cap companies, all in multimedia content or internet industries, all traded on the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. As you can see, when bitcoin is stacked against this grab bag of penny stocks, it tends to be less volatile than all of them except one.      Cinedigm Corp. (CIDM), a multimedia production company based in Los Angeles, is the only stock out of these five that's consistently less volatile than BTC. (You know it's a good investment when a web search of the ticker yields a page of penny-stock roundups that outrank the company's website itself.)      Volatility is a measure of risk, and that's often measured in relation to returns. And by that measure bitcoin is a beast so far this year. How does bitcoin compare with penny stocks on returns? The honey badger is running about the middle of this pack, it turns out, with some of these pennies outpacing it, including Cinedigm and Genius Brands International (GNUS), an L.A.-based multimedia producer.      Also read: ‘Altcoin Season’ Leaves Some Bitcoin Alternatives Frozen      As the chart above shows, if you'd bought these penny stocks at the close on Dec. 31 and held through Tuesday of this week, you'd be doing better than bitcoin holders over the same time period. But let's look at bitcoin against penny stocks over a longer term, using a measure that incorporates both returns and volatility.      This chart shows the monthly Sharpe ratio, annualized, for bitcoin against these penny stocks going back to July 2020. The Sharpe ratio is intended to capture returns relative to risk as measured by volatility. Specifically, excess daily log returns over the risk-free rate are averaged across the month, then divided by the standard deviation of daily log returns. That monthly figure is then annualized.      As you can see, despite lagging some of these penny stocks in year-to-date returns, and outpacing at least one of them in 30-day volatility of daily returns, bitcoin is in another category of risk-return over each month. And, with bitcoin volatility lower in the second half of 2020 than it has been so far in 2021, and the price running from around $10,000 to where it was today, you can imagine how much stronger that Sharpe ratio case is for the orange coin over the long term.

42434075,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7cth,1616784998,Elon Musk’s Bitcoin Marketing Coup,"Here’s some free advice for the Honda Motor Company: Market your cars to the newly bitcoin rich.      I’ve already got the ad copy for you.      A true bitcoiner is building for the future and deferring gratification. She doesn't blow her hard-earned savings on flashy toys. She prefers a solid, dependable family car.      And a slogan….      Lambos are for losers. HODLers drive Hondas.    Marc Hochstein, CoinDesk's executive editor, owns some bitcoin, and if he were smarter he'd have bought more years ago. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories on the future of money and Web 3.0. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    OK, so I’m no Don Draper. It's doubtful Honda or any other affordable carmaker would heed my suggestion any time soon. It's different for luxury electric vehicle maker Tesla, which doesn’t need to be told – it’s already doing something similar.    Diamond hands    This week, the manufacturer began accepting bitcoin (BTC) as payment for its cars, delivering on a promise made in early February by its impish chief executive, Elon Musk. Underscoring his faith in the currency, Musk declared on Wednesday that Tesla would keep rather than convert any bitcoin it earns from car sales.      Typically, the rare merchant that accepts crypto as payment for goods or services will swap it right away for U.S. dollars or another fiat currency. That’s understandable, given the price volatility and the low likelihood that a merchant’s suppliers would take magic internet money. But the Tesla chief said his company is HODLing.      For the uninitiated, HODLing is bitcoin slang for refusing to sell BTC, either to take profits in a bull market or to cut losses in a bear market. Based on a forum poster’s drunken misspelling of “hold,” the word broadly connotes a steely determination in the face of fear, uncertainty and doubt. A HODLer is someone who, to borrow from Rudyard Kipling, “can keep your head when all about you/Are losing theirs and blaming it on you.”      Musk clearly is one, in at least the narrow sense, having invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin for Tesla’s corporate treasury beginning this year. Over the last 12 months, the cryptocurrency’s price has soared nearly 700%, as inflation fears, a self-perpetuating hype cycle and possibly pandemic lockdown boredom spurred buying among individual and institutional investors. Like Tesla, for instance.      Yet, while I’m sure Musk would be happy to keep growing Tesla’s BTC stash one car sale at a time, I strongly suspect that isn’t his only or main motivation.      Rather, my gut is that the payment option is at least in part, if not primarily, a clever marketing maneuver.    Incentives to HODL    First off, there’s no indication Tesla is offering a discount to buyers who pay with bitcoin, which you might expect the company to do if its main goal were to acquire more of the stuff. Also, Tesla surely understands bitcoiners are strongly disincentivized to part with their “sats” (a loving nickname for the currency’s smallest unit, 0.00000001 BTC, in homage to creator, Satoshi Nakamoto).      This is partly for the reason I alluded to in my quixotic Honda pitch: Bitcoin is deflationary by design. There’s a set amount – 21 million BTC – that will ever be minted. Yet, as it grows in popularity, denominating things such as luxury cars in bitcoin ends up hurting the buyer over the long run.      While the price oscillates wildly from one minute to the next, if you zoom out the lens real wide, bitcoin has generally appreciated over time, which encourages saving (or “hoarding,” depending on your worldview). Remember that pizza purchased for 10,000 bitcoin in 2010? Ten thousand bitcoin is worth $500 million today. Hope the pizza tasted good.      Also, in the U.S. crypto is treated as property for tax purposes, which means that if you buy a coin for, say, $1 and it doubles in value and you spend that extra dollar on a cup of coffee, you are supposed to report the purchase to the Internal Revenue Service and pay tax on it. It remains to be seen whether Uncle Sam will go after every last Joe Schmoe who fails to report a piddling purchase. But it’s reasonable to assume anyone who uses crypto gains to buy a Tesla (which can run from $39,000 to $150,000) would show up on the taxman’s radar.      Even if a buyer can overcome those hurdles, Tesla isn’t making it easy. As CoinDesk’s Daniel Kuhn reported Thursday, when paying Tesla with bitcoin, a car buyer has “about 30 minutes” to complete the transaction or else the price in BTC expires and a new one must be requested. Also, Tesla will only accept exact amounts and will not reimburse payments sent to an incorrect address.      All told, even if you have large bags of bitcoin, it may make more sense to pay with fiat, whether for a Tesla or a tall latte.    Tribal signaling    Crypto is already obsessed with a car: the Lamborghini. But it's more of a joke than anything. Were Tesla to become the true status symbol in this industry, it could move the needle.      By embracing bitcoiner culture, Musk is likely to make more sales among that crowd than would happen otherwise, even if they’re settled in greenbacks. Any extra bitcoin Tesla picks up would be gravy.      In the Wednesday tweet, Musk also revealed Tesla is running its own node, rather than relying on a third party to tell it what's happening on the Bitcoin network. This is considered a best practice for advanced users, but it’s also a signal to the tribe: I get it. I’m one of you. It’s closely associating the Tesla brand, and Musk’s, with the ethos of the sovereign individual that animates the crypto community, not least of all the bitcoin faithful.      Think of it as a weird 21st century twist on affinity marketing, but without any formal partnership like the one my college had with a credit card lender in the 1990s, which led to me getting up to my ears in debt from charging stuff I didn’t need and couldn’t afford. Gee thanks, alma mater; I wish bitcoin were around back then to set me straight.      There is also a less charitable interpretation of Musk’s messaging: That he’s trying to divert attention away from bad news for Tesla. As CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reported in February, the big coming-out party coincided with the revelation by Chinese officials that they were questioning Tesla about quality and safety issues. And this week’s bitcoin announcement conveniently happened right after reports that U.S. regulators are scrutinizing Tesla's autopilot technology.      If true, this explanation is not mutually exclusive with my hunch. Tesla HODLing bitcoin could be a cynical PR move and a marketing coup – and a sincere adoption of an innovation in the world of bits by an innovator in the world of atoms, all at the same time. Binary thinking is for fools.      It’s far from certain if the marketing ploy, if that’s what it is, will work. ""Not quite sure if anything sold yet in bitcoin,"" a Tesla representative told my colleague Thursday.      But for my money, it’s better than anything Madison Avenue could come up with.

In cryptocurrencies, investors have leaned into bitcoin (BTC) as a potential hedge against inflation, as governments and central banks around the world unleashed massive amounts of economic stimulus.      While a sharp slowdown in the money supply's expansion is expected over the coming months, the growth is expected to continue at a breakneck pace relative to historical norms, according to a new report by Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.    By May, the year-over-year growth rate in M2 money supply – perhaps the broadest gauge of the money supply – will fall dramatically, Shepherdson wrote Thursday in the report.  ""But this would leave it at about 13%, comparable to the fastest growth rates seen during periods of very high inflation in the past,"" wrote Shepherdson.  ""We reckon that the increase in M2 this year will be about $2.5 trillion to $3 trillion, depending on what happens to bank lending and bank purchases of Treasurys. This implies that M2 will rise by some 13% to 16% in the year to December.""  “The current spike in M2 growth will not be reversed, even after the economy recovers. Central banks everywhere are terrified of outright declines in the nominal money supply, because they are rare and are associated with depressions.”  He added, ""Nothing like this has ever happened before.""    “The question then becomes, how far does inflation rise, and how quickly does it increase? [Federal Reserve] officials are confident in their ability to deal with rising inflation, but their tools have not been tested since the early 1980s.

42434072,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7cnh,1616781872,Money Reimagined: NFTs Can Learn From DeFi's Growth,"This week, you could be forgiven for thinking bitcoin has ceded ground at the epicenter of the crypto zeitgeist to non-fungible tokens (NFT). Bitcoin’s price dropped to its lowest level since March 8, after failing to consolidate gains made on yet another Elon Musk tweet. Meanwhile, NFT stories were everywhere again. Another Beeple art piece sold for $6 million to raise funds for the Open Earth Foundation’s efforts to fight climate change, and both The New York Times and Time Magazine announced sales of their own NFTs.      At the same time, it’s rather indisputable that NFTs are in a bubble. The question, asked by this week’s column, is where their real value might be found once that bursts.      It’s also true that bitcoin continues to attract attention in financial troubled parts of the world. There was a spike of interest in Turkey this week as its financial crisis worsened after President Recep Erdoğan got rid of his third central bank governor in less than two years. And there continues to be strong demand for bitcoin in Argentina, the country whose century-long troubles with money are the subject of this week’s edition of our “Money Reimagined” podcast.      We were joined by Lucas Llach, a former vice president of the Central Bank of Argentina, and by Santiago Siri, an Argentine-born crypto developer whose experiences there led him to invent an entirely new, decentralized approach to democracy. Have a listen after you read the newsletter.    NFTs’ Post-Frenzy Future Lies in DeFi    In a recent CoinDesk TV interview, entrepreneur and digital economy maven Gary Vaynerchuk looked at the current mania around non-fungible tokens, with the mind-blowing prices being paid for tokenized digital artifacts, and compared it to the 2000 dot.com bubble.      “Gary Vee,” whose utterances have earned him an Instagram following of 8 million and who will be a keynote at CoinDesk’s Consensus conference in May, meant it as a positive analogy, not a negative reference. Once NFT prices correct to more reasonable levels, he said, it will clear the way for the technology’s true transformative phase, much like the emergence of life-changing social media and mobile computing innovations in wake of the dot.com bust.

Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    The question, then, is what’s coming after the hype around NFT deflates?      To explore that, let’s add another, more recent historical comparison: the initial coin offering (ICO) bubble of 2017 and the decentralized finance (DeFi) boom that started last year. That two-step evolution was similar to the internet’s post-dot.com development, but in this case it’s with decentralized, blockchain technologies especially relevant to NFTs.    Integration and composability     The basic dot.com business model during the Web 1.0 era was to convince consumers they should buy their pet food or their socks or their groceries from different e-commerce websites. The problem was each site was easily replicable, which made for a brutal competition in which there could be only a few winners; or, perhaps just one: Amazon.      In the subsequent Web 2.0 phase, developers discovered the real opportunity lay in integrating with other internet applications and services to build audiences through enhanced network effects. We saw an explosion of apps built on the iPhone and Android operating systems, as well as services that tapped Facebook’s and Google’s APIs. The apps and platforms forged symbiotic relationships that expanded the combined ecosystems’ impact, utility and value.      Similarly, DeFi represented a break from the ICO model that preceded it. Whereas the unproven token projects of the ICO boom were mostly standalone ideas with self-contained value propositions, the defining features of DeFi are interoperability and “composability.”      DeFi projects that incentivize participants to add liquidity to decentralized lending markets proactively encourage cross-integration with different protocols and applications, literally building on top of one another. They leverage the value generated by each to grow a wider lending, borrowing and payments ecosystem out of a network of decentralized exchanges, automated market-makers, self-executing collateral systems, trustless price data and stablecoins.      DeFi must overcome scaling and usability challenges before it can fulfill its promise as an alternative, decentralized financial system. But there are already strong lessons to draw from the breathtaking pace of innovation.      For NFT projects, a big one may be that they, too, must integrate with other elements of the open-source, blockchain, fintech and data economy if they’re to add meaningful value to the creative, media and entertainment industry.    Speculation as a service    A second lesson is that speculation, too often derided as a source of excess and scammy behavior, can be your friend. It just needs to serve the project’s objective.      That was not the case for most ICOs. They were built on “utility token” models whereby the underlying ecosystem was projected to grow as users exchanged a programmable token whose features were supposed to incentivize them to act in the common interest. The problem was that investors saw the tokens as get-rich-quick opportunities, as assets to buy and hold in the hope of price appreciation, not as something to exchange and use. There was a conflict between user motivation and intended outcomes.      By contrast, DeFi projects need speculators. Many of the key DeFi components work on the principle that, when traders in financial products seek to profit from market inefficiencies, their buying or selling behaviors will drive prices back toward equilibrium. In effect, speculators profit by removing the inefficiencies and DeFi seeks to harness that.      Thus, MakerDAO’s decentralized platform automatically tweaks fees and collateral requirements to incentivize the profit-seeking actions of borrowers and lenders in ways that achieve one of the platform’s main objectives: to maintain a steady $1 price for dai, the stablecoin in which loans are denominated. Similarly, other DeFi lending platforms have offered special rewards to borrowers and lenders to entice the liquidity they need to grow their platforms.      What about the NFT market? Well, there’s plenty of speculation. But with headlines dominated by a few blowout deals, it might be doing more harm than good.      NFT proponents talk of democratizing arts and entertainment, of empowering up-and-coming artists and independent content creators, and of using this technology to raise money for worthy causes. In theory, the technology could give creators access to a wider potential market and encourage greater transparency to prevent powerful collectors and galleries from setting prices. It might also allow programmable features that automatically deliver some of the secondary market’s proceeds to the original artist or to designated recipients.      But it’s hard to speak of revolution if most of the value is captured by a few celebrity creators – like Beeple, whose $69 million sale was orchestrated by no less of an old-world art market player as Christie’s, or like Jack Dorsey, whose NFT of his first tweet fetched $2.9 million. As with the traditional art market, these high-priced unique assets will likely not find much liquidity in secondary sales by themselves, which means the market itself won’t grow, which in turn won’t help lesser-known artists.      So, again, it’s time to take a leaf out of DeFi’s book. How do you create useful speculation that fosters adoption and innovation?    DeFi-ing NFTs    The answer may lie not only in copying DeFi, but in joining it.      Integrating NFT minting platforms and marketplaces into DeFi’s network of decentralized exchanges and liquidity engines would allow developers of those projects to tap into that ecosystem of self-reinforcing innovation and access its liquidity pools to harness speculation in a constructive way.      A key opportunity lies in the innovative, smart contract-driven approach to collateral management employed by DeFi lending platforms such as Compound, Aave and MakerDAO. After all, art works and collectibles are quite often used as security for loans in the physical world, even when there’s not an especially liquid market for buying and selling them.      Already, startups such as NFTfi are working on a model that enables NFT holders to borrow against their assets in this way.      Meanwhile, if DeFi-based decentralized apps can both incentivize trading of NFTs and automate residual payments to the original creator’s chosen causes whenever a secondary market sale occurs, other radical business ideas might also be possible. In that widening, more diversified market, independent creators of art and other content will find new opportunities to monetize their work, especially if lightweight licensing and copyright solutions can be incorporated.      The good news is that, per this piece by CoinDesk’s Brady Dale, there are quite a number of teams in addition to NFTfi working at the nexus of DeFi and NFTs. The projects do everything from fractionalizing art ownership to creating more sophisticated, automated royalty payment systems.      The post-bubble NFT world might not be as headline-grabbing, but it promises to be more interesting.    Off the charts: The centralizing canal    In the parlance of hackers and crypto people, the Suez Canal is a centralized vector of attack, a single vulnerability that, if it fails, can do great harm to the much bigger system that depends on it. That’s the read of the economic impact of this week’s unfortunate incident in which a massive container ship ran aground in the canal and blocked traffic there for days. Lloyd’s of London estimated that $9.6 billion in goods shipments per day was being stalled by the blockage.      To put this centralized vulnerability into perspective, Shuai Hao and I came up with pie charts to represent the Suez Canal’s place within the global economy. The most significant measure is in dollar value, which may be a function of the fact that a great deal of the world’s oil passes through the canal.      That leads to another point: One decentralizing solution that would reduce the global economy’s dependence on this thoroughfare would be to shift more of the world’s energy consumption to local, renewable sources such as solar and wind. Read last week’s newsletter for a discussion of how bitcoin mining, counterintuitively, could be a catalyst for that.    The conversation: Musk strikes again (and misses?)    Another week, another tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk moves the crypto market. This time it was a remark, in the early hours New York time Wednesday, that Tesla is now accepting bitcoin for purchases of its cars.      The important aspect of the policy shift from Tesla was not that the company is accepting bitcoin payments per se but that it is managing the funds itself and won’t convert them into dollars. That “HODLing” part could, in theory, support the price.      Naturally, the usual cast of Tesla and bitcoin enthusiasts weighed in to applaud the move. And, sure enough, over the course of the next five hours, the news helped the largest cryptocurrency add around $3,400, or 6.4%, to post an intraday high of $57,225.      But the gains were short-lived. Within just six hours, the price was back down below where it had been before Musk’s tweet. The failure to consolidate gains seemed to act as a weight on bitcoin, such that by early Thursday morning it had dropped to within just $458 of the $50,000 level.      Why the retreat? Perhaps because there was no there there. At this stage of the bitcoin cycle, people with enough bitcoins to spend on a Tesla are HODLing it, not spending. Maybe a few people will follow Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s lead and spend their coin on a Tesla. But it’s immaterial to the market. CoinDesk columnist JP Koning had a point:    Relevant reads: Money laundering watchdog    The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international alliance of financial regulators, is flexing its muscles toward the crypto industry. New guidance this week, reported by Ian Allison, shows the FATF has DeFi in its sights. It is also tweaking the wording around NFTs that could signal a tougher regulatory hurdle for companies involved in that space.      Moreover, it outlined a stricter line on the “Travel Rule,” which will require virtual asset service providers (VASPs) – i.e., custodial cryptocurrency exchanges – to track their customers’ transfers to self-custody wallets off-platform. This prompted a stern backlash from crypto regulation lobbyists such as Coin Center’s director of research, Peter Van Valkenburgh, who bemoaned the “absolutely inappropriate” surveillance of individuals that the changes would entail.      Undeterred, Rick McDonell, the former executive secretary of the FATF, penned an op-ed for CoinDesk essentially chastising the crypto industry for asking that it be given an easier regulatory standard than that applied to traditional financial institutions.      So, how are crypto businesses responding? The hiring moves by Binance, the global exchange powerhouse, provide a hint. As Danny Nelson reports, Binance has added former FATF officers to its regulatory strategy team.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Michael J.

Lee’s comments on the sustainability of cryptocurrency came at an event on Wednesday, Park Geun-mo reported for CoinDesk Korea.      “When the central bank-issued digital currency is introduced, the demand for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as means of payment will decrease,"" Lee said.      He also said bitcoin and other crypto assets have high price volatility and so there are limitations to how well they can function as a means of payment or as a store of value.      Lee’s comments come as the Bank of Korea prepares to pilot its own CBDC later this year. A number of countries around the world including China, Russia, Turkey and Jamaica have all announced potential CBDC pilots in 2021.      In South Korea’s pilot, the bank plans to test the CBDC for fund transfers, payments, issuance, distribution and redemption, according to CoinDesk Korea.      Bank of Korea also published research on a national digital currency in February, which concluded that CBDCs are like fiat currency and will meet the requirements for legal tender, as opposed to privately issued cryptocurrencies.      At Wednesday’s event Lee added, ""Prior to the circulation of a CBDC, there is a need for an inspection of technological requirements and an in-depth examination of the impact of a CBDC on the financial system.”      Last week, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made a similar comment, referring to a report from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Speaking at a Basel conference on virtual payments, Powell said a CBDC will need to “coexist with cash and other types of money in an innovative and flexible payment system.”      Lee has had to answer other questions about virtual currencies because of the bitcoin price run and South Korea’s upcoming CBDC pilot.      Last month, speaking to the National Assembly, Lee said cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have “no intrinsic value.” At a later event, Lee also said that when it comes to a CBDC, it’s better to follow the path of the U.S. and do it right rather than do it fast.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/26/cbdcs-will-reduce-demand-for-bitcoin-says-south-korea-central-bank-chief,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/848292e49f71c3d118acb70088a7521eaeca4496-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Two people familiar with the matter said the $3.9 billion Duke Endowment was included early on in the cap table of Coinbase, which is expected to command a price tag of around $100 billion when its shares debut on Nasdaq. Those shares are now worth a small fortune, on the order of nine figures, the sources said.      “The Duke University endowment has direct Coinbase exposure because Fred [Ehrsam] approached Duke for one of the early rounds,” said a source who was part of the venture capital community at that time. ""They probably 100x'd their money, after dilution. So even if they only put in $5 million, they just made $500 million, which is a lot for an endowment.”      Coinbase declined to comment. Duke Endowment did not immediately return requests for comment.    Read more: Coinbase Is Going Public: Everything You Need to Know    The VC veteran said it was most likely the 2015 Series C round in which Duke participated. CoinDesk was unable to confirm the exact size of the investment.      University endowments have long been seen as a leading indicator of the institutional stampede into crypto investing. While the Duke investment was at a remove from the assets themselves, the bet on what has become a key piece of market infrastructure appears to have paid off handsomely.    Coinbase cap table    In 2015, Coinbase raised $75 million as part of a Series C funding round backed by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), USAA, Spanish bank BBVA and Japanese telco DoCoMo. The exchange’s 2017 Series D round raised $100 million from Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), Battery Ventures, Draper Associates, Greylock Partners, Section 32 and Spark Capital.      “By virtue of having been successful in crypto, these early investors are now believers,” the VC source, who was not authorized to speak about the investment on the record, told CoinDesk. “It's like, ‘Hey, this thing actually worked.’ And so I suspect a lot of that money gets recycled back into crypto.”      Indeed, Duke’s approach may even be on the cautious side. In January, CoinDesk reported Ivy League colleges including Harvard and Yale had been buying cryptocurrency directly from Coinbase over the past year, prior to the current bull run.    Read more: Harvard, Yale, Brown Endowments Have Been Buying Bitcoin for at Least a Year: Sources    In the case of North Carolina-based Duke, crypto and blockchain have been in the blood of the college for quite some time. Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke’s Fuqua School of Business, teaches a course that now covers decentralized finance (DeFi).      Professor Harvey said Ehrsam was a recent speaker in his course; the star alumnus first came in and talked about Coinbase the first year Harvey ran the course back in 2014.      Harvey said he could not talk about the Duke endowment specifically, but said he has been a longtime advocate of investing in early-stage startups for university endowments.      “University endowments often have a very long time horizon, so it's not unusual to have a greater than average exposure to early stage ventures,” said Harvey. “They are looking for that 100x.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | ZRX,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/26/duke-universitys-early-coinbase-investment-could-now-be-worth-500m-sources,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c027f6ac76f7a2a5228fe383f27c56ea8778be67-1500x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386247,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSExH,1616771088,Staking as an Asset Class? This Swiss Institutional Fund Is Jumping In,"While institutional investors around the world are just getting their heads around bitcoin, asset managers in crypto-friendly Switzerland are heading into staking on next-generation blockchain networks.      Announced Friday, Zurich-based investment firm Tavis Digital has partnered with Singapore-based Persistence, a bridge for traditional firms into undiscovered realms such as token staking and decentralized finance (DeFi). Tavis Digital is a spin-off of Tavis Capital, an asset manager regulated by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) with about $1.07 billion in assets under management.      Nimble and financially sophisticated countries like Switzerland and Singapore are ahead of the pack when it comes to cryptocurrency and its applications.      “We white-label our services to institutional clients and stakeholders who do not know how to run a validator node both on the software side as well as on the hardware side,” said Tushar Aggarwal, CEO and co-founder of Persistence. “It’s not a trivial thing to run a validator node, you need almost close to 100% uptime otherwise you get slashed.”      Persistence enables investors to get staking rewards (akin to interest) by participating in proof-of-stake (PoS) networks such as Cosmos, Polygon (formerly Matic), NEAR, SKALE, Terra and others. The tie-up with Tavis is a demonstration that some traditional funds are going beyond merely adding bitcoin as an asset class.    Fresh fields    PoS systems eschew the Bitcoin blockchain’s energy-intensive method of ordering transactions so coins cannot be spent twice and propose to solve the “nothing at stake” problem by apportioning some skin in the game. Purchasing and holding tokens on a blockchain earns rewards for validating the order of transactions, but can result in losses (known as “slashing”) if a validating node goes offline or is unresponsive.    Read more: Indian Trade Finance Startup Raises $3.7M in Token Sale Led by Arrington XRP    Direct participation in staking networks and all the validation node husbandry that goes with it is a complex business, and Persistence provides a complete handholding for firms that don’t want to spend time and money setting up dedicated blockchain teams. This hosting service earns Persistence about 1% on the assets being staked. The firm has some $260 million in assets under delegation, mostly on Cosmos.      “With backdrop of most parts of western Europe now at 0% interest rates, or negative interest rates in certain jurisdictions, there is an increased demand from institutional folks to generate fixed income yields,” said Aggarwal, adding:    “And that's what Tavis Digital is trying to do – create this fixed income fund vehicle and generate returns from proof-of-stake mining as an asset class.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/26/staking-as-an-asset-class-this-swiss-institutional-fund-is-jumping-in,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fff0f5a38db4f9ddd3a2f76221eda7760d1ab628-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Series D raise values the New York firm at $2 billion and was led by Paradigm with participation by Addition Capital, Ribbit and Marc Benioff’s Time Ventures. It comes after November’s $100 million Series C at a $1 billion valuation. In six years Chainalysis has raised $266 million in total.      Chainalysis is among the largest U.S. cryptocurrency investigation firms building software to untangle messy blockchain transaction histories. Crypto transfer records are publicly available but difficult for laypersons to decipher without context, such as flagged wallet addresses and blacklisted coins.      That has turned into a multimillion-dollar business opportunity for Chainalysis. Government agencies use its products to bust bitcoin-linked crime rings while exchanges turn to it for help vetting and sometimes freezing stolen crypto. U.S. agencies are a particular cash cow: the FBI, Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other federal offices spent over $10 million on Chainalysis in 2020, according to records reviewed by CoinDesk.

Those offices, which opened amid COVID uncertainty, have so far been stymied by hiring woes, Gronager said.      A growing global rolodex spans government agencies in 30 countries and companies in 60, Chainalsysis said. It said its annual recurring revenue has more than doubled year over year, fueled in large part by a blistering six months of growth that coincided with bitcoin’s price boom.      Gronager said private-sector tie-ups continue to be a major source of new partnerships for Chainalysis while its government business, though “super solid,” remains stable. Financial institutions are also beginning to show interest, he hinted.      Onboarding new clients is an expensive proposition, Gronager said, and so the money will go toward building out that function.      “We are an enterprise sales company,” he said. “Every time we need to book another $1 or $2 million [in contracts] we need to hire another sales rep.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/26/chainalysis-raises-100m-underscoring-surging-demand-for-blockchain-surveillance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99252816ade906332f5514cd197b37bb965192d8-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Speaking at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) seminar on Thursday, Mu Changchun said Alipay and WeChat Pay together make up 98% of the mobile payments market, and one key reason the PBoC is developing its own digital yuan is to provide a “backup” payment option, according to a Bloomberg report.  Mu suggested if ""something bad"" were to happen to Alipay or WeChat Pay, financially or technically, it could have a ""negative impact"" on the stability of China's financial system.  In order to provide backup for the retail payment system, the central bank has to step up its own digital yuan.  China is leading other major nations in developing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), but the digital yuan project has raised concerns about the amount of insight it would give authorities into users’ financial data and behavior.  At the BIS seminar, the PBoC proposed a set of global rules for monitoring CBDCs and shared its proposals with other central banks and monetary authorities.  In February, a report emerged stating that MYbank and WeBank – institutions backed by Chinese giants Ant Group and Tencent, respectively – were set to join the ongoing trial of the digital yuan.

Called a Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP), the new GPU was launched earlier this year to target professional cryptocurrency miners. Nvidia introduced the GPU, in part, to steer those miners away from its other GPUs following complaints by the company's core gaming customers frustrated by shortages caused by miner demand.      In the company's Q4 earnings call, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said she expected about $50 million in total CMP sales during the new product's first quarter this year, per CoinDesk's prior reporting. Hut 8 filled 60% of that target in one order.      The machines ""open up new opportunities"" for Hut 8's plans for diversified revenue streams, said CEO Jamie Leverton in a statement. The new CMPs will add roughly 1,600 GH of power to the firm's mining capacity, which it will use to mine alternate blockchains. Hut 8 expects full delivery and deployment of the CMPs this summer.      Allocating mining capacity to alternate blockchains like Ethereum ""has been rewarded handsomely by public market investors as seen by the stock price of Hive compared to [its] Canadian-traded counterparts who have focused on Bitcoin to date,"" said Ethan Vera, co-founder of Seattle-based mining company Luxor Technology, in a direct message with CoinDesk. Now Hut 8 wants some of the profit.      Shares of the Toronto-based company have gained 130% year to date to just above $7. Bitcoin has climbed 77% over the same period.

It will provide a platform for cryptocurrency miners to produce bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a sustainable way, the firms said.  The agreement comes amid rising criticism for the energy used by the crypto mining industry and its potential impact on climate change.  ""Addressing climate change is a priority for Argo and partnering with DMG to create the first 'green' bitcoin mining pool is an important step towards protecting our planet now and for generations to come,” said Peter Wall, CEO of Argo Blockchain.
