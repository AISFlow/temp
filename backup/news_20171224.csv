42428331,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7Gdh,1514134834,My Advice for ICOs? I'm Sorry I Was Right…,"Jason Seibert, esq. leads a small law practice focusing on securities fraud, transactions and fiduciary duties, and host of the ""I'm Not Your Lawyer"" podcast.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      Since 2015, people have asked me what I think about all kinds of things in the crypto-securities world.  After working on the SEC v. Shavers case, I had the opportunity to speak at several locations, and to consult with a lot of businesses. Each time, I would calmly explain that initial coin offerings, so-called ICOs, were securities offerings.  The response would range from outrage to unmeasured vitriol.  I recall speaking in Las Vegas at a conference put on by Oracle. There, I answered questions from the audience, and later in the hallway a man who helped found ethereum, came up to me and said something along the lines of, ""Dude, what's your deal, are you a fed or something?"" My answer was simply, ""No. I just don’t want everyone to be surprised when regulation comes down hard.""  His response, ""Well, they haven't done anything yet, so that means they aren't going to, right?"" ""No,"" I replied simply.  The discussion that followed was the same one I've had with many over the past couple years. They have to believe that they've found the magic secret to get around law and regulation. That the ultimate ""AH HA!!!"" happened is a dream has haunted many companies I’ve spoken with.  I simply reply that:  ""The government is patient. The government has rules and regulations and unions. The government is not comprised of caffeinated coders that work 100 hours in two days whilst flaming newbs in chatrooms. The government has a process, and that process must be followed.""  Hear ye, hear ye  As The DAO was contemplated, I recall, specifically, having a phone call with a prominent New York bitcoiner who was gloating that The DAO had solved the Howey Test and that regulators were finally out of crypto.  I disagreed, explained horizontal and vertical commonality, and noted that under several cases, including my personal favorite, SEC v. Glenn Turner, these were securities. There was nothing but laughter on the other end of the phone.  *Sigh.* Then The DAO imploded.  In January 2017, I attended The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC) and sat on a legal panel with Drew Vander Hink and Adella Toulon-Foerster in the bathroom hosted by Chris DeRose and Junseth (then Bitcoin Uncensored) and moderated by Tone Vays.  I must have sat on three or four panels that weekend on the air, and figured out that through a show I could reach more people and give them the advice they NEEDED – not the advice they wanted. I started with Charlie Shrem and that ridiculous Jason Granger Mainstreet Investment and didn’t look back.  I dedicated about an hour each week to breaking down ICOs and explaining how they violated securities laws or how the terms and agreements were scams.  I did it all for free as pro-bono work for the industry. … doing ""God's work"" as Marco Santori once commented to me about my efforts with Shavers.  Having my cake and eating it  Then, it happened, July 25, 2017. SEC Release 81207 – Report of Investigation Pursuant to 21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO. (*note – the SEC spent nearly two pages discussing how SEC v. Glen Turner applied)  I went on the air that night and started taking calls and having discussions with various luminaries in the bitcoin world. Rhiana came home from the store while I was on the air and walked into my tiny home office carrying a cake.  On the top of the cake it read, ""I'm Sorry I was Right.""  I laughed so hard I had to take a break. I then ate cake for the next two hours live on the air. I ended the show with my usual closing, ""I'm not your lawyer, but I could be…""  Since that date, I've advised dozens of ICOs on proper formation of utility and software tokens and am defending an SEC inquiry into an ICO from last year.  I've worked with clients all over the world. I've advised legislators, drafted proposed regulations, spoken with prime ministers and visited countries I honestly didn’t know existed. It's been a hell of a ride.  Not full yet  I-told-you-sos aside, you may be wondering where ICOs go from here.  Hard to say. I’d like to see legitimate offerings taking advantage of the quick and easy systems set up by regulators, but it seems more often than not, ICOs want to skirt regulation and dare the SEC to come after them. That's not the best way to go.  I think part of the limitation of legitimacy is that there are very few markets in existence or on the horizon where security tokens can be traded, and using those exchanges means having to identify yourself as an investor.  The anonymous nature of crypto also works against compliance.  I think, as I suggested many times over the past year, if the industry regulated itself, if the exchanges actually had requirements for listing (other than whether or not the coin can pay the listing fee) – like some form of diligence and verification of legitimacy – we might move in the right direction.  But, in my opinion, so long as there are venues for trading ICO coins, there will be less incentive for the related projects to use a registered and compliant exchange.  I hope to be wrong.

42428342,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7Gvh,1514122223,2017: The Year Blockchain Got Weird,"Sarah Friend (@isthisanart_) is a software engineer working at a blockchain development studio. When not doing that, she creates games and interactive experiences that explore privacy and transparency and the political and environmental implications of technology.  This article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review opinion series.      2017 was a lot of things – a year of unprecedented environmental catastrophe, an ongoing political trash fire, the year that made more crypto-millionaires than any year previous…  Another way to remember the past year is calling it ""the year weird blockchain broke."" But what is weird blockchain you might ask? The etymology comes the ""weird Facebook"" phenomenon, a collection of meme-pages, wholesome and less-wholesome trolls and pseudonymous profiles made all the more wonderful by their unlikely home, the social network your family and your boss use.  And maybe in that definition, I point to why weird blockchain is worth talking about now, at the end of 2017 – because finally, weird blockchain feels weird.  The blockchain community has always been prolific with in-jokes and memes. Early crypto adopters share a vernacular of signs, symbols and idiosyncrasies – from yelling ""MOON"" in trollboxes, to HODLing, to the entire existence of dogecoin at all in any capacity.    But this year, blockchain hit banks, it hit business, it hit $10,000, and in its success it welcomed the masses like never before.    In the early days of crypto, anyone staying up all night to trade (or spending months of their life writing software no one thought would be useful) crossed the bridge of self-selection into the land of the outsider. This is no longer the case.  Now, in no particular order – my faves of the year's absurdity:  Jokes as art  Useless tokens of all kinds, among them the eponymous ""Useless Ethereum Token.""  UET bills itself as ""The world's first 100 percent honest ethereum ICO,"" raising 310.445 ether. This one's basically a meme blockbuster, culminating in a listing on HitBTC and at one point trading at $4.95. Yet, it also had an early and less-well-known predecessor, ponzIco, a more biting variant, hatched by Josh Cincinnatti of the zcash foundation.  It comes with a pun-filled whitepaper, and was name dropped by Matt Levine on Money Stuff:  ""The great art project of our age is to entirely collapse the distinctions between 'fraud' and 'performance art,' so that one day mortgage-bond traders will be able to say, 'Wait, no, I wasn't lying about bond prices to increase my bonus, I was performing a metafictional narrative about bond-price negotiations in order to problematize the underlying foundations of bond trading in late capitalism.'""  Memes live in the liminal space between art and jokes.  A troll of a different variety is Fluffypony (Riccardo Spagni), the lead developer for monero, whose hype campaign for a ""big announcement"" in May 2017 culminated in a 2x run-up in price.  When the video finally dropped, it was instead a two-minute long stock-footage filled parody of inspirational corporate propaganda, culminating in the slogan, ""Putting the fun back in fungibility.""  Hailed as art by some and with outrage by others:    The moment when a cypherpunk developer became an artist. Best performance art ever. ❤️#Monero https://t.co/JGcV9g5EJm        — YT (@coin_artist) May 24, 2017      In this genre, I award honorable mentions to BTCwizard, world's first ""Initial Troll Offering"" (a push to get the bitcoin wizard a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal) and FitVitalik, an apparently totally  sincere token that will somehow get Vitalik Buterin a probably-non-consensual personal trainer.  Art as jokes  Moving more squarely towards the camp of what I’ll call ""intentional art,"" we find Bad Shibe written by Rob Myers and illustrated by Lina Theodorou.  The story is a near-future sci-fi novella set under a rising Doge Moon – a young shibe named YS starts to question the underpinnings of the tokenized-reputation system that governs their world. Written in 2014, but only now published in 2017, the meme is still strong – and the story more relevant than ever.  Bad Shibe is part of Artists Re:Thinking the Blockchain, an anthology of speculative fiction, interviews, illustrations and theory published by Furtherfield, a centre for arts and technology based in the U.K.  The book includes a rich collection of takes … everything from a round up of cryptocurrency mining in contemporary art, a blockchain developer’s Hippocratic oath and blockchain LARP. Furtherfield has also been hosting the DAOWO programme – a series of workshops on reinventing the arts lab with blockchain.  Another irreverent project with a postwork dystopian twist, Max Dovey’s Respiratory Miner allows people to mine cryptocurrency by breathing.  Breath (BRH) is part of an art performance and interactive exhibit that uses a spirometry, a medical technique for measuring lung capacity, to mine monero with a hashrate adjusted for rate-of- breath. It was recently exhibited at Generator Projects in Dundee in an exhibition curated by Alejandro Ball and Inês Costa, and will be exhibited again in January as part of Money Lab 2018.  Truth is stranger  But of course, another dimension of the fake news era is – beyond the blurry synergy of jokes-as- art and art-as- jokes – is reality itself competing to out-weird them.  How can you distinguish the troll from the truth? As we all now know it’s a sinister phenomenon, but its smallest sibling is the clickbait headline that becomes accidental meme.
