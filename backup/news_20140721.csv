42425908,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh1bh,1405982445,Stripe: Bitcoin Has Future in Global Payments if Issues Solved,"San Francicso-based Stripe, a company that offers API-based payment systems, has published a blog post examining how it expects the bitcoin market to develop.  Titled ""Bitcoin: The Stripe Perspective"", the article examines what the company believes it may take for mainstream consumer adoption of digital currency to ignite.  The blog post explores bitcoin's possible use as a financial solution in nations with high-inflation currencies, as well as the technology's role in global payments infrastructure. Though largely positive in its conclusions, the company said that consumer protections remain a major unresolved barrier for bitcoin.  Despite potential obstacles to broader adoption, however, Stripe posits that digital currency and the underlying technology could be a valuable tool in solving some of the key challenges in payments today.  Although notable, this is not the first time Stripe has addressed digital currency. In March, Stripe announced that it would begin testing bitcoin payment support and, in June, CTO Greg Brockman said that bitcoin could one day unite the different worlds of finance.  To date, the company has raised over $120m from venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Khosla Ventures and Sequoia Capital.  Purpose enables adoption  The post, which was authored by Brockman, indicates that, for the time being, most people in countries with strong fiat currencies have little incentive to switch to bitcoin. Yet, by identifying novel – and practical – use cases for bitcoin, the technology may catch on throughout the world, he said.  ""Consumers mostly want a safe place to hold their savings, and the existing bank account insurances and consumer protections [in stable currency countries] have set a high bar,"" he wrote.  However, as Stripe suggests, there is a huge upside for countries whose economies are plagued by inflationary problems, such as Argentina, Venezuela and Iran.  Citizens of countries that must use high-inflation currencies have an incentive to find more stable monies. Stripe sees bitcoin as a possible tool in situations like this, owing to the digital currency's international profile.  Despite bitcoin's reputation for being volatile, some fiat currencies like the Argentine peso are even more erratic. These fluctuations can hurt long-term usage for unstable currencies – and boost the potential value of using bitcoin, the post reasons.  Additionally, digital currency can help dissolve antiquated border and capital control issues. According to Stripe, bitcoin presents a chance to rejuvenate the world's payments infrastructure.  The post notes:    ""Traditional payment systems look a lot like computer networks before the Internet. Cryptocurrencies have given us a real opportunity to solve these problems.""            Access via gateways  Stripe believes that the best way for people to be introduced to bitcoin is through gateways that specialize in digital currency.  Gateways, in theory, would be operated by financial companies such as payment processors, and these companies would be responsible for handling some of the consumer protection and legal issues related to bitcoin.  This proposal is similar to a system currently in use by Ripple Labs, which aims to allow third parties like banks to connect to its payments and smart assets protocol with what it also calls gateways.  However, the post cautions that gateways won't likely prove to be the real igniter of digital currency. Stripe noted that Ripple Labs and another alternative called Open Transactions have ""failed to win the necessary user support"" that would lead to broader adoption.  Bitcoin in the broader market  Comparing bitcoin to current payment processors such as Visa, Stripe believes digital currency offers a worthwhile way to move money and a system for validation built upon a set of rules. The combination of cryptography and decentralized transaction certification infrastructure represents a novel concept that has not yet been integrated with major payment networks.  In the end, though, it is Stripe's opinion that bitcoin fundamentally so far lacks the proper consumer protections that would make it a viable competitor to companies like Visa.  The post states:  ""Unless we solve decentralized reputation, the bitcoin ecosystem will see the emergence of a few centralized consumer 'trust providers'.""  Brockman is still upbeat about the future for bitcoin, however, rounding off the post with the words:  ""We’re still in the very early days, but we can already start to see the shape of the potential impact of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. If we get things right, life is going to be much better for billions of people.""

42425905,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh1Xh,1405978219,Ripple Labs Unveils Proposal for New Smart Contract System,"San Francisco-based Ripple Labs, a startup focused on building payment and digital asset networks, has unveiled a comprehensive plan for the development of a new smart contract system.  Called Codius, the proposed system will be programming language agnostic and work with existing monetary and contractual systems.  There are a few cryptographic projects currently seeking to build smart contract solutions, but Codius is perhaps the framework that many in the cryptocurrency space have been seeking to leverage to build asset structures.  Stefan Thomas, chief technology officer at Ripple Labs, told CoinDesk that programmable contracts in digital form will be ubiquitous someday - and that the company wants to be a steward for this technology.  Thomas said:  ""[Smart] contract logic decides who should receive the money. It can query any internet server to do so, including crypto networks, web services, etc. Based on the decision, the contract hosts will allow a transaction sending the money to that recipient to succeed.""  Smart oracles  As detailed in a blog post and whitepaper on GitHub, the Ripple Labs plan for Codius is ambitious, building off of researcher Nick Szabo's early work in programmable methods of contract law.  It relies on the use of what is known as an oracle, which is an instance that can sign a cryptographic key pair if or when a condition is met, hence the concept of a ""smart"" contract that can execute itself when it has proper inputs.  ""Oracles sign things and the signatures trigger actions in the distributed networks,"" Thomas explained.  The Codius project calls these ""smart oracles"", in the sense that they will be able to operate on an untrusted codebase. This means that there will be open access to this project for most developers since it will not require the use of a specific programming language.  Thomas explained:  ""Compared to conventional oracles [such as for bitcoin], smart oracles don't require you to learn how to write code for the deterministic environments. You can write regular JavaScript, or any other language that somebody has ported to Codius and treat bitcoin as if it was your database.""  Smart oracles handle the sandboxing, identification and even hosting of these digital assets. Furthermore, the system will be able to integrate with a number of different systems of value: bitcoin, Ripple's XRP or even fiat money.  The smart contract economy  Ripple Labs believes an entire industry will be built around smart digital assets - just like what is happening in the cryptocurrency realm. One of the earliest business ventures to coincide with the creation of smart contracts might be hosting platforms for the technology.  ""You run somebody's code and they pay you for it. I could see hosting companies starting to add contracts offerings,"" said Thomas. ""Hosting VMs [virtual machines] is a very similar business model.""  The bitcoin mining sector might find value in getting into the smart contract business as well.  Generating new coins is profitable in bitcoin right now, but this may not be the case in the future for some mining operations. In addition to earning revenue for confirming transactions, miners may find that hosting smart contracts is another lucrative venture down the road.  Said Thomas:  ""Essentially miners are performing a validation function for the network in exchange for a reward, again a very similar concept as running a Codius host and being paid for running contracts.""  Legal ramifications  The use of smart contracts could solve not only the antiquated problems of using paper for legal purposes, it could also make legal systems around the globe more efficient.  Greg Kidd is Ripple Labs' chief risk operator, who worked at Promontory Financial Group prior to joining the company. He told CoinDesk:  ""We see smart contracts as a layer between the contracting parties and the legal system. Right now, if anything goes wrong with a contract, you have to go to the legal system, which is extremely slow and expensive.""  Companies spend billions of dollars every year on various legal costs. Smart contracts might not be a solution for any sort of disputed situation. But Kidd, who also previously worked with the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve, thinks that the technology has promise to improve the broader legal system.  ""If you can write smart contracts that handle 50% of the possible ways that a given contract can go wrong, you can save 50% of the expected legal fees from entering the contract,"" he said.  Development continues  There are already a few different cryptographic smart contract projects in various stages of development, with perhaps the most notable being Vitalik Buterin's still unreleased Ethereum.  Colored coins, which act as a token on top of bitcoin, are also still in development. That effort has seen little industry traction so far, but a company called Coinprism is still trying to advocate its use.  ""I'm waiting for an actual implementation. We are very excited about the opportunities arising out of smart contracts and other block chain technologies, but it's early days,"" said Fabio Federici, whose startup Coinalytics analyzes block chain data for its clients.  Nevertheless, the Codius white paper and its proposed use of Google's Native Client to execute a small and relatively secure base of code is novel. The applications Ripple Labs envisions for the Codius project are numerous. The list include tools that cover voting, escrow, derivatives, auctions, property and the equities markets.  In essence, smart contracts have the capability of innovating lawful agreements in the same way cryptocurrenies are changing existing concepts of money and value exchange.  Kidd added:  ""We're interested in making antiquated systems such as payments and legal vastly more efficient and democratic using distributed technology. Codius improves and opens access to the process of creating and executing legal agreements, so lawyers, judges, etc. can focus their energies on more complex cases.""

42425903,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh1Rh,1405973409,Dell: Bitcoin Aligns Our Brand With Innovation,"Texas-based computer technology giant Dell became the largest merchant to join the bitcoin ecosystem late last week when it announced a partnership with Coinbase and launched a 10% discount for bitcoin customers.  The news was greeted with applause by the bitcoin ecosystem and proliferated widely through the mainstream media given Dell's strong brand recognition and status as an early success story from the PC computing era.  Now, speaking to CoinDesk in a new interview, Paul Walsh, CIO of Dell Commerce Services, has provided more insight into his company's decision to begin accepting bitcoin payments, a first of what he acknowledged could become his company's more extensive involvement in the space.  Perhaps most notably, Walsh indicated that Dell doesn't consider itself to be an early adopter of bitcoin. Rather, he suggested that Dell believes merchants are already broadly moving toward accepting digital currency as a payment option, and that the decision simply finds Dell keeping pace with the times and the needs of its existing customers.  Walsh told CoinDesk:  ""We've got to ensure we know where the market is going and what's happening everywhere. We have regular communication with our customers, we understand exactly what they're looking for [and] where they may have friction in their path, we look to see if there are any big innovations that would benefit our customers.""  Dell became the largest public company to go private last year when original founder Michael Dell closed a $25bn deal to regain its leadership.  According to the company's last public filing, it earned $56.9bn in 2013, with the largest gain in revenue increase in its enterprise solutions and services business.  Improving customer service  For now, Walsh said the company's main goal for its bitcoin program will be to remove friction during the customer purchasing process and make it easier for its existing customer base to transact with Dell.  Walsh suggested that Dell believes many of its existing customers already use bitcoin, and that the partnership with Coinbase simply allows the company to better serve these customers.  ""I think that customer feedback was one of the reasons we started doing it. That to me says that our existing customers have been using bitcoin, so we want to make sure we're satisfying those,"" Walsh said.  His comments also suggest that Dell believes bitcoin to be a payment method on par with other, more widely used tools, as he added:  ""We provide whatever payment offerings you need, whether it be your credit card or PayPal and now with bitcoin, we're just trying to answer to customer demand.""  Extending services globally  Embracing a similar model as online travel booking giant Expedia and electronics retailer TigerDirect, Walsh confirmed Dell will initially trial bitcoin payments with only US-based customers.  However, Walsh suggested that his company is open to expanding the program, though he did not provide details about any proposals that may be in the works or what metrics Dell will evaluate before coming to this decision.  Walsh explained:  ""We wanted to start up with the US base, and from that, we'll see where we wanted to move next. The big thing here is being able to be a lot more agile in terms of addressing our customers' needs.""  Emphasizing innovation  Walsh also framed the decision as one that would help return Dell to its roots as an innovator in technology. Throughout the conversation, Walsh emphasized how it is prioritizing innovation, and how bitcoin simply provided the latest way that Dell can show its dedication.  Walsh said:  ""The first thing to provide a payment method for our business and bitcoin is a great example of how we can show some innovation. We're always going to be looking for new, innovative ways to ensure we're driving the right experience.""  In recent years, the company has come under fire in the mainstream financial press for failing to adjust to the decline of PC sales that has resulted from increased smartphone use.  Possibilities ahead  While Walsh gave the impression that Dell is primarily focused on bitcoin as a payments play, the company may be uniquely positioned to exploit other potential market opportunities in the space.  For example, Dell has a professional Data Center Solutions team currently working on cloud computing and optimizing hyperscale data centers, tools that could no doubt position Dell to enter or serve the now booming industrial bitcoin mining space.  Still, while Dell could have an evident competitive advantage in the space, Walsh suggested the idea is not currently on the company's radar, saying:  ""We're familiar with [bitcoin mining]. It's not something we're looking at at this time, but we are familiar with it.""  Notably, Dell recently decided to shelve plans to build additional data centers in Europe, choosing instead to focus on data center management.  The company had earlier planned to purchase $1bn worth of data centers as recently as 2011.

Although no formal press release was made, airBaltic's website quietly began displaying the offering on 17th July. The company later acknowledged the decision when Twitter user Club Alpaca asked the company to confirm the news today.  A company representative in Riga said that the bitcoin payment option is offered for basic class fares, excluding China, Indonesia, India, Iceland, Jordan, Japan, Lebanon, Malaysia, Russia, Taiwan and Vietnam.  Other travel services companies have also begun accepting bitcoin this year, although airBaltic may be the first airline.  Billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson’s UK-based air carrier Virgin Atlantic has not begun accepting bitcoin, his space flight venture Virgin Galactic has. Just two months later six or seven people were confirmed for a space flight, paid for with bitcoin.  Customers question payment terms  Customers that choose to pay for their travel services in bitcoin still have to pay the €5.99 transaction fee, a decision one other Tweeter quickly challenged.    @ClubAlpaca Hello!

Bitcoin gains ground in travel sector  Last month travel giant Expedia began accepting bitcoin for hotel bookings, but not for flight reservations so far. The company did not close specific numbers, but recently told CoinDesk that the response has been better than anticipated.  In November, CheapAir began accepting bitcoin for flight bookings, and it has since expanded its services to 200,000 partner hotels and railway offerings. The company recently announced it has topped $1.5m in total bitcoin sales.  CoinDesk has reached out to airBaltic for more details, but has not received an immediate response.

42425894,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh1Dh,1405962023,"BTC China Launches USD, HKD Bitcoin Trading Accounts","Shanghai-based bitcoin and litecoin exchange BTC China has announced the launch of USD and HKD deposits and withdrawals, becoming the latest China-based exchange to publicly extend its services to the international community.  The news follows Beijing-based OKCoin's announcement at The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC) that it would be adding USD deposits this week as part of a broad push to court an international market that, for now, remains absent of large, professional US exchanges.  Addressing the announcement, BTC China CEO and Bitcoin Foundation board member Bobby Lee framed the product as a way for the company to give back to its users and the community, saying:  “As a global company, BTC China is pleased to accommodate the demands of our users, both domestic and international.""  The launch was preceded by an invite-only testing period, during which BTC China says it ""collected several million USD worth of deposits"".  The first bitcoin exchange in China, BTC China recently also expanded its product offerings for international users, launching a mobile bitcoin wallet in June.  Updated account offerings  BTC China indicated that the move was its first step in what could be broader support for additional currencies, as exchange users had been previously limited to deposits and withdrawals in Chinese yuan. As such, the company expects the new offerings to resonate in its home market.  Current users who want to take advantage of the newly supported currencies will need to open an international account in addition to a domestic account, the company said.  Hong Kong emphasis increases  The announcement also finds BTC China leveraging its position in Asia to work around the restrictions imposed in China. The company says all orders on the service will be processed via its registered Hong Kong affiliate, as Hong Kong has to date been more accommodating to digital currency businesses due to its status as a special administrative region.  The Chinese bitcoin market has faced continued uncertainty in recent months, following statements from the country's central bank, the People's Bank of China, that aimed to separate the companies from the traditional financial services sector.  Owing to the country's unique regulatory structure, formal guidance such as the kind proposed in New York may not ever be drafted to ease uncertainty. However, representatives from the central bank have stated publicly that they do not seek to ban digital currency altogether.  China courts US market  The announcement is notable given the recent emphasis bitcoin's China-based businesses are placing on the international market.  Speaking to CoinDesk at The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC), representatives from both OKCoin and Huobi suggested that given that restrictions of China's market, the country has emphasized bitcoin's use as a financial instrument rather than a payment method, and that because of this demand, they are uniquely suited to extend services internationally.  Further, OKCoin CTO Changpeng Zhao stated at TNABC that the company aims to provide 24-hour phone support to international customers, though it stopped short of openly encouraging US consumer use of its platform, saying that it is not registering for a money transmission licence in the US at this time.  BTC China has not commented on whether it will offer this guidance.

42425884,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh13h,1405957443,Isle of Man Clarifies Regulation for Digital Currency Businesses,"The Isle of Man Financial Supervision Commission (FSC) has clarified the application of existing regulations on bitcoin.  The FSC indicates that digital currency businesses will not be subject to a conduct of business or prudential regime by the commission unless they engage in activities regulated under the Financial Services Act of 2008, such as money transmission services.  The commission warns that there is no such consumer protection for entrants into the digital currency market. It also notes that it is not the appropriate time to introduce such a regime until the market develops and an international consensus on the matter is reached.  AML/CFT rules may apply  The commission's view is that market participants who do not understand the risks associated with digital currency are involved in a ""high risk area"" and need to be aware that there is no government protection in place for them.  However, this does not mean that the FSC is merely taking a wait-and-see approach. Some activities involving digital currencies will be affected in the near future.  The FSC says action is imminent:  ""In order to ensure that the Island’s international reputation is maintained, it has been decided that certain activities relating to virtual currencies should be brought within the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (“AML/CFT”) framework. As a result, certain amendments are currently being planned to Schedule 4 to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2008 which would apply the Island’s AML/CFT legislation to those involved in the virtual currencies market.""  The commission also said it is in the process of drafting a new bill that will provide it with the ability to oversee how digital currency operators comply with AML/CFT legislation.  Industry welcomes regulatory push  The latest FSC announcement is in line with previous statements made by the Isle of Man's Department of Economic Development and Peter Greenhill, the director of the departments E-Business Development office.  Earlier this year the FSC issued a legal opinion, confirming that bitcoin exchanges are not required to obtain a licence in the country for their activities. The FSC also concluded that money transmission regulations do not cover bitcoin exchange activities.  As a result of the generally positive environment being created for bitcoin businesses, new companies are already starting to appear, with CoinCorner.com recently becoming the first cryptocurrency exchange registered on the Isle of Man earlier this month.  Charlie Woolnough, Chairman of the Manx Digital Currency Association and CEO of CoinCorner.com, told CoinDesk that the statement is just another step toward a regulatory regime that will ultimately benefit the industry.  Woolnough explained:  ""It means that crypto-currency businesses already located in the Isle of Man, or those considering establishing businesses there, will gain additional credibility with their clients. It will also no doubt give financial institutions comfort that crypto-currency businesses located in the Isle of Man will be required to have in place similar AML and KYC procedures to themselves.""  Woolnough said the announcement builds on a previous statement from the Isle of Man government and paves the way to the introduction of a regulatory regime that will serve to further legitimise the cryptocurrency sector.  GoCoin's Eric Benz welcomed the latest FSC announcement, saying it is ""in line with their previous statements"" in respect to providing a friendly environment to bitcoin businesses.  ""The Isle of Man wants digital currency businesses to be there, as it is a safe and secure environment for them to showcase their technology while not engaging in activities which are criminal or damaging to the public. The Isle of Man Government is looking at creating a regulatory regime for digital currency and for this to happen requires primary legislation, which will take time. As it stands now, digital currency related businesses are able to obtain rulings on how they need to comply and operate direct from the Financial Supervision Commission,"" said Benz.

42425909,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh1fh,1405953616,Circle's Bitcoin Banking Platform is Savvy Bid for Mainstream Market,"Circle Internet Financial lifted the veil on its introductory product last week, providing CoinDesk with an extensive preview of what Circle.com will offer to the general market when it moves out of invite-only testing and past version one of its core offering.  The company revealed the first hints about what was to become Circle.com in March and, since then, it has been gradually ramping up development of its product while slowly expanding its pool of invited users.  First previewed at the Bitcoin2014 conference in Amsterdam this May, Circle largely delivers on its promise of providing a user-friendly digital money platform that delivers the kind of streamlined functionality many associate with traditional online payment tools like PayPal or Google Wallet.  Though questions about how Circle will expand and monetize this offering still remain, the company's first product demonstrates that the bitcoin industry as a whole has only begun to tap the potential of the technology, and that such applications could indeed have a broad appeal in the US market.  Launched in 2013, Circle has raised $26m to date, with its most recent round of funding netting the company $17m from Oak Investment Partners, Pantera Capital and SecondMarket CEO Barry Silbert's Bitcoin Opportunity Corp.  Logging in  After entering their username and password, Circle automatically sends a verification code to the user's smartphone. This two-factor authentication process can be bypassed by frequent users, as they have the option for the company to remember their computer for 30 days.  Alternatively, Circle customers can choose to use Google Authenticator, which generates the code via a smartpone app.  Once inside, users are greeted with a home screen that shows recent account activity and a message from Circle indicating that they now have $10 worth of BTC to spend. This balance is displayed at the top of the screen in both USD and BTC values.  Transferring existing bitcoin  Below the activity section, users will see the option to ""Transfer bitcoin to your circle account"" or ""Connect your bank account and credit cards to Circle"".  Those who want to transfer existing bitcoin to Circle will be greeted with a QR code and a bitcoin address that will allow them to transfer funds to the account. Circle uses dynamic QR codes that change with every transfer.  ""This prevents someone from spoofing your Circle account and intercepting payments,"" the company's website reads.  Circle also sends an email to the user, confirming the funds have been sent. CoinDesk tested a transfer from BTC-e to Circle and received the funds in under five minutes.  Linking your accounts  Conversely, users can take advantage of the 'Connect your bank account and credit cards to Circle' option.  To begin, users click 'Connect Account'. Circle then takes users to a landing page before sending them through a three-step process that confirms the account.  To add a bank account, users need to first enter their legal first and last names and their address, including the zip code, city and state. Users next verify their identity by providing their date of birth and social security number.  Credit card users must provide their card number, expiration date, billing address and security code, while bank account users need to provide their account name, routing number and account number.  In turn, bank account deposit limits are capped at $2,500, with withdrawals limited to $10,000 per week. Credit card deposits are likewise capped at $500 and withdrawals have a $1,000 per week ceiling.  ""Across all of your Circle accounts there is a maximum amount that may be deposited and withdrawn in a given week. As you develop a transactional history with Circle, this limit may increase,"" the website states.  Users can also withdraw bitcoin funds to their credit card in order to make payments.  Verifying linked bank accounts takes two to three business days, as users need to confirm that they first received two small deposits from Circle.  Accounts can also be quickly removed with the simple click of a button.  Advanced features  Circle users with linked accounts can also take advantage of advanced features such as its Link Handler, which can be used to make Circle the default payment method for any bitcoin payment link on the Internet.  The service's 'Multiple Accounts' feature also lets users subdivide their bitcoin funds into different accounts that can be labeled for better money management.  Users can also change their two-factor authentication settings so that verification is required for the transaction of any amount or amounts over a certain value.  Disclaimer: Circle.com is still undergoing stress tests and changes could be made to the final product before launch. This article should not be viewed as an endorsement of the service mentioned.

Currently, security, practicality and problems related to speculation and hoarding are the biggest issues facing bitcoin, he said at an event sponsored by the NYC Foundation for Computer Science Education.  Wilson  is the co-founder of venture capital firm Union Square Ventures, which has made investments in a number of successful tech start-ups, including Twitter, Tumblr, Kickstarter and Zynga. The company also has a focus on bitcoin, investing in digital currency startups rather than the currency itself.  As a proponent of digital currencies, Wilson attended the New York State bitcoin hearings in January, and has previously said the block chain could be an even bigger opportunity than bitcoin.  In his NYU speech, Wilson said:  ""What bitcoin does is remove the need for that central entity, that central computer and central company. The way I like to think about bitcoin is like PayPal, but open source, peer-to-peer and not controlled by a company.""  The problem with hoarding  Wilson said that rampant speculation, bitcoin hoarding and price volatility go hand in hand, arguing that most people still decide to sit on bitcoin, effectively hoarding it and waiting for the price to go up. Such behaviour causes supply problems, affecting volume and price in the process.  Wilson explained:  ""I also think we need to see real transaction volume happen. Right now, most people who get bitcoin hold it, they don't transact with it. That’s part of what causes all of the volatility — if there was a very vibrant system where bitcoin was just getting swapped around like crazy, the velocity of the money would cause bitcoin's price to stabilize and there would be a much more liquid market. I think those are the kinds of things an economist would want to see.""  Another problem that keeps volumes low, he said, is the fact that buying bitcoin is not as straightforward as it seems. Wilson indicated that it can take days for bitcoin to show up in his account once he buys some. This simply is not practical if you want to use the cryptocurrency on a day-to-day basis.  Improved security essential  Wilson further identified a lack of security as a major challenge facing bitcoin, and one that is hampering mainstream adoption.  He argued that it is still relatively easy to hack into people's computers, and thus into bitcoin wallets hosted there, while bad actors running bitcoin businesses pose a threat to public confidence in the digital currency:  ""Bitcoin theft is a big issue. Bitcoin fraud is a big issue. And what will have to happen is we will need to see companies like Coinbase and others merge that can invest heavily in security. And that's both technological security, and also process security, to make you comfortable to keep your bitcoin there. And I think that that's probably going to be first big commercial opportunity in bitcoin, [...] to create secure systems. Because without that, I don't think we'll ever get enough confidence and trust in the system for people to really start using it.""  More potential than teething problems  Wilson did not simply address concerns and challenges, he also talked about bitcoin's unique properties that make it an attractive payment option for merchants, charities and other organisations.  ""The thing that's cool about bitcoin is that it like cash on a wire, or cash over the air. It's like I'm giving you a five dollar bill, but it comes into your account over the Internet and there is nobody to pay for the transaction. That is a big deal,"" he said.  Wilson pointed out that crowdfunding platforms, charities and many businesses rely on relatively small individual transactions. The fees pile up quickly and allowing a charity or a crowdfunded project to keep 2-5% of the cash they raise in their pocket makes a big difference.  ""All of that money is going to go to the cause we care about. None of that is going to go to a third party that is making money off of the charity,"" he added.  Some of Wilson's assertions have been met with vocal criticism from the bitcoin community on reddit and other online forums. In response he took to reddit on Sunday to clarify his position on these and other concerns.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/21/investor-fred-wilson-security-and-hoarding-are-holding-back-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4ca91ec0c7eeef4851cdfe26ea326c4133b0cd7-1612x1075.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397789,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEAP4,1405939549,Can New York's BitLicense Prevent Another Mt. Gox Catastrophe?,"The release of proposed digital currency business regulations by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has raised numerous questions, many of which focus on the threat to innovation in the space and the impact on broader adoption. Yet one question that may be worth considering is this: will these regulations stop another Mt. Gox catastrophe?  While it can’t be said that any regulatory scheme is 100% successful at weeding out bad actors or poorly run businesses, the rules proposed by the NYDFS appear to be a step in the right direction by enforcing strict cybersecurity requirements. These include required penetration trials on an annual basis for digital currency platforms and the mandated appointment of a chief information security officer by a company that seeks to receive a 'BitLicense'.  As the proposal outlines:  “Each Licensee shall establish and maintain an effective cyber security program to ensure the availability and functionality of the Licensee’s electronic systems and to protect those systems and any sensitive data stored on those systems from unauthorized access, use, or tampering.”  Preventing assaults on critical infrastructure – and wallets containing customer funds, most importantly - is the chief aim of these regulations. Additionally, the NYDFS is requiring the creation of emergency policies in the event of a digital currency business experiences a catastrophic incident.  Broad focus on cybersecurity  The regulations attempt to leave no stone unturned in terms of the types of cyber threats that a digital currency business may face. Companies are required to actively assess threats and maintain robust systems that can repel the sorts of attacks that resulted in the failure of Mt. Gox and the loss of millions of dollars in customer funds.  The NYDFS is proposing to mandate that each digital currency company institute comprehensive cybersecurity policies that cover any potential vulnerabilities. Specifically, each company’s leadership is required to certify, at least annually, that such a policy has been followed successfully, and to make changes when necessary.  Reporting-wise, the NYDFS will require that each company provide proof that their internal security systems are sufficient to the task. Each licensee must submit annual reports to the state regulator that accurately depict the functionality and capability of security systems.  Internal auditing is also required on a number of key fronts, including penetration tests to discover and rectify weaknesses. Penetration testing is required at least once a year, along with quarterly assessments that certify the continued strength of these systems.  Digital currency businesses are also required to maintain clear audit trails that include transaction data, user login timesheets and access logs to company hardware.  Whether or not this level of scrutiny will have a negative impact on digital currency businesses in the state remains to be seen.  As some in the bitcoin industry have commented, strict reporting requirements impose unnecessary costs that are more harmful for startups than they are for establish companies. On the other hand, others say that in the case of Mt. Gox, more robust oversight may have prevented the missteps that resulted in its collapse.  Security leadership a requirement  In order to maintain and update the proposed cybersecurity policies that each licensee will create, the NYDFS is mandated the appointment of a chief information security officer (CISO).  This aspect of the regulations addresses one of the criticisms levied toward Mt. Gox – that clear leadership roles were not defined, allowing for the types of lapses that resulted in broad vulnerability. One might argue that by acting as chief engineer as well as the head of day-to-day management, CEO Mark Karpeles was not able to focus enough on the cyber threats that ultimately brought down the exchange.  As the regulations read:  “Each Licensee shall designate a qualified employee to serve as the Licensee’s Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) responsible for overseeing and implementing the Licensee’s cyber security program and enforcing its cyber security policy.”  This position is intended to oversee digital security efforts and facilitate reporting to the state regulator as required. The CISO will report to the digital currency company’s senior leadership, drawing up the security framework and making changes when needed.  Worst-case scenarios  But what about when a digital currency company falls apart? In the wake of revelations that Mt. Gox had lost customer funds, the exchange found itself crippled and unable to function. Arguably, the fact that the company lacked no clear disaster-management policy exacerbated problems resulting from both the hack and the subsequent response.  Licensees must establish operating procedures to take effect should a catastrophic event render the company unable to function. This includes identifying critical functions, infrastructure and personnel that will assume control if business failure becomes a possibility. BitLicense recipients must also provide comprehensive training to all relevant personnel that would become involved during disaster management.  Furthermore, companies are required to report any incidents that may pose a risk to operational integrity. The proposal reads:  “Each Licensee shall promptly notify the superintendent of any emergency or other disruption to its operations that may affect its ability to fulfill regulatory obligations or that may have a significant adverse effect on the Licensee, its counterparties, or the market.”  Combined, these requirements are designed to keep a digital currency business running should sudden problems arise. Though untested – for now – the proposal aims to circumvent critical disruptions that would, in that case, leave customers even more vulnerable to losses.  Time will tell  For now, it’s impossible to judge whether or not the BitLicense proposal will help deflect cyber threats and protect consumers from emergency situations like those encountered by Mt. Gox. Like laws governing the management of bank failures, regulations can’t truly be tested until a real situation arises.  Yet, according to NYDFS Superintendent Benjamin M Lawsky, who sat down for an interview with CNBC on the proposal, the kinds of regulations he is proposing should be instituted across the broader financial system. He reiterated his support for the regulations and said that banks and other financial companies need to step up their own efforts to prevent destabilizing hacks.  In the interview, Lawsky was asked whether or not the NYDFS would have been able to prevent or at least contain a Mt. Gox-esque situation, or any situation in which a sustained attack put customer funds at risk. He replied that the cybersecurity proposals would have been helpful, but suggested that the broader financial system suffers from the same kinds of weaknesses.  He said:  “We’re going to go in and test the cybersecurity readiness of these firms in New York, to make sure they’re doing everything they can to prevent that kind of hacking attack. Look, you could say that about our entire banking industry, too. We should be doing that about everyone.”  Statue of Liberty image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/21/can-new-yorks-bitlicense-prevent-another-mt-gox-catastrophe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6049b6e224ffc7734da27850ec134a8224770b6d-1300x870.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397796,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEAXv,1405900839,TNABC Day 2: Bitcoin's Diverse Community on Full Display,"Day two of The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC) was at times unpredictable – featuring a notable cancelled appearance and a few schedule changes. However, it ultimately succeeded at showcasing the wide range of individuals who are now actively engaged in various parts of the ecosystem.  This diversity of both demographics and ideas was perhaps best illustrated in the day's panel sessions, which included talks dedicated to women and students working in the space as well as an ad-hoc discussion on bitcoin 2.0 by legal thought leaders like Marco Santori and Jacob Farber.  The full scope of the community could also be seen in the major business leaders who spoke at the event, representing a range of verticals from bitcoin mining to e-commerce and merchant processing.  Through this, the conference was also able to highlight just how interconnected the industry remains despite the increased VC interest and mainstream media attention, a point alluded to by event organiser Moe Levin in his closing remarks.  Levin said:  ""Bitcoin began as a community initiative and prospers today for the same reason. Coming together, talking face to face, is essential to us remaining a community.""  Elsewhere, the day featured sessions led by Bitcoin Shop CEO Charles Allen; CloudHashing's Lukas Gilkey; and a surprise session led by Charlie Shrem, who appeared via a telepresence robot.  Regulation debate continues  Although not as apparent in today's discussions, New York's proposed regulations for bitcoin businesses proved to be a continued topic of interest – one that was addressed most forcefully by Bitcoin Association board member and an outspoken critic of bitcoin regulation, Bruce Fenton.  Fenton delivered an impassioned speech to the morning audience that encouraged attendees to question the information they have been receiving from New York state officials.  Further, he suggested that NYDFS Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky may be motivated by higher political office in his decision making, or that the regulations may have been the product of his involvement with the banking industry.    ""Not one CEO has come to me and said 'It's good that we can't own bitcoin'"" - @brucefenton on bitlicenses      — CoinDesk (@coindesk) July 20, 2014    The regulation was also dissected during a panel on bitcoin 2.0 innovations, though there the proposal was viewed more as a disappointment to a community that had expected to be given the same room for experimentation that the Internet enjoyed during its formation.  The panel addressed how the laws would impart a number of restrictions on the broad application of bitcoin's underlying technology in its attempt to ensure consumers are protected from financial harm, and touched on the negative impact this could have on the ecosystem as a whole.  Innovation ahead  The afternoon's schedule was interrupted by the absence of BlockStream's Austin Hill, whose session never materialized. Levin was not able to comment on the reason for the rescheduling, however, Hill did address the subject with a presumably tongue-in-cheek tweet.    Hate to undermine the organizers of the Chicago Bitcoin conf,but it turns out they suspect im Satosh i& I got picked up and am in chains — Austin Hill (@austinhill) July 20, 2014          Ultimately, the session was replaced, however, by a diverse panel discussing bitcoin 2.0 innovation, or the development of alternative ways to apply bitcoin's decentralized technology. The talk featured Bitcoin Foundation general counsel Patrick Murck; Marco Santori; Ripple Labs CTO Stefan Thomas; Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin; and Perkins Coie senior counsel Jacob Farber, among others.  The gathered speakers discussed broadly how bitcoin 2.0 projects are innovating and adding to the bitcoin space, while touching on problem areas such as how consumers could differentiate between the complex offerings and when and if their related products could impact that average bitcoin user.  Speaking to the consensus of the group, Farber said:  ""There's the notion that the [bitcoin] 2.0 ventures being a set of tools that aren't mutually exclusive. I think there's going to be more interlinking over time.""  In the talk, Thomas also built on points mentioned in his earlier speaking slot, which addressed how Ripple is seeking to use smart contracts with its latest launch Codius.  Similarly, Buterin echoed comments from his earlier speech, in which he gave an overview of cryptographic systems, how centralized payment methods like PayPal can be improved, and Ethereum and its ongoing development.  BitPay moves mainstream  The extended breakdown of bitcoin 2.0 was contrasted by an earlier talk given by BitPay executive chairman Tony Gallippi, who aimed to broadly connect the company's recent moves to illustrate how they form a cohesive vision for taking the initial application of bitcoin technology mainstream.  Gallippi discussed BitAuth, the company's decentralized digital authentication platform, its new, open-source multisig wallet Copay and its new payroll API.  Notably, Gallippi suggested it may be this last offering that may be the most impactful of all, stating:  ""It's a benefit that employers can offer [bitcoin] to their employees. It's something that people are asking for, more than half of IT professionals are interested in this.""  He added that payroll should perhaps be a larger focus for the community, as most people throughout the world receive their local fiat currency through this method.  Gallippi ended the talk by welcoming ESPN's Brett Dulaney to speak about the Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl, which he said BitPay is seeking to leverage so that it provides maximum exposure for the entire bitcoin community.
