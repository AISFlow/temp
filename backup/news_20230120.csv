42413081,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7d2k,1674257612,"Genesis’ Crypto Trading Arm Is Moving Money Around, a Sign of Normality Amid Sibling’s Bankruptcy","Even as Genesis’ crypto-lending business entered bankruptcy court protection, the company’s trading arm, which remained out of Chapter 11, is still moving money around on blockchains – a sign the business was still running at least somewhat as normal.  A wallet controlled by the Genesis over-the-counter trading desk sent about $125 million of ether (ETH), fantom (FTM) and tether (USDT) to the Coinbase, Binance, Bitstamp and Kraken exchanges on Thursday, the day of the bankruptcy filing, according to blockchain data compiled by Etherscan. In the past several hours, the wallet has transacted several more times, receiving almost $50 million USD coin (USDC).  The movements match parent company Digital Currency Group’s (DCG) pledge that the Genesis trading business will “continue to operate business as usual.” (DCG is also CoinDesk's parent company.) It’s early yet, however, so it remains to be seen how the bankruptcy filing of Genesis’s lending entities will affect the spot and derivatives businesses over the long haul.  “The reputation of Genesis is in the bin,” Charles Storry, head of growth at crypto index platform Phuture, said in an interview with CoinDesk. “Maybe they keep some legacy clients. Maybe. As for introducing new clients, no chance while bankruptcy is in play.”  Frank Chaparro, a journalist at The Block, posted a Twitter poll asking users whether they would trade with Genesis after the lending division’s bankruptcy filing. As of press time, 73.7% of the 938 who responded voted “no.”  During the movement of crypto on Thursday, the OTC desk wallet sent 50,000 ETH to Coinbase, 20,000 ETH to Bitstamp and 5,000 ETH to Kraken. It sent an additional 7.7 million FTM worth roughly $2.4 million to Binance and $3.9 million USDT to Kraken, according to Etherscan.  This particular wallet typically moves funds on weekdays, Nansen.ai data shows, so the Thursday transactions looked basically normal amid the bankruptcy drama.  Genesis’ on-chain portfolio, composed of at least eight unique addresses, has a net worth of $307 million as of press time Friday: 74.7% of Genesis’ portfolio is ETH, while the next six tokens – USDC, compound (COMP) , the sandbox (SAND), apecoin (APE), decentraland (MANA) and aave (AAVE) – make up 13.8% of the entire portfolio.  This figure is most likely a conservative estimate of Genesis’ total holdings. DarkFi.eth, one of the white hats who stole and subsequently returned roughly $2 million from the Nomad bridge exploit in August 2022, told CoinDesk: “It is not strange for venture firms to obscure what wallets hold their tokens.” Even so, Genesis’ known holdings make it the third-biggest whale on Nansen’s Funds Leaderboard, after Jump Trading and Paradigm Capital.

The SEC explains the reason for the fine in a tweet, Today we charged Nexo Capital Inc. with failing to register the offer and sale of its retail crypto asset lending product, the Earn Interest Product (EIP). To settle charges, Nexo agreed to pay $22.5 million and cease its unregistered offer and sale of the EIP to U.S. investors. The $22.5 million fine for selling EIP to US investors. Moreover, the $22 million fine will go through settling the claims by State Regulatory Authorities. The SEC Chairman, Gary Gensler, reinforces that crypto organizations must comply with its policies. Failure to do so will allow the SEC to hold the defaulters accountable. Related Reading: JPMorgan Taps Former Celsius Exec As Crypto Regulatory Policy Director What Is EIP And Why The Fine? Starting in June 2020, Nexo is marketing and selling its Earn Interest Product (EIP) in the USA. Nexo operates so that it lends money to its customers, and interest becomes its primary source of income. Nexo uses this interest income to pay interest on its loans further. However, several states in the USA alleged that Nexo’s earn-interest service is not registered as a Security. As a result, the states of California, Oklahoma, Vermont, South Carolina, Kentucky, and Maryland took the company to court. They demanded a cease-and-desist order on the company’s EIP service. Related Reading: California State Kills Main Crypto Bill, Why? The SEC order says that Nexo used its EIP service to fund interest payments and inject it into its other businesses. Moreover, the SEC holds Nexo at fault because their EIP Security fails to meet the requirements for an exemption from the regulatory authority.

In response to the penalty, Nexo also published a settlement tweet confirming that they agree to a no-admit-no-deny settlement.

SEC Is Getting More Vigilant And Strict Noting some of the SEC’s previous actions on crypto companies, it can be said that it is tightening the noose. In February 2022, SEC fined BlockFi $100 million for its unregistered securities offerings. The BlockFi fine acted as a warning for several other crypto firms offering similar products. A Cornerstone Research finds several proceedings in which the SEC holds crypto companies accountable for their services, solutions, and actions. Over 30 such enforcement proceedings came under the chairmanship of Gary Gensler in 2022. Similar to the Nexo case, the SEC also charged Gemini for its unregistered service in the form of sales of securities.

42413084,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7d4c,1674254506,"Crypto Markets Today: Bitcoin Surges Above $22K, Genesis Has Over $5B in Liabilities","Crypto lending firm Genesis held $5.1 billion in liabilities in the weeks following its freeze on withdrawals in November, according to bankruptcy court documents signed by interim CEO Derar Islim.  This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  In a first-day motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, Islim provided a breakdown of Genesis’ financial state heading into its restructuring. Genesis became the latest crypto firm caught up in the immediate fallout of FTX’s implosion, with three of its entities – Genesis HoldCo, Genesis Global Capital LLC and Genesis Asia Pacific PTE. LTD – filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late Thursday.  Those entities were perhaps less affected by direct losses to FTX and sister company Alameda than by the “run on the bank” that Islim said their collapse sparked. Customers demanded Genesis repay $827 million in loans, forcing its lending units to freeze withdrawals.  “At the same time, Holdco’s corporate parent, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its various subsidiaries, including DCG International Investments Ltd., were also impacted by the market turmoil and did not have the liquidity to pay back the Company on certain loans, adding pressure to the Debtors’ balance sheets,” Islim said. (DCG is also the parent of CoinDesk.)  At least part of the liquidity crunch began months earlier thanks to Genesis’ $1.2 billion loss to crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), which collapsed in the summer of 2022. That loss came out of the Genesis Asia Pacific unit (that also filed for bankruptcy), which managed Genesis’ lending relationship with 3AC. At the time of 3AC going under, Genesis had $2.4 billion in outstanding loans to the fund, of which Genesis was able to recover just half, according to the filing.  DCG last year assumed much of that exposure, swapping a 10-year promissory note in exchange for Genesis’ $1.2 billion in claims against 3AC. That note is now at the center of DCG’s public spat with crypto exchange Gemini over the exchange’s yield product Earn, with Gemini being Genesis’ largest creditor at more than $700 million.

The exchange is often the most readily available choice for users in emerging markets, it added.  Binance is the world’s exchange by trading volume, according to CoinMarketCap data. Its more than $14 billion in spot trading volume over the past 24 hours exceeded the amount of the next 20 exchanges in CoinMarketCap’s rankings.  Amid last year’s macroeconomic chaos, inflation in Brazil and Russia, which CryptoCompare groups with other emerging economies, reached 11.9% and 17.2%, respectively. About the time of these highs, Russian ruble (RUB) and Brazilian real (BRL) volumes on Binance increased 232% and 72%, respectively.  Inflation has been even higher in other countries with less-developed economies, tempting consumers there to look for assets less subject to these spikes.  “We expect continued adoption and increased cryptocurrency volumes in emerging markets. Despite the inherent risks of cryptocurrencies,” the report said.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/20/binance-garnered-largest-market-share-of-crypto-investors-from-emerging-markets-in-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00cfdffb002fd35bcd1e9a5e0df5cf05bfe4df28-5130x3420.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

7820148,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516957,1674252017,"Bitcoin Short Squeeze May Reach $30,000, Top Crypto Trader Predicts","As Bitcoin breaks out of the $21k level, many crypto analysts have begun projecting further rallies for the asset. One of the famous crypto strategists, Crypto Kaleo, recently gave a high price prediction for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Addressing his over 550,000 followers on Twitter, Kaleo says BTC is preparing for a rally to $30,000. Bitcoin last saw $30,000 during the bear market in June 2022. However, the crypto strategist believes there would be fluctuations as Bitcoin targets $30,000, albeit his bullish stance. Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration In his words, the market should expect more falls before Bitcoin reaches $30,000. According to Kaleo, there would be some lows beneath $20k, which would trigger lower positions before Bitcoin can be ready for the short squeeze. A short squeeze occurs when crypto traders borrow assets at a particular price, hoping to sell them lower and keep the difference. These traders often use overleverage short positions in the futures market. However, the traders would have no choice but to buy the borrowed assets as price propulsion pushes against them, sparking more rallies as market makers take out their liquidity to keep the momentum. Kaleo is confident that the short squeeze is approaching since the BTC price has already jumped above 23% within seven days. Bitcoin Rally Could Signal Increased Volatility BTC has witnessed several bullish indicators since the beginning of 2023, bringing it to a year-high of over $21,000. Bitcoin’s bullish rallies have boosted crypto traders’ hopes that the long-running bear market could end soon. There has been a reduction in the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index to neutral, which might cause an increase in trading volume. A massive increase in Bitcoin trading volume followed the recent price surge. Throughout the past week, Bitcoin trading volume has climbed above double the initial value, reaching $10.8 billion, a 114% increase. An increase in trading volume often leads to a spike in volatility. Bitcoin’s current seven-day volatility level of 2.4% is below the 2022 value of 3.1% but remained stable during the recent rally. There is a likelihood that the constantly increasing trading volume during the rally may cause a spike in volatility. Centralized exchanges (CEXs) had to battle with low trading volume, which means lower transaction fees and revenue, including staff layoffs. Therefore, the rising trading volume is a welcomed development for the exchanges and BTC traders. Bitcoin Recovery Underway As Realized Profit And Trading Volume Increase According to Glassnode’s data, on-chain realized profits for BTC return to the adjusted spent output profit ratio (aSOPR) value of 1.0. Some analysts believe it is the critical resistance level. The aSOPR historically indicates a shift in the total market cycle when increasing demands (trading volumes) absorb profits. Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration BTC’s on-chain realized profit and loss ratio has jumped over the 1.0 mark, recording 1.56 profits against the January 16 losses. This marked a reversal of the downtrend that started in May 2022. An increase in realized gain without a price drop indicates market strength. On-chain analytics by Glassnode also suggest that a BTC price recovery is underway. As the market absorbs more selling pressure without a fall in price, the overall fear and macro shift will reduce. Technically, volatility, trading volume, and realized profits are pushing BTC decoupling from equities. Bitcoin’s previous price action correlates to US equities. The correlation to equities might have been due to asset accumulation by institutional investors. The correlation has reduced now that institutional investors hold fewer BTC and might exit the market in the future.

The foundation has a claim for $13 million against Genesis, according to bankruptcy filings.  In a statement to CoinDesk, the foundation confirmed it loaned around $13 million to Genesis in 2022 but called the sum “immaterial” in relation to the rest of its treasury.  “The outstanding claim represents an immaterial portion of our overall treasury and does not impact our operations in any way,” according to a Stellar Development Foundation representative.  According to its website, the “Stellar Development Foundation currently holds 30 billion XLM to be used for promoting and enhancing Stellar.” At current prices, Stellar’s holdings of its native XLM token place the paper value of its treasury above $200 million.  Though the foundation claims it has weathered the Genesis fiasco relatively unscathed, the entanglement of an ecosystem fund’s assets with the over-the-counter crypto lending desk underscores just how widespread the contagion of the Genesis fallout might be.

Prior to a late-Friday surge, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization had risen 10.15% and 9.92% respectively, and 25% and 28% year to date.  On a relative basis, BTC and ETH’s seven-day performance landed them near the top of the leaderboard for the first time this year. Among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap, BTC’s performance was third among the group. ETH ranked fourth.  The leaders on the week were solana (SOL) and polkadot (DOT), which rose 24% and 10.7%, respectively. The biggest laggards were litecoin (LTC) and monero (XMR), which fell 0.57% and 0.64%, respectively.  The dispersion between best and worst performance has narrowed significantly over the past 30 days. Where on Dec. 16 the poorest-performing assets logged seven-day losses in excess of 15%, this week’s laggard was essentially flat.  Crypto markets were trading higher on Friday as well. Markets were seemingly unaffected by the announcement that crypto lender (and CoinDesk sister company) Genesis had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

42413082,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7d5Y,1674250051,Bitcoin Miner 1Thash Sent Almost All Its BTC to Binance,"A Chinese miner has sent nearly 5,600 bitcoin (BTC), about $124 million worth, to the Binance crypto exchange, blockchain data shows, in what might be interpreted as a move to sell the holdings.  Bitcoin miner 1Thash sent almost its entire bag of bitcoin to Binance in a series of transactions earlier this week that were flagged by the analysis firm CryptoQuant. Binance is the largest crypto exchange by daily trading volume.  The conventional wisdom among crypto traders is that large BTC inflows from miners to exchanges like Binance is a bearish signal that miners may be preparing to sell BTC. The implication is that the recent crypto rally may have pushed prices to a level that’s too impossible to resist, especially with profit margins compressed in recent months by the crypto winter.  On Jan. 17 and Jan. 19, 1Thash transferred out 2,396 and 3,336 BTC, respectively, according to CryptoQuant data.  Julio Moreno, a senior analyst at CryptoQuant, indicated that the 3,336 BTC transferred on Jan. 19 was sent directly to Binance, while 94% of the 2,396 BTC transferred on Jan. 17 sat in three different wallets before landing in Binance.  The transfers on the two days were the highest outflows in CryptoQuant’s tracking history of 1Thash, which started in July 2020, two and a half years ago.  1Thash’s outflows cut the miner’s holdings to zero, while the BTC reserve balance for all miners dropped to its lowest level in a year at 1.837 million, data from CryptoQuant shows.  1Thash’s BTC outflows to Binance came as bitcoin, the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, climbed past $22,000.  1Thash is a “retired miner,” added Moreno, because the pool had only mined two blocks in the past 30 days. Moreover, in the past six months, 1Thash had mined only 13 blocks, data from the Mempool Open Source Project shows.  The bulk of 1Thash’s mining activity took place between Sept. 2019 and June 2021.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading as high as $22,387, up 5.4% over the previous 24 hours, shrugging off the announcement late Thursday that Genesis Global Holdco LLC, the holding company of troubled cryptocurrency lender Genesis Global Capital, had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late Thursday. (Genesis and CoinDesk are owned by Digital Currency Group.)  Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, noted Thursday that investors had priced in Genesis’ looming problems. The company has been swept up in the fallout from the collapses of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital last spring and, more recently, crypto exchange giant FTX.  Ether (ETH) followed a similar path, recently rising 5.2% from Thursday, same time, to $1,640. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was up 4.1%.  BTC has climbed 11% in the past seven days and is up 34% for the year. ETH has jumped 12% over the past week and is up 37% since Dec. 31.  Crypto-related stocks also benefited from the rally Friday: Exchange Coinbase (COIN) was recently up 10% while bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) surged 9%.  Traditional markets also edged up, with the S&P 500 index up 1.9%, as investors processed a flurry of mixed earnings reports from big banks.  This week’s larger-than-expected decline in the producer price index (PPI) indicated the U.S. Federal Reserve’s monetary hawkishness has been taming inflation, buoying investors. The CME FedWatch tool currently shows that traders see roughly a 97% chance that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will raise rates by just 25 basis points (0.25 percentage point) at its next meeting in February – slowing from the 50 basis-point hikes in the December meeting.  Sheraz Ahmed, managing partner at STORM Partners, told CoinDesk that while recent macro data – “including a modest pullback in inflation, downwards-trending wage and employment data and a seemingly weaker dollar”– have induced some market relief, how the Fed will handle monetary policy while balancing economic data and recession fears will have a big impact on the market overall.  ""Post-rally euphoria is always a great feeling but it should be treated with caution to avoid mistakes whether prices continue to rise or fall,” Ahmed said.  Oanda’s Moya said in a Friday note that if more tightening goes beyond the March meeting, “risky assets broadly, including crypto, could be vulnerable to major selling pressure.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/20/bitcoin-soars-over-22k-to-reach-four-month-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/56f23778165642eaf986fff1f6d30e701554ba10-1112x566.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With this, Ripple now dominates Australian crypto exchanges as the XRP community anticipates a final court ruling in the lawsuit with the U.S. SEC (Securities And Exchange Commission). The news came from Financial Review, an Australian media outlet shared on Twitter by Neil Smith, Ripple’s partner engineer, and Aussie firm, Blockchain Australia. Ripple now dominates Australian crypto exchange volumes #XRP https://t.co/yaeFIqsNIn — Neil Smith (@nsmithau) January 18, 2023 Reason For XRP Performance In Australia According to the report, Ripple’s cross-border remittance payment (ODL) use case adoption gets the credit for this achievement. Ripple on-demand liquidity makes XRP suitable for cross-border payments as it helps customers access liquidity using this token. Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration XRP itself serves as a bridge token between fiat currencies. It allows users to make payments in local currency at the payment destination within seconds, hence the name, on-demand liquidity. Following the report’s details, Ripple’s native coin contributed to 62% of the trading volumes on the BTC Market, a Melbourne-based exchange. It also accounted for 82% of the Independent Reserve Exchange over the past day. CEO of BTC Markets Caroline Bowler said her crypto exchange is a Ripple on-demand (ODL) liquidity partner in Australia. That explains XRP’s dominance in the exchanges’ trading volume. According to Bowler, Ripple ODL helps firms to run cross-border payments without incurring banking or pre-funding costs. It uses Ripple’s native coin to power part of the process, which explains the trading volumes on the BTC Market platform. As Bowler further explained, Ripple’s native coin shares a higher percentage on their platform while the overall transaction volumes in the crypto market remain down. Meanwhile, XRP transactions score a 24-hour volume of $10.2 million on the Sydney-based crypto exchange, Independent Reserve. This number is more than other countries’ trading volumes put together. CEO of Independent Research, Adrian Prezelozny, said market makers and international remitters on the ODL network are part of their XRP trading clients. Status Of Long-Standing Ripple/SEC Lawsuit While XRP scores these wins in Australia, Ripple is still in a legal battle with the SEC over the token’s status as a security. According to Stuart Alderoty, chief attorney for Ripple in the lawsuit, the outcome will significantly impact the entire cryptocurrency market. Bloomberg also stated that the soon-to-come ruling would clarify who should handle crypto oversight. It would also define assets that qualify as securities or those that do not. Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration Both parties in the Ripple case have filed motions for summary judgment. According to Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, and Stuart Alderoty, the ruling is expected to come in the first half of 2023. James K. Filan said the court ruling might go as early as March.

Architect seeks to create trading software tailored toward institutions trading in decentralized finance (DeFi), allowing people to potentially get their ""confidence back in trading in this industry,"" said Harrison, who has been focused on the venture since leaving FTX US in September 2022, told Bloomberg in a recent interview. FTX filed for Chapter 11 protection on Nov. 11 in the face a liquidity crisis that sent shockwaves through the broader market and caused venture funding for crypto startups to plunge. Still, in December 2022, Harrison was said to have attempted to raise $6M at a $60M valuation. Other backers in the current round include Anthony Scaramucci, whose firm in September sold a 30% stake to FTX's venture capital unit, and SALT Fund, which is managed by his son, AJ Scaramucci.

Guaranteed senior unsecured notes were downgraded from B1 to Ba2, the company said.  “The rating action reflects Coinbase's substantially weakened revenue and cash flow generation capacity due to the challenging conditions in the crypto asset operating environment characterized by steep declines in crypto asset prices and lower customer trading activity,” Moody’s said. “Moody's expects the company's profitability to remain challenged despite its [Jan. 10] announcement of a reduction in its global workforce of around 950 employees.”  Read more: Coinbase Cuts Around 20% of Workforce as Crypto Winter Rages  Moody’s also mentioned the fallout from the FTX exchange’s collapse and the possible resulting regulatory tightening on the crypto industry as a reason for the negative outlook on Coinbase’s revenue.  “Although increased regulatory oversight could ultimately favor the relatively more mature and compliant crypto asset platforms such as Coinbase, Moody's said that the path to changes and enhancements in the regulatory framework is highly uncertain and could prove disruptive to crypto market participants.”  Earlier this month, S&P Global Ratings, the biggest global ratings agency, also downgraded its long-term credit rating and senior unsecured debt rating on Coinbase, for similar reasons.  Shares of Coinbase dropped 86% in 2022, partly because trading volume for cryptocurrencies, which continues to be Coinbase’s main revenue stream, slowed after crypto prices dropped sharply during the year, and crypto firms including Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network and FTX collapsed.

42413074,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7cz0,1674246537,What's Next for Genesis Creditors? It Depends on What's in the Bankruptcy Filing,"Three of Genesis’ crypto lending businesses have filed for bankruptcy protection, and that means creditors will likely take some hits, according to Eric Snyder, a partner at Wilk Auslander LLP.  Snyder, chair of the firm’s bankruptcy department, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Friday it's unknown right now how much of a ""haircut"" Genesis' creditors could suffer. A haircut refers to the lower-than-market value placed on an asset being used as collateral for a loan.  The Genesis companies' bankruptcy filings included a plan but not a “disclosure statement,” which typically includes what's in the plan, Snyder said.  ""The issue is, what is the value of the collateral?"" he said. It's one thing if the collateral is cash, real estate or marketable securities. But when it comes to crypto, ""it's very difficult to tell what the markets are. For example, if they're holding FTT coins, we know that's going to have very limited value. So we just need to understand what kind of crypto they're holding or the kind of collateral they're holding,"" Snyder said, referring the token issued by the failed FTX crypto exchange.  According to his reading of the Genesis petitions, “their goal is either to sell themselves in an asset sale, or substantially [place] all of their assets under a plan and then decide who gets the assets,” Snyder said. “If [they] can't be sold then they're going to transfer all the assets to a general unsecured creditor trust.”  Snyder said if the companies can’t make a sale, a trustee for the creditors would then “run the operation until a buyer” can be found, “basically admitting that they’re giving it up,” he said.  Genesis Global Holdco LLC, the holding company of crypto lender Genesis Global Capital, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York late Thursday. Also filing was Genesis Global Capital and Genesis' Asia-based subsidiary.  Genesis owes over $3.5 billion to its top 50 creditors. In a separate filing on Friday, Genesis said it has over $5 billion in liabilities.  Still, it may “take a long time” to figure out Genesis' assets and liabilities, Snyder said.

SOL which has been on an uptrend in the past week saw a 28.44% increase during this time. This increase might be due to combined economic factors and Solana’s growing utility among crypto users. What Is Driving The Price Of Solana? The Solana network is enjoying more attention from the increased crypto awareness and adoption among individual and institutional investors. The network has rolled out plans for 2023, creating excitement among its online community. Related Reading: XRP Vs. Cardano (ADA), Which Is The Better Investment In 2023? The SOL network provides developers access and a framework to build DApps on its blockchain. For instance, Phantom, a crypto wallet, is hosted on the Solana blockchain. The wallet supports decentralized finance, staking, and NFT transactions for Solana users. Also, SolanaMobile, on Twitter, announced its intention to launch Solana Mobile Stack and Saga phones. The mobile phone will bring the Solana blockchain to the fingertips of users. Users are keen on the launch of the device, slated for this early this year. Additionally, as an altcoin, Solana correlates to bitcoin in price action. So, Bitcoin’s recent rally and other economic factors might be influencing SOL’s price. The macroeconomic factors affecting SOL price include a low Consumer Price Index (CPI) value for December 2022. The CPI notes the overall change in consumer prices in a specific timeframe. These factors combined could be responsible for SOL’s price surge in the past few weeks. Solana Price Prediction: Will SOL Break Its Resistance? SOL is recovering from yesterday’s slight pullback, trading at $21.28. The support levels are $19.60, $20.09, and $20.75, while the resistance levels are $21.90, $22.40, and $23.05. SOL is trading below its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and 200-day SMA on the weekly charts. These signs point to a bearish trend or slight reversal in the price of SOL ahead. Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is close to the oversold region at 43.04 and might continue to descend if the bears sustain their charge.

42413077,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7d0s,1674243870,"SEC Sues Eisenberg for Draining Mango Markets, Alleges MNGO a Security","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday charged decentralized finance (DeFi) trader Avraham Eisenberg over his draining of $116 million from Solana-based decentralized exchange Mango Markets. But this action could have a wider effect.  The SEC’s charges rest on the agency’s assertion that MNGO, Mango Markets’ governance token, is a security, much like its arguments in previous actions that have put the crypto industry on its guard.  Eisenberg, 27, already faced criminal commodities fraud charges for his admitted role in orchestrating the “highly profitable trading strategy” against Mango Markets in October.  Apart from his actions, the SEC complaint detailed the Howey Test standards the agency used to call MNGO a security, much as the agency has done in previous enforcement actions – most notably the former Coinbase (COIN) manager's insider-trading case where the SEC declared nine tokens as unregistered securities without directly accusing the token issuers or Coinbase of anything. As in that case, the Mango action doesn't go after Mango Markets, the exchange.  A Mango co-founder didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  The SEC's backdoor listings of which tokens it considers securities have sent shudders through the law firms that represent crypto clients.  In this case, the agency said that despite MNGO’s labeling as a “governance token,” it “was purchased and sold as a crypto asset security.” Its holders had expectations of profit and “entered into a common enterprise” – two of the factors the SEC looks for in identifying investment contracts that fall under securities laws. And holders of MNGO can use their tokens to vote in decisions governing Mango Markets’ operations, the agency said.  SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and his enforcement officials have recently been amplifying their warnings that the regulator is losing patience with unregistered securities and the unregistered exchanges where they trade.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission already hit Eisenberg last week with accusations he’d manipulated the market.

42411264,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMWGD,1674242972,Bad Vibes from the Word 'Crypto' Have Some Calling for a Rebrand,"Forget the Great Reset. Members of the industry known as “crypto” (or is it “blockchain,” “digital assets” or “distributed ledger technology?”) attending this week’s World Economic Forum under the shadow of the crisis known as “FTX” are spurring a great rebrand.  In the wake of the Bahamas-based exchange’s meltdown, “crypto” and “NFTs” (non-fungible tokens) have become trigger words for skeptics who dismiss this technology as hot air with no utility – much as “blockchain” was viewed in 2018 around the initial coin offering (ICO) bubble, when, in one notorious case, the Long Island Iced Tea company infamously renamed itself Long Blockchain Corp.  Hence, there was talk of a new lexicon (we’re stuck with “crypto” for now) as business leaders tried to convince policymakers attending the talkfest in Davos, Switzerland, of the need for constructive regulation or sought deals, engagement or just acceptance by leaders of mainstream companies who’d also turned out in force.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  I’m sure many readers of this column will recoil at this effort. Some may even see it as a centralizing power grab.  Maybe that’s fair. This annual gathering in the Swiss Alps, often cited for hypocrisy, empty talk and elitism, is a lightning rod among many who believe in the potential for cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies to upend the existing, inequitable global economy. You don’t have to share the conspiracy theorists’ views of WEF founder Klaus Schwab’s “Great Reset” idea to have concerns about the many Davos member companies and institutions whose business models perpetuate that system’s exploitative, centralized power structure.  But it’s also clear that “crypto” is now being widely associated with “have-fun-staying-poor” crypto bros and with what MIT Digital Currency Initiative Director Neha Narula calls “token casinos.” That the word now makes policymakers and executives squeamish is a barrier to progress for any crypto industry leader looking to engage with them.  It might not be such a bad idea to find words that don’t sound so foreign or threatening, words that encapsulate more universally and positively recognized ideas.  Brynly Llyr, the head of blockchain and digital assets at the World Economic Forum, suggested “decentralized systems” as a phrase that’s accurately descriptive of the function this technology plays without risking a negative association with crypto culture.  Watch: Crypto Outlook at The World Economic Forum  Others are simply resurfacing “blockchain,” hoping it will be more palatable to businesses that want to use these systems to manage enterprise needs. (One concern here is that word was associated with the “permissioned” blockchain systems once favored by business consortia, systems which weren’t really decentralized and added no real value as a result. Nowadays, with businesses increasingly building Web3 strategies on permissionless layer 1 protocols such as Ethereum, the retrograde connotation of “blockchain” may not be so bad.)  Imprecise language  The industry’s language problem goes beyond the negative connotations of “crypto.” It’s also that catchall words lack precision and vital nuance.  For example, there are multiple types of tokens. These include commodity tokens like ether (ETH) that power public blockchains; store-of-value assets such as bitcoin (BTC); payment tokens such as USDC; and NFTs, which are essentially markers of scarce digital objects. All are often lumped under the label “cryptocurrencies,” which fosters an association with the traditional idea of “currencies” and carries distinct legal and political connotations.  Read more: What is Cryptocurrency?  This imprecision creates problems for participants in this industry when they negotiate over rules or terms of service with each other and with policymakers and non-crypto businesses.  “Too often we’re talking past each other,” says David Treat, senior managing director of Accenture’s blockchain practice. “People apply an argument about one domain which doesn’t really work with all the others.”  Treat is looking for a taxonomy framework that “allows us to see the interplay between the tokenization of identity, money and objects so that we don’t get sucked into one myopic facet of this and miss the wider, important conversation.”  Obsessing about words in this way might seem beside-the-point when the most important thing is to come up with protections against the kind of malfeasance that led to the FTX collapse. But amid reports that compliance officers are now giving banks blanket instructions to block services to any entity that’s touched” crypto” – if taken literally, a group that includes the likes of Microsoft, Starbucks and, ironically, BNY Mellon – it’s clear that we all need to get clearer with our words.  Read more: CoinDesk's Crypto Glossary  Who decides, though? This is not a central marketing department or chief brand officer that can dictate what brand labeling this industry should use.

7815234,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516894,1674241222,This Metric Suggests Bitcoin Could Be In Danger Of Another Selloff,"A Bitcoin on-chain indicator is currently forming a pattern that has previously led to significant selloffs of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin 100-Day SMA Supply Adjusted Dormancy Has Rapidly Gone Up As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the selloff could potentially be even stronger than the one seen in November 2018. A relevant concept here is of a “coin day,” which is the amount of 1 BTC accumulated after sitting still on the chain for 1 day. Thus, when a token stays dormant for a certain number of days, it gains coin days of the same amount. However, when this coin is finally moved, its coin days naturally reset back to zero, and the coin days it had previously accumulated are said to be destroyed. An indicator called the “Coin Days Destroyed” (CDD) measures the total amount of such coin days being destroyed through transfers on the entire Bitcoin network. When the CDD is divided by the total number of coins being involved in transactions, a new metric called the “average dormancy” is obtained. This metric is so named because it tells us how dormant the average coin being transferred on the chain currently is (as dormancy is nothing but the number of coin days). When the average dormancy is high, it means coins being moved right now are quite aged on average. On the other hand, low values imply investors are currently transferring coins that they only recently acquired. Related Reading: Bitcoin Drops To $20,700 As Miner Outflows Surge Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 100-day simple moving average (SMA) Bitcoin dormancy over the last few years: The 100-day SMA value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant Note that the version of the metric in the graph is actually the supply-adjusted dormancy, which is simply calculated by dividing the original indicator by the total amount of Bitcoin supply that’s currently in circulation. Related Reading: Binance USD (BUSD) Exchange Reserves Dry Up, Reason Behind Bitcoin’s Slowdown? The reason behind this change lies in the fact that the supply of the crypto isn’t constant, but rather moving up with time. So, accounting for this adjustment makes it so that comparisons with previous cycles are easier to do. As you can see in the above chart, the Bitcoin supply-adjusted dormancy has been on a steady uptrend since the lows observed following the FTX crash. This means that the old supply has been observing rising activity recently, suggesting that the long-term holders might be exerting selling pressure on the market. The quant notes that a similar trend in the indicator was also seen back in August 2018, where the metric started on an uptrend from the lows seen early in that month. Three months after this uptrend started, BTC observed its final leg down of the bear market, during the crash of November 2018. If this previous trend is anything to go by, then Bitcoin could be at risk for another selloff soon. And since the uptrend in the metric this time around is even sharper, a potential plunge might be deeper as well.

While watchful for warning signs, he also hasn't changed his mind that a ""soft landing"" is possible — ""that it was quite possible to make progress on inflation without seriously damaging the labor market.

7813670,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516913,1674237613,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Is Up 4% As Lead Dev Teases Exact Beta Launch Date,"The second most popular meme coin on the crypto market, Shiba Inu (SHIB), is about to launch its eagerly awaited layer 2 scaling solution Shibarium. While lead developer Shytoshi Kusama has repeatedly said in recent weeks that the launch date is not yet set but will be “soon,” he may now have leaked the beta launch date himself wrapped in a word puzzle. He revealed the decisive hint in his Twitter bio, where he writes: Tending the Pine Tree of Life. Quickly learning to play the flute before putting Shibarium in a heart shaped box with a bow. For the Shiba Inu community, this is an unmistakable clue that the beta version of Shibarium will be released on Valentine’s Day, February 14. Already on January 15, Kusama had posted a prelude to his announcement, where he mysteriously stated: During fall the tree may have only a few leaves, but then spring appears. Luckily, Shibarium, in this context, is a Pine Tree. Still, it needs water, sunlight and proper soil. But pines survive and thrive during the harshest winters. (I also hear the needle tea is good for you.) Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Reacts By Moving Up 4% Shiba Inu (SHIB) has risen almost 4% in the last 24 hours and 21% within the last week, with the price currently standing at $0.00001249. Trading volume was around $305 million within the last 24 hours, representing a -55% decrease against the previous time period. Year-to-date (YTD), SHIB is up about 43% at the current price, the highest level since early November 2022. Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s BONE Bags New Listing As Token Surges 14% In 7 days This rally has been mainly driven by two reasons: on the one hand, macroeconomic sentiment has improved substantially, giving the overall crypto market a strong boost, and on the other hand, Shibarium has provided some level of FOMO. However, a look at the 1-week chart of SHIB reveals that the price should still be assessed as mostly bearish. In its third attempt since September 2022, SHIB’s price has failed to close above $0.000014 on a weekly basis. The resistance zone between $0.000013 and $0.000014 has so far proved too stubborn to confirm a breakout from the bearish territory. The 1-day chart shows the massive drop from the lower end of the resistance zone at $0.000013 very clearly. Currently, however, SHIB is finding support from the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Jumps By 21%, Here’s Why As signaled by the daily RSI, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is in an overbought condition. On a daily basis, the RSI remained significantly in the overbought zone, 79 at press time. Ideally, the RSI causes investors to reduce their positions and thus initiate a price correction on a price basis. Otherwise, there would have to be a correction on a time basis, which would mean a longer sideways trend below the resistance zone. To trigger a sustained bullish breakout on the daily and weekly charts, Shiba Inu needs to break above the $0.000014 level within the next few weeks.

This rally has been following a WSJ interview with current FTX CEO John Ray insinuating a rebooted FTX is a possibility. The team overseeing the FTX bankruptcy is likely trying to liquidate over half a billion in FTT - don't be the exit liquidity. It's been a little over two months since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX (FTT-USD) and a lot has happened. In that time, we've had congressional hearings, the indictment of former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried shortly before he was to speak at said hearings, and the repeated assertion from Bankman-Fried through various interviews and social channels that US-based customer assets should be safe. Current CEO John Ray, who has taken over the entity to oversee bankruptcy, hasn't ruled out the possibility of rebooting FTX. Wild times. According to the Wall Street Journal, relaunching FTX is something that's actually being considered: Everything is on the table. If there is a path forward on that, then we will not only explore that, we'll do it. As a result of this renewed hope that FTX could reach a modestly positive outcome for some people, the FTT token associated with the FTX exchange has caught something of a bid, up 45% from $1.73 on Wednesday to $2.50 at one point on Thursday. Data by YCharts FTT is still a far cry from the $5.43 it commanded when my last article covering the token was published. But the degenerate behavior in FTT right now is very on-brand for a token representing a bankrupt exchange that not too long ago was described as having ""a complete absence of trustworthy financial information."" Why Exchange Tokens Exist The FTT token itself is a simple utility token for an exchange that's bankrupt. What value could those buying FTT on this rip possibly see in FTT? Occam's razor would suggest this is nothing more than gamblers trying to capitalize off a narrative that has surfaced as a result of a headline. That narrative is the possibility that FTX could do business again one day. And if that's the case, FTT would possibly have value again as an exchange token within the platform. I think it's important to understand what tokens like FTT do to grasp why we're seeing the action that we're seeing in FTT today. Owning these exchange tokens generally offers some sort of yield boost on earning accounts or a reduction in transaction fees on a centralized exchange. They're essentially tokenized versions of centralized rewards programs that can be sold in a decentralized market when the user no longer wants to use the centralized exchange associated with the token. Think of it like being able to cash out your Starbucks ( SBUX ) stars through a third party when you decide you want to start getting coffee at Dunkies instead. Stars program (Starbucks.com) There's some credence to the idea that exchange tokens have value at the user level if holding them can create a positive net return on the assets that have been deposited. Having said that, we've generally seen investments in exchange tokens fail to generate that positive return. Purely for the benefit of the example - crypto.com ( CRO-USD ) also has a token that has utility within the ecosystem. That company offers users various yields based on how much CRO has been staked through the platform: Stake payouts (crypto.com) In the example above, you can see it takes $4,000 in CRO tokens to generate $10,530 in USDC ( USDC-USD ) on a $1 million three-month loan. Users are obviously better off buying short term US treasuries. And again, this crypto.com/CRO exercise is used just as an example. But it works because it's a similar platform in a similar business and it's the best we have to go off because so many other crypto yield businesses that offer similar services are also bankrupt. It's highly unlikely that FTT would be able to generate a positive net return in an FTX reboot in my view. So what's really happening here? Don't Be Exit Liquidity The reality is anyone trying to scoop up ""cheap"" FTT is likely doing so without enough information to make a real assessment of any future value FTT could ultimately provide. A bet on FTT today is a bet on four things all happening: FTX does indeed end up getting rebooted Rebooted FTX offers a reward program again FTX uses the old FTT token for said rewards rather than some other mechanism or token launch Users decided to take a chance on FTX again at a meaningful scale despite behaviors of previous management and mountains of bad press. Thus, creating organic demand for FTT. The problem is, we don't know if the first bullet point is even happening. This news of an FTX reboot could theoretically be a tactical move by the bankruptcy team to try to liquidate the FTT that it controls at a better price. FTX Recoveries (restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/) As of Jan. 17, the team overseeing the FTX bankruptcy has recovered approximately $529 million in FTT token. This FTT position has been included in what was initially represented as ""liquid"" crypto assets. The problem with that assertion is that FTT is still a highly centralized token with a top 10 token holder distribution that has actually gotten worse since I last covered the coin - now over 94% of FTT is held by just 10 addresses: Top 10 FTT Addresses (etherscan.io) The point is, FTT is liquid in the sense that it can easily be sold at a market price. The question is what is the market for that coin? Without some level of hope that FTT could have utility once again, I'd wager the market for FTT is virtually non existent - and thus, highly illiquid in reality. After the news of FTX's FTT position was made public earlier this week, FTT first fell from $2.25 down to $1.75 the following day. Justifiably because of the realization that FTX has a large position in the coin and is likely going to try to liquidate it to the degree that it can. Yet here we are with a FTT price back above $2.25. And all it took was a little ""hope"" that FTX could come back. Again, if FTX does end up coming back, we don't know that a future FTX would even be offering anything for holding FTT token. So there might not be any utility on the platform at all for FTT. Furthermore, there's nothing stopping a future version of FTX from issuing an entirely new coin. And even if all of the just mentioned factors do end up favoring FTT holders, we don't know that any users would actually come back to FTX again at all. My money would be on the opposite happening. Summary From where I sit, this renewed interest in FTX as a viable business entity is odd and I don't know who it really serves to attempt a revival of a failed company that has such a publicly negative reputation at this point. As I laid out above, I wouldn't rule out the possibility that this announcement is actually more of a strategic move on the part of the FTX bankruptcy team to try to get some capital out of the FTT token as part of asset liquidations.

42413056,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7coi,1674234063,"Sullivan & Cromwell Gets Go-Ahead to Represent FTX in Bankruptcy Proceedings, Despite Controversy","A bankruptcy court judge in Delaware has given New York law firm Sullivan & Cromwell the green light to continue representing FTX during its bankruptcy proceedings.  The decision, issued on Friday morning by Judge John T. Dorsey, comes despite recent controversy about the white-shoe law firm having potential conflicts of interest that critics say should disqualify Sullivan & Cromwell from acting as debtors’ counsel.  Late Thursday evening, former FTX attorney Daniel Friedberg – who served as the now-defunct exchange’s chief regulatory officer – filed an unorthodox declaration that contained numerous bombshell allegations of wrongdoing in Sullivan & Cromwell’s previous work with FTX.  In his declaration, Friedberg alleged that Ryne Miller – FTX US’ general counsel and a former partner at Sullivan & Cromwell – funneled millions of dollars in legal work back to his ex-colleagues. The relationship between Miller and Sullivan & Cromwell was not initially disclosed by the law firm, leading the U.S. Trustee’s Office to file an objection to the appointment of Sullivan & Cromwell as debtors’ counsel on Jan. 13.  Friedberg and the U.S. Trustee’s Office are not the only ones that question Sullivan & Cromwell putting its finger in the FTX pie.  On Jan. 10, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators sent a letter to Judge Dorsey urging him to appoint an independent examiner and to question Sullivan & Cromwell’s involvement. The senators pointed out that there were “significant questions about the firm’s involvement in operations of FTX” and “put bluntly, the firm is simply not in a position to uncover the information needed to ensure confidence in any investigation or findings.”  Disgraced former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has also questioned Sullivan & Cromwell’s role in the bankruptcy process, making dubious claims in a recent Substack post that FTX US was solvent at the time the company filed for bankruptcy protection. He previously claimed that Sullivan & Cromwell wrongfully pressured him to allow FTX to file for bankruptcy.  Judge Dorsey, however, was not moved by the mounting concerns over Sullivan & Cromwell’s appointment as debtor’s counsel. He previously dismissed the senators’ letter as “inappropriate” and, on Friday, described Friedberg’s declaration as “full of hearsay, innuendo, speculation and rumors.”  After a brief recess to allow him to consider the arguments, Judge Dorsey handed down his decision to approve Sullivan & Cromwell’s appointment as debtors’ counsel.  “There’s no evidence of any actual conflict here,” Dorsey said. “Any potential conflicts are ameliorated by the fact that there’s conflicts counseling in place – that’s something that happens in every large bankruptcy case.”  “This is what we call a super-mega case,” Dorsey added. “Even in a mega case, or a large case, it would be difficult to find debtors’ counsel that didn’t have other clients who might be clients of the Debtors’ counsel.”  ‘Fighting with a ghost’  Of all the criticism that has been lobbed at Sullivan & Cromwell, which is earning $2,000 an hour for its work on the case, accusations by Bankman-Fried seemed to most rankle the firm’s lead attorney on the case, New York-based partner James Bromley.  “One of the things that the debtors have been facing in these [FTX bankruptcy] cases is assault by Twitter,” Bromley said. “It’s very difficult, Your Honor, to cross-examine a tweet – particularly tweets that are being issued by individuals who are under criminal indictment and whose travel is restricted.”  “Those who have things to say should come to court and say those things,” Bromley added.  Bromley expressed frustration with Bankman-Fried’s numerous claims on social media, adding that dealing with him was like “fighting a ghost” and insinuating that Bankman-Fried’s machinations were to blame for the controversy around Sullivan & Cromwell’s appointment.  “Mr. Bankman-Fried is behind all of this,” Bromley said. “And wherever we move this … in my mind, there is absolute certainty that he’s going to try to do something to get in the way. He’s lashing out.”  Friedberg’s ‘checkered past’  Bromley also attempted to characterize Friedberg – who he described as a member of FTX’s “inner circle” – as a shady character (before his role at FTX, Friedberg was allegedly tied to a massive poker cheating scandal).  “Mr. Friedberg – I have to say he’s got a checkered past,” Bromley told the court. “It takes a lot of guts for him to put something in writing that says ‘I was the chief compliance officer at FTX.’”  Bromley described Friedberg’s declaration as nothing more than an “incendiary device” thrown into the bankruptcy process.  “If you’re part of the inner circle at FTX – and that would include Mr. Friedberg – then you have concern about the exercise that’s going on … [T[he individuals who were up and running and making the decisions that have brought this company to its knees are rightly concerned that the information that is being provided to authorities could lead back to their doorstep,” Bromley said.  “So what we have here, Your Honor, is a gentleman who ran this company into the ground – Mr. Bankman-Fried – sitting in his parents’ home in Palo Alto, California, with an ankle bracelet on after being extradited from the Bahamas and charged with multiple crimes … So if you’re Mr. Bankman-Fried or, frankly, Mr. Friedberg, there’s a concern about what’s going on and what could happen to them,” Bromley continued.  “They can’t throw stones at the U.S. Attorney’s Office, but they can throw stones at debtors’ counsel that’s providing information to the prosecutors and the regulators,” Bromley added. “And that’s exactly what’s happening.”  UPDATE (Jan. 20, 18:09 UTC): Added additional information and context throughout.

7812026,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516926,1674234051,Bullish Indicator: Bitcoin Shakes Off Genesis Bankruptcy Filing,"Bitcoin has not moved as expected despite the news of Genesis, one of the largest crypto lenders in the world, filing for bankruptcy. This lack of negative movement from bitcoin in response to the news could cement the digital asset’s path to the upside in the coming weeks. Bitcoin Remains Unfazed By Genesis Despite the dreaded news of a Genesis bankruptcy finally becoming a reality, the price of bitcoin has not reacted negatively. In fact, the digital asset has barely responded to the news at all and continues to trade around the $20,900 level. What this shows is that the news of the Genesis bankruptcy was already priced into the price of the asset. It is understandable given that the crypto lender had been considering filing for bankruptcy for quite some time and has been exploring its options. So it makes sense that the bias and fear that such news would carry has already been digested by participants in the space. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price: Investors Predict 12% Decline For BTC In Next Two Weeks For bitcoin, this suggests that the price of the digital asset is where it is supposed to be. Given that its current price level appears to be a fair price, then there is more support for the current bull rally. It also means that to trigger another downtrend for BTC, it would have to be a true market-disrupting event. A deep pullback from a market correction becomes even more unlikely with this news. This means that a fall below $20,000 could be farther away than the bears would like, putting the cryptocurrency in a position for more upside rather than decline. BTC sees upside despite Genesis bankruptcy filing | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com BTC Investors Look To Expiring Options On Friday, over $580 million in bitcoin options are expected to expire, and while this would normally be a cause for celebration for the bears, BTC’s continued strong performance would make this a win for the bulls who stand to gain more from the market. Even though there are some who expect inflation to get worse, an example being JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, there is a slowdown for now, which has reduced the pressure on bitcoin and the general crypto market at this point. With the easing inflation, risk assets are seeing a better performance, increasing the chances of a price recovery rather than a decline from here.

This at the very least solidifies bullish momentum for the digital asset for the mid-term. Additionally, there is ample support for BTC just above $20,500 which serves as a deterrent to bears in the meantime. If BTC holds through the weekend, then a solid move above $21,000 can be expected next week. The price of BTC is changing hands at $20,949 at the time of this writing. It is up 1% in the last 24 hours and seeing a significant upside of 10.34% in the last seven days, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

42413062,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7cpe,1674233734,Genesis Claims $5.1B in Liabilities in First-Day Bankruptcy Filing,"Crypto lending firm Genesis held $5.1 billion in liabilities in the weeks following its freeze on withdrawals last November, according to bankruptcy court documents signed by interim CEO Derar Islim.  In his first-day motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, Islim provided a breakdown of Genesis’ financial state heading into its restructuring. Genesis became the latest crypto firm caught up in the immediate fallout of FTX’s implosion, with three of its entities – Genesis HoldCo, Genesis Global Capital LLC and Genesis Asia Pacific PTE. LTD – filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late Thursday.  Those entities were perhaps less affected by direct losses to FTX and sister company Alameda than by the “run on the bank” that Islim said their collapse sparked. Customers demanded Genesis repay $827 million in loans, forcing its lending units to freeze withdrawals.  “At the same time, Holdco’s corporate parent, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its various subsidiaries, including DCG International Investments Ltd., were also impacted by the market turmoil and did not have the liquidity to pay back the Company on certain loans, adding pressure to the Debtors’ balance sheets,” Islim said. (DCG is also the parent of CoinDesk.)  At least part of the liquidity crunch began months earlier thanks to Genesis’ $1.2 billion loss to crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), which collapsed in the summer of 2022. That loss came out of the Genesis Asia Pacific unit (that also filed for bankruptcy), which managed Genesis’ lending relationship with 3AC. At the time of 3AC going under, Genesis had $2.4 billion in outstanding loans to the fund, of which Genesis was able to recover just half, according to the filing.  DCG last year assumed much of that exposure, swapping a 10-year promissory note in exchange for Genesis’ $1.2 billion in claims against 3AC. That note is now at the center of DCG’s public spat with crypto exchange Gemini over the exchange’s yield product Earn, with Gemini being Genesis’ largest creditor at more than $700 million.  Read more: Cameron Winklevoss Threatens Legal Action Against DCG CEO After Genesis Bankruptcy  Islim said the bankruptcy proceedings “incentivize all stakeholders to move expeditiously toward a consensual resolution that avoids the costs and uncertainty of litigation.”  Genesis continues to operate most of its non-lending businesses, Islim said. That includes its derivatives, trading and custody wings, all of which are held in separate legal entities that did not file for bankruptcy.  Prior to the collapses of FTX and 3AC, the initial major domino in this crypto death spiral was the implosion of the terraUSD (UST)-luna ecosystem in May, with that algorithmic stablecoin’s demise vaporizing tens of billions of dollars in capital. Genesis now joins BlockFi, Voyager and Celsius and others whose bankruptcy can be traced back to that event.  “The collapse of luna and UST and subsequent liquidation of 3AC signaled the onset of a new ‘crypto winter’ and a growing industry-wide reluctance to do business with digital asset companies,” Islim said.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/20/genesis-claims-51b-in-liabilities-in-first-day-bankruptcy-filing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/550fb1207dea59dde01258edbf8557040d865224-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Genesis owes over $3.5 billion to its top 50 creditors – and one of the creditors has ties to a $6.8 billion pension fund system in Fairfax County, Virginia.  The list of creditors in the bankruptcy filing included the New Finance Income Fund from global asset manager VanEck with a $53 million claim against Genesis. The fund launched in December 2021 with a strategy of forming short-term lending arrangements with digital-asset entities to achieve high yields, according to VanEck’s website.  Last July, VanEck made headlines when two of the funds in the $6.8 billion Fairfax pension system – the Fairfax County Employees’ Retirement System and the Fairfax County Police Officers Retirement System – invested a combined $35 million in the VanEck fund as part of a then-new yield strategy, which also included an investment in Parataxis Capital.  The Fairfax County Police Officers Retirement System, which is led by Chief Investment Officer Katherine Molnar and which was managing about $1.8 billion as of last summer, has invested in the crypto industry since 2019 – a notable and extremely rare step for pension funds. Prior investments have included a $50 million commitment in Morgan Creek Capital’s blockchain fund.  Molnar didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

7810332,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516905,1674230403,Sell Pressure Mounts On Bitcoin As Miners Offload More BTC,"CryptoQuant data on January 20 shows an unusually sharp spike in Bitcoin miners’ outflow, an unexpected development considering the solid performance of BTC prices in the past few trading days. Miners’ Position Index (MPI) Rising The Miners’ Position Index (MPI) is up from -0.85 registered on December 31, 2022, to +3.25 on January 19, 2023. The expansion could indicate that miners are moving their coins, at a faster pace, to centralized exchanges. The MPI is a moving ratio between the total miner outflows to the total one-year moving average of the total miner outflows. All denominations are in USD. Per CryptoQuant’s interpretation, the higher the MPI ratio, the higher the odds that miners are sending mined coins to centralized exchanges, heightening the risks of a price plunge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Show Signs Of Dumping, Bad For Rally? For a wholesome picture, it is recommended that the MPI be used with other metrics since there are assumptions that miners are expressly selling their coins in top exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or even in over-the-counter (OTC) exchanges. Nonetheless, when used with different technical indicators, MPI flows can provide a rough indicator of Bitcoin miners’ financial state. The actions of the miners may provide an indication of where the market might be headed next. In proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin, miners are compensated with coins to secure the platform against external attacks and confirm transactions. Bitcoin distributes 6.25 BTC for every block they successfully mine. This translates to around $131,000 in BTC. A block is released roughly every 10 minutes. The price of Bitcoin explains the higher interest from miners compared to other proof-of-work networks like Litecoin. With a hash rate of 275 EH/s as of January 20, Bitcoin remains the most secure blockchain by this metric. Bitcoin Miners Have to Sell Miners have to expend energy and buy gear and this is why they are said to be mandatory sellers. Miners, therefore, have to move coins to crypto exchanges for cash to pay for services such as electricity or chipset manufacturers to remain competitive. Since the Bitcoin network is transparent and all movements can be tracked, dedicated analytics’ platforms and traders often monitor their activities. Recent data points to these miners moving coins, possibly to exchanges for cash. The spike from -0.85 to +3.25 coincides with the stalling of Bitcoin prices below $21,500. This retracement follows a sharp expansion that saw the coin power above $20,000 with increasing participation levels, as trading volumes show. Related Reading: Most Public Crypto Firms Underperformed Bitcoin In 2022, Miners Hit Worst Analysts said the revival is because of shifting macroeconomic factors, especially in the United States, and recent data shows that inflation is falling and labor conditions are firming after the effects of COVID-19.

According to CoinGecko, the token is up 55% in the weekly timeframe with the biggest gains made during the monthly time frame at 105%. With 2023 showing a renewed interest in crypto, Decentraland has a lot to unpack this month for users, traders, and investors as they released their manifesto detailing plans to improve user experience and making it easier for creators to enter the world of the metaverse with ease. Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration The Decentraland Manifesto The Decentraland team recently posted on their blog about how this year would be the “Year of Creators.” According to Decentraland, it will continue its mission it set itself from the start of 2017: to establish a decentralized platform where users can help build and grow. The blog post said: “Decentraland, anyone can extend the capabilities of the virtual world’s platform, audit it, contribute to it, and build on top of it—all the code is open source. To that end, in 2023 Decentraland will continue to be developed as a public good in the era of the internet.” Image: Decentraland.org The manifesto detailed several goals that the ecosystem wants to achieve this year. Namely, the developers aim to achieve a better environment for creators, to make Decentraland more fun, and to make the performance of the ecosystem better. This would drive the platform to become a dominant player in the metaverse space. In the 18 months since its birth, Decentraland’s DAO has developed into a basic decision-making system for high-level deliberations concerning the Decentraland ecosystem and the metaverse in general. In order to address the growing demand for governance and stewardship of progressive decentralization, the DAO’s procedures and processes have continued to expand with the community’s increasing self-governance experience and strength, according to the manifesto. What Does This Mean For MANA? As the time of writing, MANA is changing hands at $0.6210 with the token being rejected at $0.7567. This led to the token retesting its current support at $0.6352 which, if broken, could lead the bears to test further support ranges in the next few days or weeks. If the token buckles under the rejection, we might see MANA at $0.5397 support which could easily be breached. However, with the detailed roadmap provided by the devs, MANA will have a strong enough investor sentiment that it will retest $0.7567 once the rejection reaches its bottom. MANA total market cap at $1.1 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration Investors and traders should brace for short to mid term volatility as the token tries to consolidate above $0.6352. If MANA bulls are successful in entrenching the token above $0.6352, investors and traders will have another chance to target $0.7567 or higher.

42413085,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7d6U,1674225311,Crypto Analysts Warn Against Shorting DYDX Ahead of $200M Token Unlock,"Perpetuals-focused decentralized exchange dYdx is set to unlock 150 million or about $200 million worth of its native token, DYDX, on Feb. 2, which could be a potential shorting opportunity for traders. The supply release, however, isn't necessarily bearish, some analysts said, cautioning against making short bets in the derivative market tied to the cryptocurrency.  ""While the upcoming token unlocks will give venture capitalists who invested in the project access to part of their token allocation, the market feels they will more likely hold instead of sell, continuing to show support for DYDX and signaling their commitment to the community that they are here for the long term,"" said Charles Storry, head of growth at Phuture, a crypto index platform.  Token unlocks refer to the process of releasing tokens blocked under the terms of the project's funding rounds or fundraising efforts. According to CoinGecko, the supply of DYDX will be fully unlocked by September 2026.  Activity in decentralized exchanges like dYdX and GMX, offering perpetual futures, has picked up pace since the collapse of centralized derivatives giant FTX. Trading volume on dYdX increased to $2.9 billion on Jan. 14, according to data from Nomics, after reaching a low of $212 million following FTX’s unfolding. Perpetuals are futures contracts that don't have an expiration date. That allows traders, both bulls and bears, to hold their long/short positions as long as they like.  “DeFi (decentralized-finance) investors see perpetual contracts growing in popularity and feel that the market will favor companies in the space,” Storry added.  Move from CeFi to DeFi?  The shift from centralized to decentralized derivatives exchanges is likely to gather speed this year amid collapse of some centralized exchanges such as FTX.  “Decentralized derivatives and perpetual exchanges are another area in DeFi that is poised for growth this year,” CryptoCompare said in its 2023 outlook.  “The rise of GMX has been fascinating to watch in the second half of 2022. Since then, several newer derivatives exchanges have launched including Gains Network and Perpetual Protocol, and will be competing with GMX to take the throne off dYdX, which is currently the largest decentralized derivatives exchange. These exchanges have seen an increase in user base since the collapse of FTX,” CryptoCompare added.  Overcrowded trade  Crypto trader and analyst Miles Deutscher said in a tweet that, ahead of the dYdX unlock, it’s better to be net long than short, because shorting is becoming a “crowded trade.”  A crowded trade is a popular position – bullish or bearish – based on a theme favored by many investors. Such extreme positioning almost always presages trend reversals.  David Scheuermann, a trader at Crypto Finance AG, said, however, that “this is a dangerous move in a market where there’s a lot of upward momentum,” referring to the widespread shorting of tokens ahead of the unlock.  “Teams of projects are not oblivious to the impact large token unlocks can have on the price of their coin. They can’t stop investors from selling, but they may choose to release good news around the unlock to increase buying,” Scheuermann noted.  The wider crypto market has also seen an uptick over the last month, following the downfall in prices after crypto exchange FTX collapsed. Bitcoin (BTC) has gained 25% over the last month, pushing its market cap up to $404 billion. Bitcoin’s market cap dipped to $319 billion following the downfall of FTX.  Over the last month, the DYDX token has been trading between $1.12 and $1.58. At press time, the token was trading at $1.40, according to CoinDesk data.  “I think the considerable uptick in price has definitely been driven by some of the more recent upward moves in the major tokens,” said Christopher Newhouse, a crypto derivatives trader at GSR, a crypto market maker and trading firm.  Scheuermann voiced a similar opinion, saying the positive price action across the market has flushed out shorts initiated in December.  ""On January 9, when DYDX was trading at $1.32, more than $1m worth of DYDX short positions were liquidated, pushing the price even higher. Open Interest has come down significantly since the end of December/beginning of January,"" he said.

7807686,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516865,1674225016,"XRP Vs. Cardano (ADA), Which Is The Better Investment In 2023?","Cardano (ADA) and XRP are popular entry-level investments in the crypto market due to their low prices below $1. But what are the prospects for both altcoins in 2023? We’ll take a look at the fundamentals as well as the technical analysis perspective. XRP Prediction 2023 The success of the XRP price this year could largely depend on the outcome of the court case between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If Ripple manages to leave the courtroom as the winner, the price could skyrocket. According to current projections, including from Ripple’s legal counsel Stuart Alderoty, the trial could likely end in the second quarter of 2023. A Ripple victory could trigger a reverse effect on the XRP price as of December 2020. The week the SEC filed its lawsuit, the XRP price fell a whopping -72% in seven days. The price crashed from $0.60 to $0.17. Compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP still shows a massive undervaluation since the event. While BTC and ETH are 69% and 68% down from their all-time highs, respectively, the current XRP price is 88% below its all-time high of $3.40. Thus, XRP bulls will be eager to make up for this shortfall. A Ripple victory could reactivate old and new partnerships. During the Ripple Swell conference in November, CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that U.S. banks and companies are in the pipeline as partners once the court case is out of the way, as Bitcoinist reported. Related Reading: XRP Bulls Aim For $1 As Crypto Advances With 12% Weekly Pump Garlinghouse said, among other things: “Bank of America is a huge partner of Ripple,” and went on to explain that “Bank of America stands to gain really big when the settlement happens because they are gonna have a huge competitive advantage over their competitors by using ODL and the marketplace.” Also, Ripple’s partnership with MoneyGram, which was stalled by the SEC’s lawsuit, could get a new chance. Ripple had already bought shares in MoneyGram amounting to about 10% before the lawsuit. Due to the SEC lawsuit, both partners amicably ended the partnership and agreed to leave all options open for a new collaboration at a “later” date. Also bullish could be the relisting of XRP on U.S. exchanges like Coinbase, where trading was suspended because of the SEC. At the same time, a Ripple loss against the SEC could nullify the positive catalysts for the XRP price, and cause a massive dump. A look at the 1-week chart of XRP shows that the price is currently stuck below the resistance zone at $0.40. Once broken, XRP bulls could target the breakout above $0.60 before the magical $1 price will be the main goal. Should XRP crush this price as well, the $2 mark would be the next big target, which proved to be an unbreakable resistance in April 2021. Cardano (ADA) Prediction 2023 The Cardano (ADA) price is also 89% below its all-time high of $3.09, which was reached in September 2021. This year, there are major updates in store for the Cardano ecosystem that could impact the ADA price. The community is currently eagerly awaiting the launch of the layer-2 scaling solution Hydra, which is expected to massively increase transaction throughput and make Cardano one of the fastest blockchains on the market with one million transactions per second (TPS). In addition, Cardano will see the launch of the stablecoin Djed. This could also be significant for the Cardano DeFi ecosystem. Related Reading: Cardano Up 30% Since December As 28 New Whales Hold At least 1 Million ADA In general, the size of Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem still lags far behind that of Ethereum and other major blockchains. Therefore, the growth of this sector will likely be one of the most important factors for the ADA price. Another important project for 2023 is Cardano’s own privacy sidechain called “Midnight.” The developers have already been working on this project in secret for several months. It is supposed to be a sidechain of Cardano that will have its own token called “DUST” and anonymously executable smart contracts. The 1-week chart of Cardano (ADA) shows that the price has managed to break out of the downtrend that has been persisting since April, with a retest currently underway. Should ADA bounce up from this descending trendline, the $0.69 level would be the next major hurdle. Subsequently, Cardano (ADA) might be able to tackle the psychologically important $1.00 level. Which Is Better: XRP Or Cardano (ADA)? XRP and Cardano (ADA) show similar price behavior over the last two years and have great upside potential due to their strong fundamentals. However, given the unpredictable outcome of the court battle between the SEC and Ripple, XRP has a slightly higher investment risk.

Investors included venture arms of crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and stablecoin issuer Circle. Centralized exchange FTX collapsed in November after a CoinDesk report triggered a liquidity crisis that in turn shook the confidence of investors and slowed venture-capital investments.  Architect’s software will make both decentralized and centralized exchanges easier to use for investors with the aim of helping “people to get their confidence back in trading in this industry,” Harrison, who left FTX.US in September after about a year in the job, told Bloomberg.  The product is expected to launch in the second quarter, and Harrison expects Architect to become integrated into the platforms of investors Coinbase and Circle.  Other investors in the funding round included financier Anthony Scaramucci, a former White House aide to former U.S. President Donald Trump, and SALT Fund (managed by his son, AJ Scaramucci), SV Angel, Third Kind Venture Capital and Motivate Venture Capital, among others  In December, The Information reported that Harrison was looking to raise $6 million for Architect at a $60 million valuation. Harrison had tweeted on Jan. 14 that Architect was struggling to raise funds because of his past association with FTX. However, a couple of the investors who participated had their own ties to the fallen exchange. FTX previously purchased a 30% stake in Scaramucci’s hedge fund, SkyBridge Capital, and participated in Circle’s $440 million fundraising round in 2021. FTX and Circle had small equity stakes in each other.  Harrison spoke out against FTX and founder Sam Bankman-Fried during a Twitter thread last week.  “It’s clear from what has been made public that the scheme was held closely by Sam and his inner circle at FTX. com and Alameda, which I was not a part of, nor were other executives at FTX.US,” Harrison wrote. “I understand now why they carefully concealed their criminal activity from us.

The three entities that filed for bankruptcy protection are holding company Genesis Global Holdco (GGH), lender Genesis Global Capital (GGC) and Genesis Asia Pacific (GAP).  DCG's debt to Genesis includes loans of $575 million due in May of this year and a $1.1 billion promissory note due June 2032, according to a Friday declaration filed with the bankruptcy court of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) from Paul Aronzon, a member of a special committee of the board of directors of GGH, the holding company of the Genesis entities.  DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk.  The special committee is investigating the lending activities between GGC and DCG in order to determine whether the bankrupt companies have any viable claims against DCG related to these transactions that could help with the restructuring. The probe is being conducted by law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP – which represents Genesis in the proceedings – led by Lev Dassin, a former Acting U.S. Attorney for the SDNY.  Specifically, the focus of the investigation is: ""GGC’s lending of approximately $850 million in unsecured loans to the DCG Entities, the DCG [promissory] note, various transactions that restructured the $850 million in unsecured loans in November 2022, DCG’s purported exercise of a $52.5 million set-off in November 2022, the treatment"" of the DCG note by GGC and DCG entities ""for accounting and other purposes and related communications with lenders, dividends paid by the Debtors [GGC, GGH, and GAP] to DCG, and other conduct between the DCG Entities and the Company.""  The committee is also investigating potential avoidance actions and types of actions concerning DCG entities, Gemini Trust Company, LLC, and other Genesis lenders. An avoidance action means the debtors will look to avoid or nullify certain fund transfers they made before they filed for Chapter 11 protection.  Thursday's filings are the latest in a saga of high-profile collapses that have shaken the crypto industry over the past year, including the Terra implosion and, more recently, the FTX crypto exchange's failure.  Genesis found itself entwined with hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and crypto exchange FTX, both of which later failed. Shortly after FTX's Chapter 11 filing in November Genesis was forced to suspend withdrawals in its lending unit, a major customer of which was Gemini, the crypto exchange owed by brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. CEO Cameron Winklevoss has since waged a public campaign against Genesis, DCG and its CEO, Barry Silbert.  Prior to the Chapter 11 filings, Genesis had been trying to raise fresh capital or reach a deal with creditors. The bankruptcy papers show the company owed $3.5 billion to its top 50 creditors.

Called Ecosystem Vault, the project is an on-chain fund financed by 10% of the transaction fees on Fantom and controlled by the community. The initiative was made possible by decreasing the burn rate of FTM and redirecting the resulting 10% to the vault.  CoinDesk previously reported on Fantom’s community governance decision to fund ecosystem projects using a portion of the fees.  “The Vault represents a valuable opportunity for projects to secure funding in their efforts to build innovative dApps on Fantom,” developers said. “It’s also a chance for the Fantom community to come together and shape the future of the platform through their funding decisions.”  Token burning means removing coins from the overall supply of a cryptocurrency by sending those tokens to a wallet that can only receive them.  Any proposal must receive at least 55% approval from the community to be funded, with at least 55% of FTM stakers in attendance. For the initial launch of the Vault, there will be only five projects receiving payments at any one time.  Payments will initially be executed manually via the Fantom Foundation, using tools such as LlamaPay, to fund projects whose proposals are approved by the Ecosystem Vault.

42414604,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBC8AL,1674222824,Objectors to FTX Using Sullivan & Cromwell as Its Law Firm Seek to Delay Court Hearing,"Several parties to crypto exchange FTX's bankruptcy case who are objecting to crypto exchange FTX hiring the New York law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell are seeking to delay a hearing that's scheduled for 10 a.m. on Friday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.  The hearing is expected to be about whether FTX can retain Sullivan & Cromwell amid allegations from Andrew Vera, the U.S. trustee in the case, that the hiring presents a conflict of interest. At least two FTX customers and FTX's former counsel have filed similar objections.  Vera said that FTX’s general counsel, Ryne Miller, previously worked at Sullivan & Cromwell for eight years, adding that this nondisclosure makes it ""wholly insufficient to evaluate whether S&C satisfies the Bankruptcy Code’s conflict-free and disinterestedness standards.""  Warren Winter and Richard Brummond, two FTX customers, submitted an emergency motion on Thursday to delay Friday's hearing in response to latest revelations from former top FTX attorney Daniel Friedberg, who opposed FTX hiring Sullivan & Cromwell, citing similar conflicts of interest.  Friedberg said that Miller had told him ""it was very important for him [Miller] personally to channel a lot of business to S&C as he wanted to return there as a partner after his stint at the debtors.""  Friedberg's filing also alleges that Miller stated he needed to include FTX.US as part of the bankruptcy because FTX.US had the cash to pay Sullivan & Cromwell its retainer.  Miller didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  The complaints about Sullivan & Cromwell echoes those made by FTX’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, last week. In a blog post, Bankman-Fried said Sullivan & Cromwell's relationship with FTX prior to the crypto exchange's downfall was more than purely transactional and that the law firm's staff had pressured him into filing for bankruptcy in November.  Friedberg also said that Sullivan & Cromwell has repeatedly refused to waive his attorney-client privilege in order to help law enforcement and that this is ""totally inappropriate.""  John Ray III, FTX's current CEO, however supports the defunct exchange hiring Sullivan & Cromwell, saying in December that it ""is one of the leading law firms in the world in all of the key practice areas.”  In a fresh declaration, Ray said if the retention of the lawyers were to be denied ""the interest of the debtors’ customers and creditors, as well as the state and federal regulators and prosecutors with whom these advisors engage on a daily basis, would be severely, if not irreparably harmed.""  A spokesperson for Sullivan & Cromwell referred to a statement from Andrew Dietderich, an attorney at the firm, on Jan. 17 without further comment. In the statement, Dietderich said that Bankman-Fried's claim that Sullivan & Cromwell had pressured FTX into filing for bankruptcy was ""false.""

42414612,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBC8lU,1674222475,Craig Wright’s Blacklist Resembles Bitcoin ‘Kill Switch’ Satoshi Never Followed Through On,"Bitcoiners are cringing at the fact that users of the rival Bitcoin SV (BSV) blockchain can now freeze and confiscate other users’ coins, thanks to the Australian computer scientist Craig Wright’s “blacklist manager” – a software tool for recovering lost or stolen coins. But did Satoshi Nakamoto, inventor of Bitcoin, suggest a similar “kill switch” feature 13 years ago?  In a 2010 Bitcoin Talk post, Satoshi described a system that would allow a buyer to lock up bitcoin in an escrow account. The money would be unlocked once the buyer confirmed receipt of goods or services. The buyer could never retract the funds (although the seller could always refund the bitcoin). But here’s the catch – the buyer could keep the coins locked indefinitely (something like a kill switch targeting fraudulent sellers).  BSV unveiled its blacklist manager in October. The tool allows users to freeze and confiscate BSV coins as long as they provide legal documents proving rightful ownership. Many see this as an affront to the ethos of decentralization and censorship resistance. But BSV proponents claim the blacklist manager aligns with Satoshi’s old escrow idea.  “It is not so far away from Satoshi as some may think,” wrote Twitter user Wolfgang Lohmann, a BSV advocate.  Read more: Craig Wright Signals He's Given Up Convincing Courts He Invented Bitcoin  What Lohmann is referring to is the comparison between BSV’s digital asset recovery process and the concept Satoshi floated in that old escrow discussion.  “Imagine someone stole something from you. You can't get it back, but if you could, if it had a kill switch that could be remote[ly] triggered, would you do it?” Satoshi wrote in the Bitcoin Talk post. “Would it be a good thing for thieves to know that everything you own has a kill switch and if they steal it, it'll be useless to them, although you still lose it too? If they give it back, you can reactivate it.”  Wright, who purports to be Satoshi, has claimed he found himself in the situation Satoshi described. In February 2020, Wright alleged hackers used a Wi-Fi pineapple to steal private keys from him for two bitcoin (BTC) wallets. A Wi-Fi pineapple is a special device used by malicious actors to intercept messages between a computer and a Wi-Fi network.  One of the wallets Wright claims to own – the 1Feex wallet – is well-known and holds nearly 80,000 BTC. The wallet was funded during the Mt. Gox debacle – a series of hacks between 2011 and 2014 that forced Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, into bankruptcy. The other wallet has roughly 31,000 BTC.  Wright filed a claim against 16 developers of Bitcoin and its various forks in 2021, insisting they owe Tulip Trading, a Seychelles company owned by Wright and the official claimant in the case, “fiduciary and tortious duties” to “re-write or amend” protocol code in order to give Tulip Trading access to the 111,000 BTC controlled by the two wallets.  Read more: Craig Wright Demands Bitcoin Developers Give Him Access to Stolen Mt. Gox Coins  This bizarre demand to amend protocol code seemed to contradict basic cryptography and left many scratching their heads. How could developers give Wright access to coins whose private keys are unknown?  Enter BSV’s blacklist manager, which, according to court documents, Wright's other company, nChain, had been working on all along.  “The first step of the digital asset freezing process is obtaining a court order or a document of equivalent legal force,” states a video explainer on the official BSV website. “The plaintiff commissions a ‘notary’ who can operate a ‘notary tool.’ The notary converts the court order into a machine readable format and transmits it to the mining network.”  This type of transaction is called a “confiscation transaction” and according to the video, the end result is that miners “will receive legal documents ordering the reassignment of misappropriated or lost assets and execute a transaction that transfers ownership of coins to their legally determined owner.”  According to BSV’s press release, the network wants digital assets to receive the same legal treatment as traditional assets.  For blockchain technology to be adopted globally, it needs digital assets to be treated legally similarly to stocks, bonds and any other property,” the release states, quoting Marcin Zarakowski, general counsel and chief of staff of the Bitcoin Association for BSV.  “In the past two years, we have seen $3 billion-plus in digital assets stolen; this is unacceptable. With this new tool, we look to set ourselves on the right track for solving this issue,” the statement reads.  While such a tool may seem reasonable at first, it doesn’t take much to poke holes into the concept of a court-mediated network. For example, how would disputes between users in different jurisdictions be handled?  On the other hand, many members of society may prefer a system bound by law to one beholden to computer code and a strict decentralization ethos.  For what it’s worth, it doesn’t seem Satoshi ever implemented an escrow or kill switch feature. He may have been just brainstorming before realizing the inevitable tradeoff between decentralization and financial insurance.  “This is not implemented and I probably won't have time to implement it soon, but just to let you know what's possible,” Satoshi wrote.  He did however, create an “alert system” where “power users” (like Satoshi) could send network-wide alerts and even disable transactions, Satoshi deprecated it in December 2010 and it was completely removed between 2016 and 2017.  “I see nothing to indicate that the alert system was intended for anything other than to broadcast a message to all node operators,” Bob Summerwill told CoinDesk. Summerwill is a long-time member of the Ethereum developer community and executive director for the ETC Cooperative. “[There was] never any indication that it was intended for asset freezing or recovery.”  Summerwill also pointed out that Ethereum had a similar system involving canary contracts – code that allowed core developers to stop certain operations or transactions. Canary contracts were removed from Ethereum (due to centralization concerns) after the Homestead upgrade in 2016.  Bitcoin SV’s decision to allow these “confiscation transactions” highlights the trade-offs that certain blockchains have made when balancing the goals of decentralization, censorship resistance and the enforceability of legal property rights.  So is Wright really following Satoshi’s vision, or is he simply trying to cash in on a 111,000 BTC fortune?  “It cannot be coincidental that CSW [Craig Steven Wright] claims that billions were stolen from him in the nonsensical pineapple hack, and that he is the only individual in the world trying to get a court to ‘return’ those assets while BSV [is] the only chain in the world implementing confiscation transactions,” Summerwill said. “It is so against the spirit of Bitcoin.”",NEGATIVE,BTC | BSV,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION | BSV,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/20/craig-wrights-blacklist-resembles-bitcoin-kill-switch-satoshi-never-followed-through-on,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c0e465571844bc9d50049970dabb1ef591a3e95-5019x3346.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This would entitle users to opt-in of the MOBILE rewards system. This system rewards users for sharing data about Helium’s dead spots location in the United States which would help them save on cellular data plans. The public beta launch of the rewards system will launch during the 1st quarter this year. Image: Securities.io Helium and Solana’s merge event will also happen at the same timeframe. The upgrade would enable the ecosystem to give more back to hotspot owners as 2 million HNT would be allocated annually for rewards. It would also make the network faster and reliable as the proof-of-coverage system of Helium gets buffed. What Does This Mean For HNT? As of writing, the token faced a rejection at $3.4 with the bears trying to reach the $2.8 support line. The first few months of this year could set up HNT for greater heights as the rewards system and the merge of Solana and Helium happens at nearly the same time. With the token’s price at $2.9, HNT is expected to face challenges in the short to medium term as volatility enters the market.

In its filing, Genesis Global Capital, the partner firm of Gemini's defunct interest-bearing Earn program, estimated it has more than 100,000 creditors and between $1 billion and $10 billion in liabilities, as well as assets. Genesis owes over $3.5 billion to its top 50 creditors, including crypto exchange Gemini, trading giant Cumberland, investment firm Mirana, MoonAlpha Finance and VanEck’s New Finance Income Fund. Genesis and CoinDesk are both owned by Digital Currency Group, or DCG.  Gemini CEO Cameron Winklevoss threatened to sue DCG CEO Barry Silbert over the repayment of a $900 million loan in a tweet published just minutes after Genesis filed for Chapter 11. The tweet comes after Winklevoss waged a Twitter war against DCG to recover the loan amid his exchange’s own struggles. Winklevoss called Genesis' bankruptcy a “crucial step” toward recovering Gemini users’ assets. But he still intends to sue Silbert and Genesis’ parent company, DCG, unless Silbert makes a ""fair offer"" to DCG's creditors.  Bitcoin rose 1% to around $21,000 over the past 24 hours after the Genesis bankruptcy news hit the wires. Ether rose 2% to $1,545, CoinDesk data shows. Traders weren’t surprised by bitcoin's and ether's resilience following the news. “The market appeared to expect the Genesis bankruptcy filing for the last 48 hours as the GBTC discount suddenly widened again. With Genesis filing for bankruptcy, this removes a negative overhang from the market, and crypto investors can finally focus on fundamentals,"" Markus Thielen, head of strategy and research at crypto-services provider Matrixport, said, referring to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, a fund that tracks the price of bitcoin. Grayscale is owned by DCG.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin has historically moved in four-year cycles centered around mining reward halving.  Cycles comprised a 12-month-long bear market that ended 15-17 months ahead of the halving, paving the way for a three-year uptrend.  Bitcoin's fourth halving is due early next year.

In a tweet posted today by blockchain intelligence firm Santiment citing the MVRV Z-score, Binance coin (BNB) is the only overvalued crypto amongst tokens with a large market cap. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), Polygon (MATIC), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Uniswap (UNI), and Chainlink (LINK) are very much still undervalued. Price Outlook On BTC, ETH, And Undervalued Large Caps Santiment reported that BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA, DOGE, MATIC, SHIB, UNI, and LINK are undervalued. However, despite their deemed result, each of them was still part of the global crypto market rally or the ‘mini bull run’ seen over the past weeks. Related Reading: Cardano Up 30% Since December As 28 New Whales Hold At least 1 Million ADA BTC and ETH have seen more than a 10% increase in value, respectively, over the past seven days. At the time of writing, both cryptos are up 2% in the last hour, with BTC 24-hour trading volume exceeding $39 billion and ETH surpassing $6 billion. Other large caps like XRP and ADA have also seen significant movement in price to the upside over the past weeks. With XRP up 15% in the last 14 days and ADA up 25% over the same period. Notably, this is not ADA’s first time appearing on Santiment’s undervalued crypto list. Last month, the crypto analytics platform shared an analysis indicating that the Cardano native token was undervalued regardless of the aggressive accumulation from Sharks and Whales holding at least 100k to 10 million ADA tokens. BTC, ETH are undervalued | Source: Santiment Memecoins, such as DOGE, and SHIB, weren’t left out of the global rally as both did 13% and 35%, respectively, over the past 14 days. MATIC, UNI, and LINK have also printed bullish trends over the past week, up by 19%, 13%, and 14%, respectively, in the past two weeks. Binance Coin (BNB) Becomes Overvalued? Though merely looking at it, BNB being overvalued over other large caps such as BTC and ETH might be quite unbelievable. However, BNB’s potential has proved to make the coin overvalued worthy. Late last year, following the collapse of FTX, BNB survived through an industry-wide FUD, which plummeted its value by over 10%, sending it from its hovering $300 trading price to below $250. Related Reading: Binance USD (BUSD) Exchange Reserves Dry Up, Reason Behind Bitcoin’s Slowdown? Despite the intimidating FUD, BNB survived through, as the token didn’t plummet much as expected. Furthermore, since the beginning of the year, BNB has chosen the bullish path surging nearly 15% in the past two weeks. BNB also rallied amid its quarterly burn, which happened on Tuesday, and has so far refused to make a movement for a retracement. However, at the time of writing, BNB’s price is currently down 1.2% over the last 24 hours. As a result, its current market price is sitting at the $288 zone with a 24-high of $296.33 and a trading volume of $550.3 million over the same period.

7802570,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516864,1674214209,"Flashbots Wants To Raise $50 Million, But Investors Must Pitch","Flashbots is seeking to raise $50 million with a $1 billion pre-money valuation, according to The Block, citing sources aware of the deal. Pitch To Flashbots For A Chance to Invest As they look to crowdfund, it has been revealed that Flashbots is doing a “reverse pitching” where interested investors have to pitch, not the other way around. In this arrangement, investors confident of Flashbots’ prospects must explain, in detail, why they should have a slot in this investment round. Eventually, the goal is to raise between $30 million and $50 million in “equity investment,” pushing the firm’s valuation to unicorn status. Flashbot plans to split this investment round into two. Although Paradigm didn’t respond publicly to the publication’s request for comment or comment on the inquiry, details reveal that the crypto fund was among the first to show interest. They participated in Flashbots’ seed sale in 2020. However, Flashbots didn’t indicate the amount raised in the seed sale. Flashbots is a research and development organization claiming to negate the effects of maximum extraction value (MEV) in account-based blockchains like Ethereum and the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). Specifically, Flashbots focuses on Ethereum, where the costs of MEV can be high considering the high on-chain activity and the impact of gas fees, which is also relatively high versus other more scalable networks, including BSC. Their involvement, Flashbots’s documents explain, avoids the “existential risks MEV could cause to state-rich blockchains like Ethereum.” Related Reading: MEV Crypto Bot Gains $1M But Loses Same To Hack Same Day Tackling MEV MEV in blockchains is the maximum value that can be extracted from block production after validators, tasked with confirming transactions and securing the network, include or even re-order transactions in a block. Unlike Bitcoin, where transaction order is given, in Ethereum and similar networks, ordering is haphazard. It means profit-seeking validators can prioritize transactions tagged with higher fees. This explains why whenever the MEV in a block is higher than the network block reward, a validator can decide to re-order transactions in a block, creating vectors for possible centralization and exploitation. Related Reading: ViaBTC Capital | Reasons Behind Solana’s Frequent Downtime: Design Flaws in the Gas Economy Flashbots curbs this problem using MEV Boost. It is software allowing builders to auction blocks to validators, averting MEV centralization. Each party earns a fee for their contribution. Flashbots’s recent open source tool, Single Unifying Auctions for Value Expression (SUAVE), further decentralizes and avails, to everyone, including competitors, the MEV Boost. The reason for open-sourcing SUAVE is novel and meant to help the entire ecosystem grow stronger by proper decentralization. In Devcon Bogota, Philip Daian of Flashbots said: “So, we’re going to use MEV as this decentralized engine in the long term to make sure the users get the best execution on their trades in a way that will make TradFi look embarrassing very shortly.” Feature Image by The Block, Chart from Trading View",NEUTRAL,BTC | BNB,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | ICO | BNB,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/flashbots-wants-to-raise-50-million/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

7799826,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516848,1674208237,Bitcoin Hash Rate at Near All-Time High despite Rising Mining Difficulty,"The Bitcoin hash rate is trending at near all-time highs, per on-chain data on January 20, 2023. Bitcoin Hash Rate at 274 EH/s According to streams from BitInfoCharts, the Bitcoin network currently has a hash rate of 274 EH/s, up by almost one percent in the past 24 hours. Even at this pace, the hash rate is down from January 16 highs of 302 EH/s. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bulls In Check, Signs of Fresh Increase above $21.5K Hash rate is the measure of computing power dedicated to BTC mining. As a proof-of-work platform, the Bitcoin network depends on a community of node operators using Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) gear for block confirmation and security. ASICs are special nodes explicitly designed to mine cryptocurrencies in proof-of-work networks using, among others, the SHA-256 consensus algorithm. ASICs that can mine BTC can also be used to mine its forks, adhering to a proof-of-work system, including Bitcoin Cash. For confirming a block, a miner is rewarded with BTC. The amount of computing power channeled to the Bitcoin network often fluctuates depending on many factors, including the cost of scarce gear, often from Bitmain, and the price of BTC. In recent years, chipset manufacturers, led by Bitmain, have been tuning their equipment, making them more efficient in power consumption. At the same time, they are packing them with more power. Accordingly, the latest BTC ASICs can dispense more computing power. As an illustration, the Bitmain Antminer S19 XP released in July 2022 can produce 140 TH/s while using 3010W. Meanwhile, the older versions, like Bitmain Antminer S17+, can generate 76.00 TH/s while using more power at 3040W. Improving efficiency coupled with rising prices may explain the rising hash rate. Since miners are likely to power their gear as Bitcoin prices recover, the hash rate might bounce, even to new all-time highs, in the months ahead. This will be especially true if BTC prices continue to maintain the current trajectory. After months of lower lows in 2022, Bitcoin appeared to have bottomed up in November 2022 at $15,300. Prices are now trending above $20,000, according to TradingView charts. Mining Difficulty Adjusted Upwards Hash rate trends and difficulty readings are proportional. In response to the rising hash rate, near all-time highs, the network automatically increased mining difficulty by double digits to 10.26% on January 16. The difficulty was adjusted upwards by 13.55% on October 10, 2022. Mining difficulty in Bitcoin changes depending on the hash rate. With more computing power, miners can extract more coins within the allocated 10-minute block-producing time. Bitcoin ensures that this never happens by increasing difficulty, making confirming a block more tasking and consuming more resources. In this way, the 10-minute block-producing time is retained, and the network continues to function as designed, regardless of the investment made by miners. Related Reading: Bitcoin Might Fall Below $20,000 Before Bull Rally Resumes, Analyst Says In their observation, Binance, which also operates a mining pool, said if BTC prices rise above $23,000, miners using efficient miners would still turn in a profit despite the upward difficulty adjustment.

42414597,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBC7ZC,1674199335,"Bitcoin, Ether Hold Steady After Genesis' Bankruptcy; Crypto Traders Say Bad News Was Priced In","""It is incredible to see how bitcoin has reacted to the Genesis Bankruptcy news,"" one crypto observer tweeted Monday, marveling at the top cryptocurrency's muted reaction to one of the largest institutional firm's crypto lending business filing for bankruptcy protection.  Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded in stasis at around $21,000, exhibiting a 0.7% gain on a 24-hour basis after the Genesis news hit the wires. The second-largest cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), changed hands near $1,545, up 1.2%, CoinDesk data shows.  However, not everyone was surprised by bitcoin and ether's resilience.  ""The market appeared to expect the Genesis bankruptcy filing for the last 48 hours as the GBTC discount suddenly widened again. With Genesis filing for bankruptcy, this removes a negative overhang from the market, and crypto investors can finally focus on fundamentals,"" Markus Thielen, head of strategy and research at crypto services provider Matrixport, said.  The discount in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Shares (GBTC) relative to the underlying bitcoin held in the fund widened from 36% to 42% this week, according to data sourced from YCharts. Grayscale, Genesis and CoinDesk are independent subsidiaries of the Digital Currency Group (DCG).  The threat of Genesis' bankruptcy had been looming large since the lender froze withdrawals after the stunning collapse of Sam Bankman Fried's FTX exchange in November.  And the FTX contagion fears kept the crypto market under pressure in the final two months of 2022, even as macroeconomic headwinds became tailwinds and traditional risk assets rallied.  ""Everyone knew it was coming,"" Mike Alfred, a value investor and founder of digital assets investment platform Eaglebrook Advisors, said, referring to the steady price action in the market.  Alfred, however, warned of a continued flow of bad news ahead. ""There are two to four other firms that are currency-insolvent, and it will take a shock probably from the real economy to reveal this. Rates rising combined with a major volatility spike and/or sovereign debt issue could tip a few more firms,"" Alfred noted.  That said, the market could continue to show resilience to bad news, considering the lack of sellers in the market, as analysts told CoinDesk earlier this month.  Besides, the crypto market has seen a bull revival this month, with bitcoin and ether gaining 27% and 29%, respectively and sophisticated traders scrambling to add upside exposure.  ""Transaction volumes have started to rise again on the Ethereum blockchain and this has resulted in crypto outperforming traditional assets, such as U.S. stocks, by +25% since the beginning of the year,"" Thielen noted.  Thielen said that the path of least resistance for the market is on the higher side while heading into the seasonally bullish period of the Chinese New Year. This year, the period begins on Jan. 22 and ends on Feb. 9.  ""Buying bitcoin at the end of the first day of Chinese New Year and selling it 10 trading days later would have returned +9%, on average, with all of the last eight years (2015-2022) showing positive returns. This is a hit ratio of 100%,"" he said.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/20/bad-news-is-priced-in-crypto-traders-say-as-btc-eth-hold-steady-after-genesis-bankruptcy-filing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae190442110770b3403f715fe6ebfd7245ccff96-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The tweet comes after Winklevoss waged a Twitter war against DCG to recover the loan amid his crypto exchange’s own struggles.  Winklevoss called the lender’s bankruptcy a “crucial step” toward recovering Gemini users’ assets. But he still intends to sue DCG, Silbert and Genesis unless Silbert makes a ""fair offer"" to Gemini's creditors.  “We have been preparing to take direct legal action against Barry, DCG and others who share responsibility for the fraud that has caused harm to the 340,000+ Earn users and others duped by Genesis and its accomplices,” wrote Winklevoss.  The latest tweets follow a weeks-long public spat between Winklevoss and Silbert over the repayment of a $900 million loan Gemini made to Genesis. Winklevoss has also called for Silbert’s ouster from DCG, alleging that Silbert had mixed funds among the numerous companies he manages.  However, in its voluntary petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the Southern District of New York court, Genesis Global Capital disputed some of Gemini's claims. Genesis pointed out the $900 million loan is the net proceed from the foreclosure of certain assets, and disputes whether the foreclosure satisfied applicable law.  In his latest tweets, Winklevoss also reiterated his previous allegations that Silbert failed to cooperate with Gemini to draft a plan for the loan’s repayment.  DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk.  “While we have been working around the clock to negotiate an acceptable solution, @BarrySilbert and @DCGco – the parent company of Genesis – continue to refuse to offer creditors a fair deal,” wrote Winklevoss.  Gemini and Genesis forged a working relationship in 2021 for Gemini Earn, a high-yield-bearing offering serving hundreds of thousands of U.S. investors. For the Earn product, Gemini lent customers’ funds to Genesis, which, in turn, loaned that money out to other crypto firms.  But things went south in November when Genesis suspended redemptions and new loan originations after making a series of bad loans to crypto firms Three Arrows Capital and FTX, both of which later wound up in bankruptcy court. Without access to their funds, some Gemini Earn users turned on Winklevoss, suing him and the exchange's co-founder, his brother Tyler, for alleged fraud.  Genesis’ bankruptcy announcement comes at a time when Genesis and Gemini are embroiled in a dispute with regulators. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in a lawsuit filed late last week, allege the two firms sold unregistered securities through the Earn program.

42414610,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBC8gB,1674189240,Genesis' Crypto Lending Businesses File for Bankruptcy Protection,"Genesis Global Holdco LLC, the holding company of troubled cryptocurrency lender Genesis Global Capital, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York after being pummeled by two of 2022's biggest industry collapses.  Genesis Global Holdco, LLC and its subsidiaries Genesis Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd and Genesis Global Capital, LLC filed a trio of voluntary petitions with the United States U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. All three fall under the umbrella of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk. Genesis has moved for joint administration of the cases.  In its filing, Genesis Global Capital, the partner firm to Gemini's defunct Earn program, estimated more than 100,000 creditors and between $1 billion and $10 billion in liabilities, as well as assets. The two other entities estimated their assets and liabilities in the $100 million and $500 million range, respectively.  Genesis owes over $3.5 billion to its top 50 creditors, among which include crypto exchange Gemini, trading giant Cumberland, Mirana, MoonAlpha Finance and VanEck’s New Finance Income Fund, according to the bankruptcy filing published late Thursday.  Those companies comprise Genesis' crypto lending business, which was rocked last year by the implosions of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and crypto exchange FTX. Genesis' other subsidiaries involved in the derivatives and spot trading and custody businesses as well as Genesis Global Trading were not included in the filing and continue client trading operations, according to a press release.  In its filing, Genesis Global Capital said it expects that through the restructuring process, there will be money left over to pay unsecured creditors – a group that can get wiped out in bankruptcy cases if the situation is extremely dire.  In a statement on Friday, DCG said that neither it nor any of its employees, including those on Genesis’ board of directors, were involved in the decision for file for bankruptcy, and that DCG would continue to operate “business as usual.""  DCG also reiterated that it owes Genesis Capital roughly $526 million due in May 2023 and $1.1 billion via a promissory note due in June 2032, and that it “fully intends to address its obligations to Genesis Capital in the course of a restructuring.”  Shortly after FTX collapsed into its own bankruptcy case in November, Genesis Global Capital was forced to suspend customer withdrawals, which hurt customers of a yield product offered by the Gemini crypto exchange.  Genesis had been scrambling to raise fresh capital or reach a deal with creditors. It – along parent company DCG, which also owns CoinDesk – was under increasing pressure to make good on $900 million of locked deposits.  The bankruptcy ""is a crucial step towards us being able to recover your assets,"" the Gemini exchange's CEO, Cameron Winklevoss, tweeted shortly after the filing was announced. In the same tweet string, Winklevoss threatened to sue DCG CEO Barry Silbert over the repayment of the loan. The tweet comes after Winklevoss waged a Twitter war against DCG to recover the loan amid his exchange’s own struggles.     Genesis late last year retained investment bank Moelis & Co. to assist with exploring options.  Before FTX dealt a blow to Genesis, the failure of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital had caused hundreds of millions of dollars in losses for the firm, CoinDesk reported last year.  Earlier this month, Genesis announced it was laying off 30% of its staff, taking it down to 145 employees.  Thursday's bankruptcy filing could have broader implications for bitcoin as Genesis and digital assets manager Grayscale share the same parent company in DCG. Grayscale operates the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has $10 billion-plus in assets under management and was late last year trading at a record discount to net asset value, although that discount has narrowed recently. There are market fears that the repercussions of the Genesis bankruptcy could somehow lead to the liquidation of GBTC's holdings of 600,000+ bitcoin.  UPDATE: (Jan. 20, 2023 8:05 UTC): Updates with amount owed to top 50 creditors, and Gemini's Winklevoss threat to sue DCG.  UPDATE: (Jan 20 16:00 UTC): Adds the filing is in the bankruptcy court in the Southern District of New York.  UPDATE: (Jan 20 17:44 UTC): Adds statement from DCG.

42414605,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBC8Fe,1674186367,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Returns to Its Winning Ways,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: After dipping early Thursday, bitcoin returned to the green; other major cryptos also rose.  Insights: Cobo, the asset management platform, is adopting a key tenet of traditional finance – a distinct custodian and settlement network for trading.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,005.53 +18.1 ▲ 1.8% Bitcoin (BTC) $21,084 +331.1 ▲ 1.6% Ethereum (ETH) $1,553 +29.3 ▲ 1.9% S&P 500 daily close  3,898.85 −30.0 ▼ 0.8% Gold  $1,931 +8.4 ▲ 0.4% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.4% ▲ 0.0 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Returns to Its Winning Ways  By James Rubin  After dipping early Thursday, bitcoin surged back to its most recent foothold comfortably above $21,000.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $21,190, up 1.6% over the past 24 hours, as investors shrugged off the latest fallout from disgraced crypto exchange FTX and conflicting economic data. BTC continued on the more upbeat path throughout 2023.  ""Bitcoin is finding support ahead of the $20,000 level,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email. ""The crypto space is getting cleaned up and as long as we don’t see a major reputable exchange go under, traders may mostly shrug off news of the demise of smaller crypto companies.""  Ether followed a similar trajectory, falling early before landing in the green. The second-largest crypto in market value was recently changing hands above $1,550, a 1.9% gain from Wednesday, same time. Other major cryptos also pointed largely upward, with CRO, the token of exchange Crypto.com, jumping more than 4%, and ATOM, the native crypto of decentralized network Cosmos rising over 3%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently increased by 2%.  Cryptos veered from equity markets, which continued their losing streak this week, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropping 1% and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) each falling the better part of a percentage point. Investors tried to reconcile the release of jobs data indicating that the hot job market had not cooled – a 15,000 weekly decrease in Americans filing for unemployment – with declines in housing starts and building permits. The former suggested the economy is not cooling enough to satisfy central bankers and bodes poorly for crypto, while the latter indicated the reverse.  ""Crypto markets still appear to be operating within a “good economic news equals bad news for asset prices” landscape,"" CoinDesk analyst Glenn Williams wrote.  Meanwhile, the new head of FTX raised the previously unlikely prospect of FTX exchange reviving, according to an interview he gave to The Wall Street Journal, his first since taking over at FTX in November.  CEO John J. Ray III said that despite the accusations of criminal misconduct against former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and other executives, customers have lauded FTX's technology and said it could be worth reviving the exchange. “Everything is on the table,” Ray told the Journal. “If there is a path forward on that, then we will not only explore that, we’ll do it.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector XRP XRP +3.6% Currency Terra LUNA +3.6% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM +3.6% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Decentraland MANA −0.9% Entertainment Solana SOL −0.1% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  Asset Management Firm Cobo Looks to CeFi for Inspiration  By Shaurya Malwa  Cobo, a Singapore-based crypto asset management and custodian platform, is trying to change a key feature of the crypto industry by adopting core tenets of traditional markets – the use of separate custodian, clearing and settlement services for trading.  The separation is a longstanding model in the traditional financial industry. These functions, typically handled by different independent entities, help increase transparency and reduce the risk of fraud and misconduct. This in turn helps to build trust among market participants and contributes to the overall integrity and stability of the financial system.  In the crypto world, however, these functions are combined under one roof by centralized exchanges (CEX). Unlike traditional stock exchanges, crypto CEXs do more than just match buyers and sellers.  They custody and control client funds, act as a counterparty to trades and also provide lending/borrowing services, all with little regulatory oversight. Instead of being a neutral party to transactions, this multifaceted role of CEXs raises major conflict-of-interest issues.  FTX’s dramatic demise offered powerful evidence that CEXs should not dominate all these functions and hold that much power over other market participants.  Investors turn to custodians  With all the uncertainties in CEXs, investors turn to custodians. In November 2019, Cobo was the first custodian to introduce the Loop network – an off-chain settlement network that allows all parties in the Loop to transfer and settle instantly, without fees.  Cobo has now upgraded the Loop network, and this week, launched Superloop, an off-exchange custodian and settlement network that allows traders to trade directly on supported exchanges, with credit secured by collateral held under Cobo’s custody, locked only before the trade.  “In this time of uncertainty, it is extremely important for custodians and exchanges to provide a sense of security and trust towards traders,” Jiang Changhao, chief technology officer and co-founder of Cobo, told CoinDesk.  “SuperLoop provides this trust by ensuring that traders have full control over their assets while trading among exchanges,” he added.  Investors and organizations can make use of Multi-Party Computation (MPC) custody systems to co-manage their funds with an independent custody platform, and at the same time, trade these funds on crypto exchanges that are integrated with clearing and settlement networks hosted by that custody platform.  Cobo’s SuperLoop minimizes counterparty risk by removing the need to pre-fund on exchanges before trading and maximizes capital efficiency by enabling funds to be deployed without the delays and risks of on-chain transfers, providing users with full control over their assets.

42414609,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBC8as,1674182089,"Solana Blockchain SOL Token Doubles From FTX-Crash-Induced Lows, but Will It Continue to Rebound?","One of the hardest-hit tokens of 2022 has been an upbeat story this year.  SOL, the native currency of the Solana blockchain, has doubled its price since mid-December to hover around $21, reaching as high as $24 earlier this week, roughly where it stood before investors started fretting over its entanglement to beleaguered crypto exchange FTX and its sister company Alameda Research. Over the past week alone, SOL has risen 22%, and it is up 114% this year.  The surge started after a favorable tweet by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who expressed “hope” that the Solana community “gets its fair chance to thrive” in a tweet, shortly after SOL had plunged to a record low of $8.19. Buterin’s comment headed off damage from reports that the token was the second-largest holding of Alameda Research, the trading arm of FTX whose unruly balance sheet sparked FTX’s descent into bankruptcy protection, although SOL had already declined significantly prior to the FTX revelation.  According to data from DefiLlama, the total value locked (TVL) on the Solana chain dropped 96% in 2022, from $6.68 billion in January to $206 million at the end of December.  SOL’s price recovery has sparked fresh hopefulness among crypto analysts and blockchain developers and executives over the blockchain’s long-term future.  Critics have lambasted Solana for being too centralized and venture capital controlled. But Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko, said that “with Alameda gone, the protocol is in some sense free of that baggage and can become more community-centric.”  “I think Solana definitely has a lot of staying power,” Carey told CoinDesk. “Will it be a top three or five chain by [total value locked] in a year? I’m really not sure but it certainly has potential.”  Detaching from 'Sam’s coin'  Messari senior research analyst Tom Dunleavy wrote in a recent research note that Solana’s on-chain performance has been strong, with daily active wallets interacting on major Solana protocols remaining constant post-FTX and transaction volumes and active accounts rebounding back to pre-FTX levels.  “It is certainly an open question as to how sticky this new level of volume is. However, at the very least, a consistent level of volume with FTX exiting the ecosystem is a positive sign,” he wrote.  Michael Repetny, core contributor at Solana-based liquid staking protocol Marinade Finance, highlighted that as SOL’s price declined after the FTX crisis, the number of validators also decreased from 2,400 to 2,000.  Repetny attributed Solana’s recent trading volume surge to growing interest in Solana-based meme coin BONK.  “Bonk is like an entry point to the Solana ecosystem, just like people come to non-fungible tokens (NFT) for gaming,” he told CoinDesk in an interview, adding: “With trust and faith in the Solana community, this goes beyond Sam’s coin.”  Rebound to $50  Stefan Rust, CEO of blockchain technology firm Laguna Labs, said Solana has “held the ground solidly” by staying within the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization post-FTX, while hitting the metrics developers seek, including a project's ""distribution,"" ""difficulty in using toolsets,"" ""marketing and visibility"" and ""money."" He expects SOL's price to rebound to $30 and even possibly $50 by the end of the year.  Brendon Sedo, a contributor to layer 1 blockchain Core DAO, compared Solana’s current status quo to Ethereum’s 2018 crash and believes that it will similarly rebound, despite increasing competition from the likes of rivals Aptos and Sui. “I think this is likely going to be the outcome for Solana, pulling off what Ethereum eventually pulled off after the dark days of the 2018 bear market,” he said.  “While it may take time to get rid of the FTX and Alameda baggage, in the long run it is possible that the loss of these toxic entities will lead to a more decentralized and equitable network,” said Akash Mahendra, portfolio manager at multichain digital wealth platform Yield App.",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SOL | TRADING | RESEARCH,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/20/solana-blockchain-sol-token-doubles-from-ftx-crash-induced-lows-but-will-it-continue-to-rebound,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c2a2c2f235a0f0ed558bcfcb0350b27a51b70636-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin's total addressable market is massive but its market cap is tiny in comparison. This is a rare buying opportunity according to many metrics. Bitcoin's halving of the block subsidy will only lead to increasing scarcity. We see incredibly strong fundamentals in the Bitcoin network and are laser-focused on its market dynamic in the context of macroeconomic trends. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) aims to become the world reserve currency, an investment opportunity that cannot be understated. In our year-ahead report, we analyzed seven notable factors that we recommend investors pay attention to going into 2023. Convicted Bitcoin Investors We can put investor conviction into perspective by looking at the number of unique Bitcoin addresses holding at least 0.01, 0.1 and 1 Bitcoin. This data shows that Bitcoin adoption continues to grow with a growing number of unique addresses holding at least these amounts of Bitcoin. While it is entirely possible for individual users to hold their Bitcoin in multiple addresses, the growth of unique Bitcoin addresses holding at least 0.01, 0.1 and 1 Bitcoin indicate that more users than ever before are buying Bitcoin and holding it in self-custody. Image created by author with data from Glassnode Another promising metric is the amount held by long-term holders, which has increased to almost 14 million Bitcoin. Long-term holder supply is calculated using a threshold of a 155-day holding period, after which dormant coins become increasingly unlikely to be spent. As of now, 72.49% of the Bitcoin in circulation is not likely to be sold at these prices. Image created by author with data from Glassnode There is a large subset of Bitcoin investors who are accumulating the digital asset no matter the price. In a December 2022 interview on “Going Digital,” our head of market research, Dylan LeClair, said: “You have people all over the world that are acquiring this asset and you have a huge and growing cohort of people that are price-agnostic accumulators.” With a growing number of unique addresses holding Bitcoin and such a significant amount of Bitcoin being held by long-term investors, we are optimistic for Bitcoin’s advancement and rate of adoption. There are many variables that demonstrate the potential for asymmetric returns as demand for Bitcoin increases and adoption increases worldwide. Total Addressable Market During monetization, a currency goes through three phases in order: store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account. Bitcoin is currently in its store-of-value phase as demonstrated by the long-term holder metrics above. Other assets that are frequently used as stores of value are real estate, gold and equities. Bitcoin is a better store of value for many reasons: it is more liquid, easier to access, transport and secure, easier to audit and more finitely scarce than any other asset with its hard-cap limit of 21 million coins. For Bitcoin to acquire a larger share of other global stores of value, these properties need to remain intact and prove themselves in the eyes of investors. Image created by author with data from SIFMA Fact Book As readers can see, Bitcoin is a tiny fraction of global wealth. Should Bitcoin take even a 1% share from these other stores of value, the market cap would be $5.9 trillion, putting Bitcoin at over $300,000 per coin. These are conservative numbers from our viewpoint because we estimate that Bitcoin adoption will happen gradually, and then suddenly. Transfer Volume When looking at the amount of value that was cleared on the Bitcoin network throughout its history, there is a clear upward trend in USD terms with a heightened demand for transferring Bitcoin this year. In 2022, there was a change-adjusted transfer volume of over 556 million Bitcoin settled on the Bitcoin network, up 102% from 2021. In USD terms, the Bitcoin network settled just shy of $15 trillion in value in 2022. Image created by author with data from Glassnode Bitcoin’s censorship resistance is an extremely valuable feature as the world enters into a period of deglobalization. With a market capitalization of only $324 billion, we believe Bitcoin is severely undervalued. Despite the drop in price, the Bitcoin network transferred more value in USD terms than ever before. Rare Opportunity In Bitcoin’s Price By looking at certain metrics, we can analyze the unique opportunity investors have to purchase Bitcoin at these prices. The Bitcoin realized market cap is down 18.8% from all-time highs, which is the second-largest drawdown in its history. While the macroeconomic factors are something to keep in mind, we believe that this is a rare buying opportunity. Image created by author with data from Glassnode Relative to its history, Bitcoin is at the phase of the cycle where it’s about as cheap as it gets. Its current market exchange rate is approximately 20% lower than its average cost basis on-chain, which has only happened at or near the local bottom of Bitcoin market cycles. Current prices of Bitcoin are in rare territory for investors looking to get in at a low exchange rate. Historically, purchasing Bitcoin during these times has brought tremendous returns in the long term. With that said, readers should consider the reality that 2023 likely brings about Bitcoin’s first experience with a prolonged economic recession. Macroeconomic Environment As we move into 2023, it’s necessary to recognize the state of the geopolitical landscape because macro is the driving force behind economic growth. People around the world are experiencing a monetary policy lag effect from last year’s central bank decisions. The U.S. and EU are in recessionary territory, China is proceeding to de-dollarize and the Bank of Japan raised its target rate for yield curve control. All of these have a large influence on capital markets. Nothing in financial markets occurs in a vacuum. Bitcoin’s ascent through 2020 and 2021 — while similar to previous crypto-native market cycles — was very much tied to the explosion of liquidity sloshing around the financial system after COVID. While 2020 and 2021 was characterized by the insertion of additional liquidity, 2022 has been characterized by the removal of liquidity. Interestingly enough, when denominating Bitcoin against U.S. Treasury bonds (which we believe to be Bitcoin’s largest theoretical competitor for monetary value over the long term), comparing the drawdown during 2022 was rather benign compared to drawdowns in Bitcoin’s history. btcization As we wrote in “The Everything Bubble: Markets At A Crossroads,” “Despite the recent bounce in stocks and bonds, we aren’t convinced that we have seen the worst of the deflationary pressures from the global liquidity cycle.” In “The Bank of Japan Blinks And Markets Tremble,” we noted, “As we continue to refer to the sovereign debt bubble, readers should understand what this dramatic upward repricing in global yields means for asset prices. As bond yields remain at elevated levels far above recent years, asset valuations based on discounted cash flows fall.” Bitcoin does not rely on cash flows, but it will certainly be impacted by this repricing of global yields. We believe we are currently at the third bullet point of the following playing out: https://twitter.com/DylanLeClair_/status/1392136994315251715 (Twitter) Bitcoin Mining And Infrastructure While the multitude of negative industry and worrying macroeconomic factors have had a major dampening on Bitcoin’s price, looking at the metrics of the Bitcoin network itself tell another story. The hash rate and mining difficulty gives a glimpse into how many ASICs are dedicating hashing power to the network and how competitive it is to mine Bitcoin. These numbers move in tandem and both have almost exclusively gone up in 2022, despite the significant drop in price. Image created by author with data from Glassnode Image created by author with data from Glassnode By deploying more machines and investing in expanded infrastructure, Bitcoin miners demonstrate that they are more bullish than ever. The last time the Bitcoin price was in a similar range in 2017, the network hash rate was one-fifth of current levels. This means that there has been a fivefold increase in Bitcoin mining machines being plugged in and efficiency upgrades to the machines themselves, not to mention the major investments in facilities and data centers to house the equipment. Because the hash rate increased while the Bitcoin price decreased, miner revenue took a beating this year after a euphoric rise in 2021. Public miner stock valuations followed the same path with valuations falling even more than the Bitcoin price, all while the Bitcoin network’s hash rate continued to rise. In the “State Of The Mining Industry: Survival Of The Fittest,” we looked at the total market capitalization of public miners which fell by over 90% since January 2021. Image created by author with data from Glassnode We expect more of these companies to face challenging conditions because of the skyrocketing global energy prices and interest rates mentioned above. Increasing Scarcity One way to analyze Bitcoin’s scarcity is by looking at the illiquid supply of coins. Liquidity is quantified as the extent to which an entity spends their Bitcoin. Someone that never sells has a liquidity value of 0 whereas someone who buys and sells Bitcoin all the time has a value of 1. With this quantification, circulating supply can be broken down into three categories: highly liquid, liquid and illiquid supply. Illiquid supply is defined as entities that hold over 75% of the Bitcoin they deposit to an address. Highly liquid supply is defined as entities that hold less than 25%. Liquid supply is between the two. This illiquid supply quantification and analysis was developed by Rafael Schultze-Kraft, co-founder and CTO of Glassnode. Image created by author with data from Glassnode 2022 was the year of getting Bitcoin off exchanges. Every recent major panic became a catalyst for more individuals and institutions to move coins into their own custody, find custody solutions outside of exchanges or sell off their Bitcoin entirely. When centralized institutions and counterparty risks are flashing red, people rush for the exit. We can see some of this behavior through Bitcoin outflows from exchanges. In 2022, 572,118 Bitcoin worth $9.6 billion left exchanges, marking it the largest annual outflow of Bitcoin in BTC terms in history. In USD terms, it was second only to 2020, which was driven by the March 2020 COVID crash. 11.68% of Bitcoin supply is now estimated to be on exchanges, down from 16.88% back in 2019. Image created by author with data from Glassnode Image created by author with data from Glassnode These metrics of an increasingly illiquid supply paired with historic amounts of Bitcoin being withdrawn from exchanges — ostensibly being removed from the market — paint a different picture than what we’re seeing with the factors outside of the Bitcoin network’s purview. While there are unanswered questions from a macroeconomic perspective, Bitcoin miners continue to invest in equipment and on-chain data shows that Bitcoin holders aren’t planning to relinquish their Bitcoin anytime soon. Conclusion The varying factors detailed above give a picture for why we are long-term bullish on the Bitcoin price going into 2023. The Bitcoin network continues to add another block approximately every 10 minutes, more miners keep investing in infrastructure by plugging in machines and long-term holders are unwavering in their conviction, as shown by on-chain data. With Bitcoin’s ever-increasing scarcity, the supply side of this equation is fixed, while demand is likely to increase. Bitcoin investors can get ahead of the demand curve by averaging in while the price is low. It’s important for investors to take the time to learn how Bitcoin works to fully understand what it is they are investing in. Bitcoin is the first digitally native and finitely scarce bearer asset. We recommend readers learn about self-custody and withdraw their Bitcoin from exchanges. Despite the negative news cycle and drop in Bitcoin price, our bullish conviction for Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition remains unfazed.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4571069-7-factors-bitcoin-investors-should-watch-in-2023?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7786746.jpeg
