42426738,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwJTh,1458947013,Bitcoin Prices Steady As Subsidy Halving Inches Closer,"Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets, and the technology's use case as an asset class.  Bitcoin prices  fluctuated within a tight range of $405 to $420 during the seven days ending 25th March, maintaining relative stability even as the bitcoin community faces questions of scalability and an upcoming drop in the number of new bitcoins minted per transaction block.  The modest price fluctuations followed the trend of the last several weeks, with prices generally enjoying stability and consistent trading volume. During the week ending 18th March, for example, bitcoin prices wavered between $410 and $420 while market participants traded 30m BTC.  This level of trading volume continued during the seven days through 25th March at 12:30 UTC, totaling 32.6m BTC, Bitcoinity figures reveal. Chinese exchange OKCoin accounted for 50.31% of this volume, while Huobi took up another 46.90%. The remaining exchanges all claimed less than 1% of the remaining volume.  Bitcoin experienced a modest week-over-week decline during the seven-day period through 12:00 UTC on 25th March, starting out at $418.31 and ending at $414.34. However, the digital currency did experience some fluctuations in that time, falling to $404.62 at 12:00 UTC and then recovering to $409.01 at 09:00 UTC on 19th March.  Several hours later, bitcoin prices declined once again, hitting its weekly low of $404.45 at 09:00 UTC on 19th March before recovering to $412.20 at 18:00 UTC on 19th March.  The currency kept zig-zagging, rising to $418.41 by 21:00 UTC on 23th March.  Ether rising  In addition, the digital currency ether has been generating substantial visibility, a development that could draw attention – and trading activity – away from bitcoin.  While bitcoin experienced these modest fluctuations, ether saw increased trading volume. The digital currency enjoyed transaction volume of 31,821 transactions and 36,947 transactions on 18th March and 24th March, respectively, Etherscan.io figures reveal.  This compares to the beginning of the month, when traders generated 21,778 transactions and 23,562 transactions on 1st March and 2nd March, respectively.  In addition, the digital currency’s average daily hash rate has been rising steadily, reaching as much as 1431.6 GH/s on 22nd March, nearly three times as much as the 498.6 GH/s that existed on 1st January and more than 60 times the 23.8 GH/s attained on 30th July, 2015, Etherscan.io data shows.  The development is a sign that miners are beginning to see value in protecting the network and winning its block rewards as the price shows stability.  Bitcoin holding steady  Even though ether seems to be making progress as an alternative digital currency – or at least becoming an attractive option for day traders – bitcoin prices have held up, a positive sign according to market observers.  ""The price of BTC has not collapsed, people aren’t selling BTC to buy Ether,” Bart Stephens, managing partner of Blockchain Capital, told CoinDesk. “I think it’s new capital.""  While Stephens emphasized ether’s impact on bitcoin, other market experts pointed to the looming issues of upcoming network subsidy halving in bitcoin – a looming prospect highlighted by Joseph Lee, founder of bitcoin derivatives trading platform Magnr.  ""The steady bitcoin price shows strong faith in bitcoin’s underlying halving mechanism, this will be the network’s second major halving event,"" Lee told CoinDesk.  Bitcoin's underlying code calls for a drop in the number of newly minted coins per block as time goes on. Currently, when a new block is successfully found on the network, 25 bitcoins are introduced. The next halving, estimated to take place between early and mid July, will reduce this number to 12.5 BTC per block.  For his part, Lee sees the impact of this subsidy drop largely baked into the price of bitcoin today.  “Because the event is predictable and the dates known, it is likely that the price has already factored in the new changes,"" he said.  Mixed opinions  While Lee’s statements reflected confidence in the bitcoin network, not everyone is so optimistic. Some are hoping that bitcoin developers will resolve the question of network scalability in the near term.  Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Currency Fund, a digital currency-focused hedge fund, stressed the urgency of finding a solution.  ""The whole thing depends on the hard fork at this point,"" he told CoinDesk. ""It doesn’t matter which solution is the best. We just need to pick one. We need to select one and move on.""  Enneking went on to comment on price, stating:  ""We've really moving sideways, and the fact we are at $400 means that everyone thinks the problem will be solved. It also means it hasn't been solved yet.”  Christopher Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead at investment management firm ARK Invest, told CoinDesk that ""the whole community is just holding its breath"".  However, the comments come as network technologists continue to suggest a hard fork will not be needed to address bitcoin's short-term scalability challenges, and that contrary to what critics say, increased fees are not a deterrent to new users.

42426726,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwJ9h,1458939046,"Hyperledger On Verge of Merging Blockchain IBM, Digital Asset Code","This morning the technical steering committee for the open-source Hyperledger project was on the verge of unanimously voting to formally merge the codebases donated by three of their founding members, thus laying the foundation of a new enterprise-grade blockchain.  Yet a single committee member, who was not identified by name, became the lone dissenting voice – a move that, for now, curtailed the effort to merge code contributed by startups Blockstream and Digital Asset, as well as tech giant IBM.  But, the meeting, a face-to-face gathering of participants of the first Hyperledger Hackathon dedicated to creating an open-source blockchain platform, was by no means a failure.  ""It was really encouraging to see the core companies working together, and some new joiners,"" said Philip DesAutels, the event’s emcee, and senior director at the Linux Foundation, which hosts the project. ""This is a really encouraging start for an open-source project.""  Established in December 2015 the Hyperledger Project is an effort headed by the non-profit Linux Foundation and comprised of 30 founding members. Its mission is to build an enterprise-grade distributed ledger framework.  Proof-of-concept creation  One of the more notable items brought up during the meeting was the disclosure that a proof-of-concept had been successfully created using the combined code bases from Blockstream, Digital Asset Holdings and IBM.  Robert Fajta, senior developer at Digital Asset, announced the move.  ""By the end of yesterday we achieved a proof-of-concept integration of these three code bases,"" he said.  The proof-of-concept combined Blockstream’s validation code, IBM's OBC/UTXO Chaincode and Digital Asset Holding’s client layers. For the actual test, an account was loaded with 100,000 satoshis and a fee charged of 5,000 satoshis to transfer 30,000 satoshis to another account. Fajta asked for a round of applause from the audience, which was given.  ""Our task is not done yet,"" said Fajta. ""There are further things we need to do. It was just a proof-of-concept.""  Dissenting vote  The enthusiasm of the moment transitioned into the part of the meeting dealing specifically with the technical steering committee, including some big names from across industries. DesAutels seemed keen to pass a measure that would formally allow for the integration of the three codebases so future testers and participants of potential future hackathons could use the unified code.  ""The recommendation from the team is that we do merge the codebases,"" said DesAutels. ""I put it to the technical steering, is that the path we proceed to?""  The vote was informal. After establishing a quorum, one after another, sounds of agreement came from the audience.  ""I agree whole-heartedly,"" said one audience member. ""You’re good?"" DesAutels asked another. ""Is there anyone not in agreement?""  ""I’m a little concerned about making an agreement until I see something in writing,"" an unidentified voice announced, followed by a brief silence. ""I’d feel better if we had a little more progress on the requirement side.""  And just like that, the hopes of a seamless transition to the next phase of development were dashed.  Technically, DesAutels could have called for a vote, and with at most a two-thirds majority required according to the charter, he would have likely won. But the host, apparently not wanting to alienate the voter, conceded – albeit a bit stubbornly.  ""This is open-source, we can take this wherever we want, but we do need to move forward,"" he said. ""There’s consensus even if there’s not unanimity. I will write it up though.""  Planning for the next meeting is scheduled to start next week after the holiday weekend is over. Another informal vote was held to help determine the location of the meeting, with an overwhelming vote to hold it in the East Coast of the US. The West Coast, Paris, Amsterdam, and Budapest were also suggested.  Work on white paper  At today’s meeting members also reviewed the efforts of their first-ever Hyperledger Hackathon and pushed ahead on the group's first whitepaper. JPMorgan Chase executive director, David Voell reviewed the progress of the whitepaper.  The draft itself is being written using Google Docs, where changes can be proposed by members but only implemented with consensus. Interestingly, to get things started, Voell said the group quite literally copied an earlier whitepaper written by IBM and replaced ""IBM"" with ""Hyperledger.""  “It was a good place to start off,” he explained.  But now the content is being tailored to the members' specifications, with the goal of presenting a clear explanation of what will distinguish the Hyperledger Project from efforts specifically mentioned, including bitcoin and Ripple.  ""What we want to point out here is there are a lot of use-cases [for bitcoin and Ripple that] are not appropriate,"" said Voell.  The current version of the whitepaper can be read here and comments will be reviewed on 6th April.

42426739,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwJXh,1458928927,Behind the Scenes at the Launch of a New Blockchain Consortium,"Last night a group representing 40 banks, accounting firms and members of the media gathered for the public launch of Domus Tower, a whispered-about startup rumored to be developing a blockchain capable of facilitating more than 1 million transactions per second.  At the event on the seventh floor of Museum Tower in Midtown Manhattan, the company’s chief technical officer demonstrated an early version of the blockchain, though one admittedly not running at anywhere near its theoretic top speed.  But beyond the geeky tech demos, the startup with an unusual history and new approach announced it was in the early phases of launching a new trust-based blockchain consortium. The group would be dedicated to settling equities in the US and eventually comprised of five companies each representing a different sector.  The company's CEO Joe Forster said:  ""By having an immutable recording device and public-private keys, you can develop the trust to straight-through process.""  Focus on settlement  The blockchain itself, designed to render irrelevant a very specific division of the DTCC that provides clearing and settlement services, isn't composed of any revolutionary cryptographic tools, but rather public-private key functionality combined with hashing, much like the bitcoin blockchain.  By trimming fat elsewhere in the code, the company’s CTO, Rhett Creighton, said he’s able to transact blocks of 10,000 transactions each at a rate as high as more than 1 million transactions per second.  To be precise, the Domus blockchain — as the company calls it — has reached a top speed of 1.24 million transactions per second, according to numbers released in a white paper describing the technology's makeup and performance. The maximum transaction size in the test was 256 bytes, counting the size of signature itself.  The most heated part of the evening was when Creighton, a graduate of MIT, turned over questions from the audience to those with a particular bent for the more techy-side of cryptography.  Concerns arose about an apparent inability for the technology as it currently exists to deal in smart, or self-executing contracts, and concern over Domus' claim that it would replace bitcoin’s proof-of-work and Ripple’s federated voting with a trusted system where ""participants know each other and independently decide who to trust,"" as the white paper puts it.  Two members of the audience representing one of the largest banks in the world countered: ""We know our partners, but we don’t necessarily trust them.""  Exit from stealth  Founded in 2014 by Ryan Singer, co-founder of the now-shuttered Tradehill bitcoin exchange, the company has had a long, drawn-out period of stealth. After going through several website incarnations, the site is currently completely offline, and Singer left in 2015.  Creighton, a graduate of MIT, then took over as lead blockchain developer, and Forster took over as CEO.  As part of last night’s coming out party, attended by representatives of JPMorgan Chase, BNY Mellon, Ernst & Young and more, Forster announced that the company was seeking a $25m investment, and would be forming a consortium of five companies from different sectors.  Instead of building the consortium out of different banks — as was the case with R3CEV — or a large group of differing companies — as was the case with Hyperledger — Domus Tower is seeking five consortium members: an accounting firm, a custodian, an investment manager, a broker dealer, and a stock exchange.  The $25m investment Domus hopes to raise would then be allocated to each member. In exchange for joining, the companies will receive a non-compete agreement for the two years Domus expects it will take to complete an industry-grade blockchain. During that period each company will be the only member of its sector to be given access to the developing software, with influence over the project's trajectory.  ""We are a startup,"" said CFO Roy Epstein, during remarks to the audience. ""But we’ll have an institutional veneer too.""  As part of that veneer, instead of trying to put the established players out of business, Domus Tower hopes to work with them. Specifically, they plan to send daily batch reports to the DTCC. But there would be one exception – another branch of the DTCC, the National Securities Clearing Corporation, or the NSCC.  Forster concluded:  ""The one casualty could be NSCC in this whole process. We're trying to work with all the existing participants except them.""

42426741,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwJZh,1458919640,World Economic Forum Gears Up for Hands-On Blockchain Research in 2016,"You can add R Jesse McWaters, financial innovation lead at the World Economic Forum (WEF), to the growing chorus of industry voices warning that we’ve reached a ""peak"" when it comes to the hype surrounding blockchain technology.  ""I’m trepidatious about inflated expectations re: the blockchain,"" McWaters said in a new interview, the comments coming as he described the ongoing ""awakening"" he’s seen among major financial institutions in regards to the technology.  While even the WEF itself has lauded blockchain as a global ""mega-trend"", McWaters worries that such language may encourage institutions to overlook the serious challenges facing the further development of the technology.  McWaters told CoinDesk:  ""There can be a tendency to assume that the technology not only enables a distributed financial architecture, but makes the transition to it easy. I think that nothing could be further from the case.""  McWaters said that through his work with the Swiss non-profit, he’s drawing the conclusion that process will need to be realigned, stakeholders will need to standardize data policies and regulators will need to understand blockchain systems should the ecosystem want to achieve stable growth.  ""It’s wonderful to see the awakening, but we need to see that this excitement is tempered by patience and that taking the tech from pilots to full-scale implementation will be measured not in months and not in years, but maybe decades,"" he continued.  McWaters also took aim at comparisons between the blockchain and Internet industries, cautioning that what is often lost in this comparison is the amount of time this transition took.  ""Many of those discussion points,"" he added, ""weren’t fully realized until the 2010s.""  Explorations ahead  Still, the WEF is on the verge of conducting trials of its own.  Launched in 2014, the WEF has been increasing its focus in understanding disruptive innovations as part of a larger look at the future of financial services.  Phase one of the project, which culminated in its June 2015 'mega-trends' report, has now given way to a second chapter in the project, one in which the organization will seek to understand the impact of the technologies it has identified.  As detailed in a February releasehttps://www.weforum.org/global-challenges/future-of-the-global-financial-system/projects/disruptive-innovation-in-financial-services, the WEF now intends to conduct a project that will deepen its understanding of use cases for blockchain tech ""with and between financial institutions"".  The blockchain trial is one of two described, alongside a similar exploration of how technology could transform the area of digital identity.  As part of this research, the WEF said it will perform secondary consultation, develop and stress test use cases and build business cases to support implementations of the tech, though McWaters said it is best to think of the organization as a “convener” of conversations.  ""We play the role in being a neutral party that convenes discussions,"" he said, later adding:  ""We have really wanted to maintain an awareness of these protocols, but we don’t feel we have the expertise to pick a winner or make recommendations.""  The WEF will hold two distributed ledger workshops, the first in Australia in April and the second to be held in New York in May.  Following the event, the WEF aims to publish a report summarizing its findings.  Tech agnostic  Still, McWaters said the role of the WEF is to think about how the tech will impact business, not necessarily to weigh in on what he called the ""technology arms races"" in the industry.  This means that when it comes to the industry, the WEF does not have an official position on protocols available from developers working on bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Hyperledger or other alternatives.  ""Where we conduct secondary research and convene groups of people from the FinTech space, we’re bringing them together to have conversations on use cases,"" McWaters said. ""We’re equally interested in observing where there is broad agreement on the necessary conditions to unlocking that value, as well as if there’s disagreement.""  Further, McWaters said that he has engaged a wide variety of stakeholders, including BitPay, Chain and Digital Asset Holdings as part of its research and investigations into the technology.  The WEF had previously named Ripple as one of its ""Technology Pioneers"", alongside 49 companies including Google, Mozilla and Twitter. As a result, Ripple was invited to the WEF’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, this January.  Evolving views  To underscore the WEF’s cautionary approach, McWaters explained that his organization has seen its views on blockchain technology shift over time.  For example, he said that initial mentions of blockchain in its reports may have been overly focused on its impact in the payment industry.  ""Obviously there are applications in that space, but at the time, we were wrapping up phase one, we were beginning to recognize that, in fact, implications of blockchains were much more broadly transformative,"" he recalled.  He said the WEF’s thinking has now expanded beyond this formerly limited line of thinking, but that he remains open-minded in his thinking on the technology.  Still, he said that the ecosystem benefits from an organization like the WEF given its reach and ability to serve as a neutral venue for governments, small companies, big banks and other stakeholders. The WEF is funded by membership fees, partner fees and from the proceeds of annual events. Strategic partners, for example, include companies like Barclays, Cisco, Facebook and General Motors.  ""If you look at the world of finance, this is a topic that is emerging, and there’s a role for WEF because it goes beyond just the financial players,"" WEF senior media manager Peter Vanham told CoinDesk.  McWaters said that the WEF’s work with blockchain tech so far could be best described as an ""interesting journey"", one that he is excited to continue given its potential implications and the need institutions have for quality information on the technology.  He concluded:  ""We’re aware there are unanswered questions.""  R Jesse McWaters is speaking at Consensus 2016 in New York. Join him at the Marriott Marquis from 2nd to 4th May.
