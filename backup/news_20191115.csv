42382992,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9thAJ,1573857310,"Alibaba Denies 'Partnership' With Lolli, Highlighting Crypto Industry Pitfalls","On Monday, CoinDesk reported the shopping app Lolli was offering bitcoin rewards to U.S.-based Alibaba shoppers for Singles Day.  Alibaba Group representatives have since denied the “partnership” touted by Lolli CEO Alex Adelman. The fissure revealed a common misconception in the blockchain industry.  “One of Alibaba.com’s contractors hired a subcontractor who brokered an affiliate marketing program with Lolli. This was done without the knowledge of Alibaba.com,” an Alibaba spokesperson told CoinDesk. “Alibaba.com's contractor is terminating the relationship with the subcontractor who was working with Lolli. As a result, Lolli should no longer promote or bring traffic to Alibaba.com.”  He added that Lolli “never had the right to claim a partnership with Alibaba.com or imply one with Alibaba Group.”  In response, Adelman said, “There has to be an integration for us to send sales to someone’s site.”  However inflated the promotion of this Singles Day campaign may have been, Adelman’s team wasn’t completely off-base. Contractual agreements seen by CoinDesk appeared to permit the usage of “Alibaba related keywords” in online materials. The startup had already been processing bitcoin rewards for AliExpress shoppers since May 2019.  According to Lolli’s head of communications, Aubrey Strobel, Alibaba.com itself trialed Lolli’s services for 24 hours during the Singles Day campaign, then deactivated “the partnership” after publicity drew attention to the trial.  Subsequent coverage of the announcement misrepresented the deal as Alibaba accepting bitcoin directly. As CoinDesk reported on Friday, Chinese regulators appear to be gearing up for a renewed crackdown on cryptocurrency exchange-related services.  “It seems as though there was a miscommunication on Alibaba’s end and while that’s unfortunate, we look forward to the possibility of working with Alibaba.com again in the future,” Strobel said in a statement. “In the interim, Alibaba Group’s AliExpress is still live on Lolli.""  Faux pas  As it stands, the root cause of the mixed messaging is unclear.  Blockchain companies often claim to have “partnerships” with brands when they really have an indirect affiliate contract or are merely working on a proof-of-concept. On the other hand, some paperwork with representatives from both parties had already been finalized and payments to shoppers were processed before the now-controversial announcement.  This also underscores the challenge of defining what a “partnership” really means at the intersection of e-commerce and crypto.  What the Lolli team saw as expanding on an existing client relationship during a mainstream holiday campaign by the flagship brand, Alibaba Group viewed as a private and “transactional” deal mediated by third parties, according to the Alibaba spokesperson. From Alibaba’s perspective, this was not an official partnership.  The spokesperson claimed there was no direct contact between Lolli and the Alibaba Group, despite the AliExpress rewards processed. The spokesperson added that Alibaba Group does not work with any bitcoin-related companies.

ConsenSys said Cassatt will stay on with the ethereum venture studio in an advisory capacity.  Speaking Friday at San Francisco’s TransTech Conference, Cassatt said his fund is seeking to raise $50 million for its first round. Aligned will focus on emerging technologies including artificial intelligence, healthcare, cryptocurrency and blockchain, according to a statement from Cassatt.  In a blog post published Friday, Cassatt said the fund is “designed to anticipate civilization-scale, evolutionary changes in human behavior.”  Also backing Aligned is DARMA Capital managing partner Andrew Keys, another former ConsenSys executive. The amount of Lubin and Keys' capital participation was not disclosed.  Although wholly separate from ConsenSys, Cassatt is looking to apply similar principles employed by his former firm, Cassatt said in a phone interview. While Aligned is still in its infancy, Cassatt said it’s looking to tackle societal issues such as safe artificial intelligence and mental health in the digital age.  “Not only [are we] looking for that societal change, but [we are] noticing that institutions … are no longer serving their purpose,"" Cassatt said. ""I think we are at a crisis point.""  Joining as an advisor to Aligned Capital is Nichol Bradford, the executive behind the Transformative Tech Lab organizing the Friday event in San Francisco.

42382996,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9thJ7,1573854989,German Regulator Orders ‘KaratGold Coin’ Issuer to Cease Operations,"The hammer is coming down again on the Karatbars ecosystem as German and South African regulators have taken separate actions over sales of a purportedly gold-backed cryptocurrency.  Germany’s Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) disclosed Monday that it hadissued a cease-and-desist order against Karatbit Foundation on Oct. 21 for issuing its KaratGold Coin without necessary licensing in the country.  Also Monday, South Africa’s Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) warned consumers to avoid investments offered by Karatbars International GmbH, a German firm that promotes the allegedly gold-backed KaratGold Coin.  Under the BaFin order, the foundation must “wind up [its] electronic money business” in Germany, the regulator said.  BaFin did not respond to requests for comment by press time.  Run on the ethereum blockchain, the KaratGold Coin (KBC) is listed on about 30 exchanges such as Yobit, with a second token, KaratBank Coin (KCB), yet to launch.  The Belize-based Karatbit Foundation is the issuer of the KaratBank Coin and manager of the Karatbank ecosystem, according to the KaratBank Coin white paper, which describes the entity as “unregulated.”  Karatbars International did not respond to questions by press time.  Karatbars shoots back  Meanwhile, Karatbars International has denied accusations leveled in German business publication Handlesblatt, according to a company Facebook posting Tuesday and a story published Wednesday by The Guardian.  Handlesblatt  reported Monday that the Karatbit Foundation is under orders to return investor funds amounting to $100 million, equivalent to the amount raised in a 2018 initial coin offering (ICO).  Harald Seiz, CEO of Karatbars, further said in the Facebook post that the German finance regulator is mistaken in its order against the firm, basing its actions on a scam website not associated with his firm. He further claimed that the Karatbit Foundation lies outside the regulator’s jurisdiction as German investors were barred from partaking in the ICO.  “We are completely transparent, we have nothing to hide, if there are unanswered questions, we will clarify them, of course, we fully cooperate with the relevant authorities and are very anxious to clear up any misunderstandings as fast as possible interested,” Seiz said in the post.  Seiz also said KaratGold Coin (KBC) is a utility token and therefore “not subject to prospectus” requirements under BaFin regulations and certain interpretations of European Banking Authority guidance.  “Karatbars and its products have never damaged a customer or partner,"" he said.  Regulatory run-ins  The FSCA said Karatbar International has solicited South African investors via messaging platform WhatsApp to purchase unspecified investments without holding the necessary authority to operate in the country.  The warnings from South Africa and Germany come a month after CoinDeskreported on a Florida financial regulator’s inquiries into Karatbars International.  As stated in that earlier report, although Karatbars has promoted a supposedly licensed “cryptocurrency bank” in Miami, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation has stated that Karatbars is not licensed as a bank with the regulator.  Karatbars was also the subject of a recent consumer warning from Nambia and a prior warning in 2014 from the Netherlands.  UPDATE (Nov. 15, 22:10 UTC): An earlier version of this story contained outdated information. HitBTC used to list KaratGold Coin, but it recently delisted the cryptocurrency.

42383002,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9thLd,1573854059,Bitcoin Falls Through Key Average as Traditional Markets Hit Record Highs,"View  Strong performances in traditional assets and a lack of new reasons to buy crypto is suppressing BTC’s price.  A loss of the 50-day moving average exposes the $8,000 price level.  The daily RSI shows that momentum slowing, which could hint at greater selling pressure in the short term.  Bitcoin (BTC) is at risk of another sell-off after its price fell beneath a key moving average on Nov. 15, as a relatively strong performance by traditional assets caught investor attention.  According to Jeff Dorman, CIO at Arca, an investment management firm dealing in digital assets, BTC’s drop in price is inversely correlated to the strength of global markets, including record highs of the DJIA, this week.  “Volumes are low, no new money is coming into the ecosystem, and stocks, bonds and gold are all up double-digits year-to-date which makes the non-crypto world lose focus,” Dorman said.  Daily chart  At 14:00 UTC, BTC fell 2.1 percent breaking through the 50-day moving average (MA), flagging potential for a deeper drawdown from Oct. 25’s peak of $10,350.  The loss of the 50-day MA means the price of BTC could fall through the $8,000 level, and, if combined with a looming long-term bear cross of the 100 and 200-day MA’s, could confirm a long-term bearish indicator.  In addition, the RSI, a measurement of trader momentum and sentiment, did not exceed the neutral line at 50.00 after falling beneath that point on Nov. 10, hinting at greater selling pressure for next week.  Total daily volume has remained flat since Nov. 12, meaning that there has been no new reason to buy or sell.  Dorman said trader sentiment today has less to do with negative events and more to do with a lack of positive catalysts, but the case for the bulls remains strong.  “For Bitcoin, trying to time it perfectly is risky,"" he said.

42382993,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9thFL,1573852933,Criminal Case Against Failed WEX Crypto Exchange Points at Russian Law Enforcement,"The formerly anonymous administrator of the cryptocurrency exchange WEX, which shut down last summer, has made some shocking claims about the fate of ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars of clients' cryptocurrency in talks with Russian police.  Russian citizen Alexei Bilyuchenko, who confessed to being the tech administrator of the infamous BTC-e exchange and later co-founder of WEX, had been questioned as part of a criminal investigation underway in Russia since late 2018, BBC News Russian reported Friday. The report was based on materials of the probe, obtained by the BBC and reportedly confirmed as genuine by two sources ""close to the investigation.""  In his statements, Bilyuchenko said he was forced to send all the cryptocurrency in WEX's wallets to unnamed staffers of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor of the Soviet KGB, shortly before the exchange ceased operations.  The admin further said he had been close to Alexander Vinnik, the alleged operator of BTC-e, which has been linked to the massive Mt. Gox hack and was shuttered by the FBI in July 2017. When Vinnik was arrested in Greece to face deportation to the U.S., Bilyuchenko, who was with Vinnik at the time, immediately fled for Russia, he told investigators.  Back in Russia, Bilyuchenko used the database of BTC-e users to launch the WEX platform, together with OTC trader Dmitri Vasilev, the official owner of WEX at that time.  However, after business quickly slumped, Vasilev reportedly told a local media source that he'd negotiated the sale of the exchange to Dmitri Khavchenko, who'd been a militia fighter in the war in Eastern Ukraine. Khavchenko is also said to have links to Konstantin Malofeev, a Russian oligarch who is believed to be a sponsor of the pro-Russian separatist forces in the war in Ukraine, as per the BBC report.  According to Bilyuchenko's police statements, in the summer of 2018, right before WEX collapsed, he was in talks with Malofeev, who wanted to obtain the database of the WEX users, presumed to be for a new crypto exchange named Vladex, the BBC says. Malofeev has previously denied links to WEX to the BBC, and would not comment for the latest report saying it was ""based on fabricated materials,"" the broadcaster says.  According to an audio tape from the investigation, also obtained by the BBC and reportedly verified by audiovisual forensics experts, Malofeev, who is known to be close to the Kremlin, wanted to open a government-friendly exchange and was pressing Bilyuchenko to hand the users data over to Vladex via a former FSB officer the report says is ""probably"" Anton Nemkin.  Via a representative, Nemkin denied any links to Bilyuchenko or his business activities, the BBC said, though he is linked publicly to Vladex.  Bilyuchenko also told police that two current FSB officers, named Igor and Grigori, made him give away the flash drives holding all the cryptocurrency of WEX users and transfer it to their wallets — assets worth about $450 million, he said. Bilyuchenko said he met the officers several times in 2018 in the FSB building and Lotte hotel in the center of Moscow.  Neither the Russian police nor the FSB would comment on the matter when asked by the BBC.  Troubled history  BTC-e, one of the first and largest crypto exchanges, had been operating since 2011 and closed by the FBI in 2017, as its alleged operator Alexander Vinnik was arrested in Greece following indictment by a U.S. court on multiple money laundering charges.  Soon after Vinnik was arrested, WEX opened, promising to return users' funds. The individuals running both BTC-e and WEX have always maintained anonymity, talking to the users under pseudonyms in the exchange's trollboxes and on the Bitcointalk forum.  After a year, WEX ceased operations and froze all withdrawals. CEO Dmitri Vasilev sold the entity to Dmitri Khavchenko (now his daughter is the nominal owner of the exchange) and left Russia.  Millions of dollars worth of crypto left WEX's wallets for other exchanges between July and October 2018, CoinDesk reported at the time. Users started filing police reports in October and several separate investigations have reportedly been launched in several cities in Russia and Kazakhstan. WEX's former CEO Vaselev was arrested this summer in Italy on request of the Russian police but released soon after.  BTC-e employees were also alleged to be involved in the hack of Mt. Gox, and are claimed to have funneled about 530,000 bitcoin to BTC-e's wallets, according to the U.S. indictment. This September, Russian law firm ZP Legal offered Mt. Gox creditors a deal in which it would recover the stolen funds, citing the Russian roots of the theft.  Last month, it became known that MT. Gox trustee Nobuyaki Kobayashi had contacted the U.S. Department of Justice requesting information on Alexander Vinnik's alleged involvement in the Mt. Gox collapse.

42382981,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9th1V,1573851603,"Stablecoin Crisis Could Wreck Global Finance, Fed Warns in New Report","The U.S. Federal Reserve Board on Friday warned that a stablecoin crisis could wreak havoc on the global economy and outlined the steps issuers must take to protect the status quo.  The central bank’s prognosis – buried deep in the November edition of its semiannual “Financial Stability Report"" – rests on a stablecoin worst case outcome: a run on the issuers, in which coin holders panic en-masse and demand the return of the fiat they staked.  Stablecoins are a form of cryptocurrency that maintain their value by staking themselves to fiat reserves. While the volatility of bitcoin, the most widely-owned cryptocurrency, is a favorite talking point of its detractors, stablecoins are digital currencies backed 1:1 with a fiat asset or basket of currencies, and designed to maintain a steady value.  The report’s concern is that something could go wrong with the way the stablecoin works – be it, with operations, liquidity, or credit. “This loss of confidence could lead to a run,” it said.  “In an extreme scenario, holders may be unable to [liquidate], with potentially severe consequences for domestic or international economic activity, asset prices, or financial stability.”  Since the fraught launch of the Libra stablecoin concept in June, the Fed Governors, along with U.S. regulators and counterparts abroad, have been sounding alarm bells. Beyond the digital currency question, the integration with mass consumer social network could be disastrous, the report warns.  “Stablecoin initiatives that are built on existing large and cross-border customer networks, such as Facebook’s Libra, have the potential to rapidly achieve widespread adoption,” the report said, echoing comments made by Fed Governor Lael Brainard last month.  But now condensed into a single document, the report consolidates and formalize regulators’ concerns and notes the steps required to prevent a stablecoin catastrophe.  The Fed’s report said:  Issuers must disclose how their staking mechanism works  Issuers must protect customer data privacy while maintaining KYC records to prevent illicit use  Issuers must disclose their terms of service  Issuers must inform customers if they have any rights to the underlying asset  “As the Group of Seven has noted, ‘no global stablecoin project should begin operation until the legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and risks outlined [in this report] are adequately addressed, through appropriate designs and by adhering to regulation that is clear and proportionate to the risks.’”  Federal Reserve image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/15/stablecoin-crisis-could-wreck-global-finance-fed-warns-in-new-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b049079d14d1564034b513bd09534c1dcd8f2ed-1500x886.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382997,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9thGb,1573850531,Tether to File Motion to Dismiss Class Action Lawsuit Based on NYAG Claims,"Tether has released a letter of intent saying that it plans to file a motion to dismiss the lawsuit that claims it manipulated the crypto market.  The class action lawsuit seeks retribution for damages of more than $1 trillion. It’s based on an allegation made by the New York Attorney General’s office in April that USDT was not backed 1:1 by U.S. dollars and a study published by professors at the University of Texas at Austin alleging that a single account used USDT to drive up half the price of bitcoin’s 2017 surge.  The letter, sent to the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York, claims that the plaintiffs’ lawsuit ignores a subsequent version of that academic paper where the authors withdrew one of its central allegations - that trading patterns reveal the issuance of unbacked Tethers.  Last week, in a statement, Tether described the revised paper as “a watered-down and embarrassing walk-back” of the first version. As for its reserves, the company also points to the Transparency section of their website that shows $4.5 billion in assets, with a $100 million cushion above its liabilities.  In the letter, Tether also claims that the plaintiffs could not prove Tether and Bitfinex, the exchange that issues Tethers, were responsible for the transactions that occurred or that the traders actually suffered injury from the market crash.  The letter also refuted claims that Tether had monopoly power over the stablecoin market, had participated in racketeering, and committed common law fraud among other allegations.  The original lawsuit, filed by David Leibowitz, Benjamin Leibowitz, Jason Leibowitz, Aaron Leibowitz and Pinchas Goldshtein, was filed by Vel Freedman and Kyle Roche – the lawyers who won a federal case against Craig Wright. Bitfinex, Tether, Digfinex and current executives; former chief strategy officer Philip Potter; and payment processor Crypto Capital are named as defendants in the case.

42382995,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9thE5,1573843375,"As Bitcoin Cash Hard Forks, Unknown Mining Pool Continues Old Chain","UPDATE (22, November 12:30 UTC): The rogue bitcoin cash chain ceased mining on the old consensus protocol, Bitcoin ABC 0.19.0, after 25 blocks, according to BitMEX Research.    --------    A rogue chain has developed during a planned bitcoin cash hard fork, as an unknown mining pool failed to update to the new chain's software.  The on-going chain battle, which should be resolved by bitcoin cash's internal rules, gives an insider look into how proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanisms operate.  The hard fork occurred on Friday at 16:49:28 UTC at block number 609,135. Two additional blocks broke into two different chains that have been mined for a total of 4 new blocks, according to BitMEX Research’s Fork Monitor.    The Bitcoin Cash chain split continues....        The shorter original rules chain has been extended by one addiitonal blockhttps://t.co/U9hbK4peip pic.twitter.com/lynovM9oVb    — BitMEX Research (@BitMEXResearch) November 15, 2019      The old chain, Bitcoin ABC 0.19.0 mined by the unknown pool, considers the new chain invalid while the new chain, Bitcoin ABC 0.20.06 mined by mining pool BTC.com, considers the old chain invalid.  But under the Nakamoto consensus mechanism employed by bitcoin cash and other proof-of-work (PoW) protocols, the chain with the longest history would be considered to be the trusted ledger, invalidating the rogue chain.  Seeing old chains continue has happened before as some miners, who run software that creates the blocks forming the chain, forget to upgrade to the new software required for hard forks before the forking date.  As BitMEX Research noted in a tweet, mining the wrong chain comes at a cost.  The opportunity cost for mining the incorrect chain could reach up to 25 BCH, or about $6,600, if the unknown pool had beat other miners in securing the two correct blocks, in addition to the electricity costs associated with mining.

42382999,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9thKN,1573842029,Chainalysis Says BitForex Trading Volumes Could Be Fake,"BitForex exchange could be faking its bitcoin trading volume, according to a report released Friday by crypto auditors Chainalysis.  For every one bitcoin recorded entering on-chain between January and November, BitForex claims some 40,000 bitcoins trades traded, the Chainalysis report said. That compares to most leading exchanges average with about 6 bitcoins traded to one on-chain.  “There should be a relationship with the bitcoin moving onto the exchange and how much it is traded,” Philip Gradwell, chief economist for Chainalysis and compiler of the report, said.  The findings of the report were announced at the Chainalysis Links conference in New York.  BitForex did not respond to requests for comment on Friday.  More tools to out fakes  The Chainalysis report comes as crypto entities apply more pressure to exchanges suspected of fake trading volume, with new tools to track suspicious activity and more metrics to rout out likely fakers.  The problem is widespread. According to a Bitwise Asset Management report presented to the Securities and Exchange Commission in March, nearly 95% of bitcoin trading volume is faked.  BitForex could represent a small slice of that fake volume. Its reported ratio is far higher than the top 10 exchanges by volume in the Bitwise 10, a metric of leading exchanges. While those average a ratio of 6:1, BitForex's is the outlier at 40,000:1.  In an interview, Chainalysis's Gradwell said exchanges gain popularity and users by ranking high in trading volume. Comparing the practice to SEO, or search engine optimization, the digital strategies websites deploy to increase their Google standing, Gradwell said the higher exchanges rank, the more visible they are to customers, the more customers will come.  This incentivizes reporting high trading volumes, even if the exchange manipulates their data to misrepresent reality. Gradwell said that comes at the customers' cost.  ""It's really going to degrade the trading experience,"" he said. ""If you're a new entrant to crypto, and you think you're going to a popular exchange - that actually has faked volume - it's not going to be a very liquid exchange. You're not going to get the best prices, or be able to buy or sell quickly.""  Fake volumes, real impact  Investigators, researchers and market manipulators turn to BitForex for its comparably lax standards (the exchange is known to practice transaction mining) and past research also suggests BitForex may not be truthful in its reported figures. A July exchange volume report by Alameda Research scored 48 crypto exchanges on a variety of criteria; BitForex failed five of the six tests.  ""It creates a broader harm for the industry,"" Gradwell said - institutions cannot trust a marketplace whose participants routinely cook their books.  But the Chainalysis report also showed that industry participants react to negative exposure. Chainalysis examined 12 exchanges that were likely faking trading volume in 2018 – including Bithumb and Huobi. After a suspicious spike in late 2018, and the subsequent media coverage, the exchanges began reporting volume with ratios more consistent with the market leaders.

42382979,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9th0F,1573838251,China Is Poised for Another Crypto Trading Crackdown as Speculative Fever Returns,"Financial regulators in China appear set to crack down on cryptocurrency trading again after President Xi Jinping's praise for blockchain technology revived speculation in the sector.  Regulators in each district of Shanghai must search and inspect local crypto exchange-related services before Nov. 22 and report to the central bank for further actions, according to an official notice signed by the Shanghai Internet Finance Rectification Agency and the Shanghai Bureau of the People's Bank of China.  The notice emerged online on Friday. Chinese business publication Caixin confirmed its authenticity in a report published later that evening. The effort is led by the Shanghai government's finance bureau, Caixin said.  The move underscores China's complicated relationship with emerging decentralized technologies. In his speech earlier this month, President Xi called on his countrymen to ""accelerate the development of blockchain technology,"" and China has long been a favored location for bitcoin miners. On the other hand, the government banned crypto-to-fiat trading and initial coin offerings (ICOs) two years ago, near the height of the bubble. Crypto-to-crypto trading remained accessible.  According to the notice, regulators in each district of Shanghai are required to look for any entity that is organizing virtual currency trading activities inside China, or ICOs using a blockchain.  Promotional and brokerage services inside China for ICO projects that are registered outside of the country also fall under the inspection scope of the local financial regulators.  Caixin said speculation on crypto has reemerged in China following President Xi's speech earlier this month.  Social media ban  Meanwhile, China's social media platform Weibo has banned users from publishing any posts that contain ""blockchain"" and ""crypto trading"" at the same time.  Such content ""contains information that violates related laws and regulation or Weibo's community terms,"" according to the message that pops up when a user tries to mention both terms. It is not clear when the restriction was put into place, and as of Friday, it was still possible to publish the phrase ""crypto trading"" or ""blockchain,"" just not together.  The Shanghai government's notice also comes at a time when some exchanges are expanding their local presence to tap into the Chinese market.  Binance, which has a dedicated team in Shanghai, recently rolled out peer-to-peer trading on its platform that enables users to buy or sell cryptocurrencies using Chinese yuan through bank wires, AliPay or WeChat. However, shortly after Binance's feature release, AliPay clarified that no official relationship between it and the exchange exists and all over-the-counter transactions are “closely monitored” for bitcoin or other virtual currency activity currently barred by AliPay's policies.  On Nov. 14, Binance's official Weibo account was abruptly suspended by the social media platform for ""being complained [about] for violating laws and regulations.""  The exchange said that the suspension was due to a ""malicious report"" filed by some users to the social media platform and it's appealing to Weibo to reopen the account. Similarly, the official Weibo account of blockchain project Tron was suspended on Nov. 15.  A few weeks ago, a little-known Beijing-based cryptocurrency exchange called Biss, which claims to offer a channel for Chinese investors to buy U.S. stocks using cryptocurrency, was reportedly under investigation by local police. The exchange said in an announcement on Nov. 4 that some of BISS' operational staff are ""actively assisting the investigation by authorities.""

Specifically, the GUIGOZ Bio 2 and 3 infant milk range will be traced on the blockchain platform as a means to provide consumers with more information on the milks origins and transparency on product checks, Carrefour said in an announcement on Thursday.

While such schemes may have an element of marketing, there's no doubt that breakdowns in food safety – such as China's melamine-adulterated milk scandal and the more recently reported Polish distribution of diseased meat – have raised concerns over what we are being fed.  Other major firms – like Cargill and Walmart – have moved to utilize blockchain tech ease those concerns, in theory, providing consumers with immutable proof that their food comes from where it's supposed to and hasn't been adulterated along the way.

42382984,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9th93,1573824625,Ukrainian Railways Branch Caught Mining Crypto With State Power,"In the latest instance of state employees mining cryptos at work, a unit of Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia) has been caught red-handed diverting company electricity to earn bitcoin.  State-owned Ukrzaliznytsia said in an announcement on Friday that its security department and law enforcement officials had discovered that branch employees in the western city of Lviv had secretly been running a bitcoin mining farm, costing the state over $40,000 in power. Oleg Nazaruk, director of the railway's Department of Economic and Information Security had apparently reported the finding.  “During the inspection of the premises where the so-called farm was located, more than 100 pieces of computer equipment were identified that were generating bitcoins. The aforementioned equipment was connected to the Ukrzaliznytsia power grid. The estimated amount of losses since the beginning of the year is UAH 1 million [$41,332],” Nazaruk said.  Creating and and circulating cryptocurrency is prohibited in Ukraine under central bank rules, Ukrzaliznytsia said.  The nation has been working on bringing in comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation for several years, a legislative effort that seems to be at last moving more rapidly. Most recently, crypto exchange Binance was said to be assisting Ukraine with developing rules for the industry.  A criminal case has now been launched over the illicit Lviv mining effort and evidence from the branch has been sent to police, Ukrzaliznytsia said.  The temptation to use company power or equipment to make easy money mining cryptocurrency is one that state employees seem to struggle to fight.  Last year, several scientists working at a Russian nuclear weapons research facility were arrested for mining cryptocurrencies onsite. Ukraine’s top law-enforcement and counterintelligence agency also found mining equipment at a nuclear power plant this August. Elsewhere, Florida state employees, Chinese teachers and Australian government contractors have all got into hot water over their secret mining efforts.

42382982,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9th2l,1573812621,"BRICS Nations Ponder Digital Currency to Ease Trade, Reduce USD Reliance","The BRICS association of major emerging economies has discussed developing a digital currency to ease trade in the bloc and reduce its reliance on U.S. dollars in settlement.  The possibility was raised by the BRICS business council at a meeting in Brazil amid talks on the development of a new payments system between its five member nations, Russian news source RBC reported Thursday. Formed in 2006, BRICS is aimed to boost economic and political cooperation between Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.      Kirill Dmitriev, director general of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) – the entity that looks set to build the system – told reporters after the event that the forum had mulled a single cryptocurrency for settlements between members. The decision to move forward with that part of the plan is not yet been taken.      Nikita Kulikov, member of the State Duma’s expert council and founder of PravoRobotov Autonomous Non-Profit Organization, told RBC that, rather than being a digital form of money, the BRICS digital currency would likely be used to facilitate trade transactions.  “Most likely, it will be like certain obligations that can be transferred from one legal entity to another to confirm that the recipient will have claim rights, and the contractor will have obligations for a specific amount. It will not be money, we can say that it will be a paperless document flow to facilitate transactions,” he said.  If that turns out to be the case, the project appears more like trade finance blockchain platforms such as Marco Polo, which has recently started working with Russian firms. Indeed the use case for blockchain, or distributed ledger technology, is seen as being bright in the world of trade finance, with a number of efforts underway, including We.Trade, TradeWindow and Voltron.  Such platforms reduce the traditional reams of manually prepared and distributed paperwork, allowing a realtime view into the agreement and status of a trade for all participants to see. They can also have automated settlement, powered by smart contracts, built in to fulfill trade obligations when certain conditions (such as a delivery) are met.  The new payments system, which would use members' national currencies, appears in part to be aimed at reducing BRICS nations' reliance on the U.S. dollar, and perhaps boosting the Russian ruble's role in trade. Dmitriev said BRICS has already reduced its use of USD in settlements over the last five years from 92 to 50 percent, while ruble-based transactions climbed from 3 to 14 percent.  Such blockchain-based threats to the role of the dollar internationally are soon potentially to rise in scope and severity, with the apparent imminent launch of China's digital yuan and hints that the EU may develop its own e-euro. The Facebook-led Libra project has also raised U.S. regulators hackles, presenting as it does an alternative to USD for Facebook's billions of global users.

42382988,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9th6X,1573805705,What the CFTC Chairman Actually Said About Ether Futures and Ethereum 2.0,"The Takeaway:  CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert said last month that ether is a commodity, and he expects to see regulated ether futures in the U.S. in the next six months.  The ethereum network is expected to transition from its current proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake model over the next year, in an upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0.  Asked about this shift, Tarbert said Tuesday the CFTC is still evaluating whether ether will remain a commodity under the new model.  Ethereum developers and proponents believe proof-of-stake may actually bolster the case that ether is ""sufficiently decentralized"" to be considered a commodity in the eyes of U.S. regulators.      U.S. regulators are not yet sure about what to make of ethereum's impending transition to a staking-based protocol.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Heath Tarbert, who recently declared his view that the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is a commodity that could support a futures market, said this week his agency is still evaluating whether this will remain true after ethereum upgrades its network sometime in the coming year.  Speaking at CoinDesk's Invest: NYC conference on Tuesday, Tarbert said the CFTC and its sister agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), were both “thinking carefully” about the forthcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade which is designed to replace the coin’s current proof-of-work (PoW) model for transaction validation.  In PoW, computer servers called nodes solve computationally-intensive mathematical equations in order to validate transactions and process new blocks. However, in Ethereum 2.0, these same nodes will stake wealth (in the form of ETH) and vote on new blocks rather than solve for them.  ""Staking is obviously different than mining in the sense that mining is by its very nature sort of more decentralized, whereas with the stake obviously it reduces energy costs because you're just giving it to one validator or line of validators,"" Tarbert said Tuesday.  The CFTC, which has been looking into ethereum and its potential shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) since at least December 2018, is now looking into how decentralized the ethereum network will be after the 2.0 upgrade. In addition, Tarbert said regulators are also examining the requirements expected of users to run nodes on the Ethereum 2.0 network.  ""That's exactly the kind of analysis that that we're undertaking and the SEC is undertaking right now,"" Tarbert said.  This analysis will be key for any evaluation and eventual approval by U.S. regulators for a regulated ether futures market – which according to Tarbert’s earlier statements is “likely” in the next six to 12 months.  What’s at stake  According to Jehan Chu, managing director of Hong Kong-based crypto investment firm Kenetic Capital, a regulated ether futures market would be game changing in the U.S.  “What regulated futures will do is allow institutional investors to trade this commodity,” Chu said. “They’re not going to be logging on to Bitmex and trading in size. They will potentially on Bakkt, the NASDAQ, etc. This is why you need to have regulated financial instruments and why CFTC’s commodity designation is so important.”  Adding to this, Aaron Wright, founder of ethereum startup OpenLaw, said another core benefit of a regulated futures market would be better “price discovery” for ether.  “Without futures, it's more difficult for those that think the price of ether is overvalued to signal that to the market,” said Wright. (According to recent remarks by former CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo, the introduction of bitcoin futures in late-2017 brought BTC prices back down to earth.)  Some industry experts say both the demand and maturity of ethereum as a technology is still far too nascent for a futures market to be supported in the U.S. This is because ethereum futures contracts do trade on exchanges based outside of the U.S. – such as on U.K.-based Kraken Futures – but trade volumes for these contracts are relatively thin.  Still, the most ardent supporters of ethereum are optimistic about the successful delivery of Ethereum 2.0. In fact, most believe the case for a regulated ether futures market is only strengthened in light of the upcoming transition to PoS.  There are two reasons why.  1. 'Better decentralization’  In June 2018, the SEC’s director of corporation finance, William Hinman, argued ether was not a security based on the understanding of the ethereum network as a “decentralized structure.”  Danny Ryan, an Ethereum 2.0 researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, explained one of the key aims of ethereum’s PoS network is “better decentralization.”  “With [PoW], there is some intrinsic centralization due to the hardware component tied to the real-world supply chain in which some people are more entrenched and can get more specialized hardware than average consumers,” said Ryan, adding:  “In ethereum’s PoS, the capital that you need to acquire to participate is much more readily available. … Converting capital into an asset that allows you to stake in the protocol is much cleaner.”  Eric Conner, founder of information site ETHHub and product researcher at blockchain startup Gnosis, said the minimum cost for an Ethereum 2.0 validator to process blocks and earn rewards like a miner would on ethereum today is 32 ETH or roughly $5,800.  According to Connor, this is a comparatively lower barrier to entry than in PoW where “you would have to buy thousands of [machines] because the hash power on the network is so high.”  “What’s interesting about proof-of-stake is that it takes away miner centralization,” Conner said.  To this, Collin Myers, head of global product strategy at ConsenSys, the Brooklyn-based ethereum venture studio, estimates Ethereum 2.0 is targeting roughly 15,600 validators to secure the network at launch. Currently, there are only about 7,000 computer servers running ethereum software around the world.  2. Expectations of profit  Currently, miners on ethereum are randomly selected to process new blocks on the network. By devoting higher amounts of computational energy to the network, miners have a greater chance of being selected to create a new block and earn rewards.  In Ethereum 2.0, validators, who are the equivalent to miners in a PoW network, earn rewards on a more regular and predictable basis. Rather than using up computational energy, validators lock up 32 ETH as collateral to the network and earn rewards in the form of interest on their staked wealth.  “Although the chance for reward is much more regular and frequent on PoS, the amount which you are rewarded as a validator is still related to your ability to participate well in the protocol,” said Ryan. “There is not an expectation of profit by doing nothing and through the work of others. It’s all related to your ability to provide services to the network.”  Indeed, outside of staking, validating transactions and appending new blocks in the PoS network, validators are also expected to actively attest to the validity of a block in a shard or the primary PoS blockchain, called the beacon chain. This happens every six minutes in the new network, according to the Ethereum Foundation.  “I don’t think it changes anything to be honest. Ether is a commodity as far as the … CFTC is concerned. I don’t see a reason why proof-of-stake would change that,” said Gnosis researcher Conner, adding:  “It’s actually very similar to how proof-of-work works today when it comes to reward issuance.”  A blurred line  Given that both efforts for regulated ether futures in the U.S. and Ethereum 2.0 are still largely theoretical, it’s difficult to draw a correlation between how one might impact the other, according to Chu of Kenetic Capital.  “In my mind, the [ETH 2.0] roadmap isn’t impacting the markets yet. I don’t think it’s going to impact a [possible] futures market until … some major milestones come into place,” said Chu.  What’s more, the actual criteria influencing how U.S. regulators make their decisions on what is or is not a security when it comes to cryptocurrencies is still highly uncertain, according to Felix Shipkevich, a New York attorney with a specialization in litigating on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.  “We still don’t have clarity from the SEC on what type of tokens are securities and what are not,” Shipkevich said, adding:  “Please explain to me, what does [the SEC] mean by decentralized? What is truly decentralized? … We do not have a legal definition of what decentralized versus centralized ledgers are and why bitcoin and ethereum in the eyes of the SEC [and CFTC] are not securities.”  To put things in perspective, the only other cryptocurrency in the world that has been granted commodity status within the United States is bitcoin. As recently as September, the first physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts were launched and made available for trading on the regulated digital assets platform Bakkt.  However, Shipkevich said bitcoin does not behave in a similar way to other traditional commodities. The majority of people buying bitcoin (and similarly ethereum) do so with the intention to speculate on the asset and earn high returns, Shipkevich said, adding:  “These two cryptocurrencies are treated more like [equity] assets than truly cryptocurrencies. People buy bitcoin today because they want to hold and speculate on bitcoin.”  Whatever the reason, Chu said he is confident U.S. regulators know more about these two cryptocurrencies than they are currently letting on.  “I’m not concerned about the relationship between ether futures and ETH 2.0,” said Chu. “You don’t issue all of these enforcement actions without understanding what you’re enforcing.”  Watch Heath Tarbert's full remarks at Invest: NYC 2019  Nikhilesh De contributed reporting.
