Zhao Dong, a Bitfinex shareholder who first revealed the exchange was thinking of doing an initial exchange offering (IEO) earlier this week, posted on WeChat Wednesday that individuals interested in participating should reach out to either him or to DFund, a group he founded.  There will be a minimum buy-in of $1 million, and a total supply of 1 billion tokens, available for $1 each, Zhao wrote. He further claimed that $500 million has already been subscribed.  ""Only qualified foreign investors will be allowed to invest,"" he wrote, and they must make a ""soft"" commitment to the sale by Sunday.  Once investors have been able to review the token's white paper, they can choose to cancel their soft commitment or convert to a hard commitment, with a 10 percent deposit.  ""The system works on a first-in, first-served basis,"" Zhao added. ""If the whole [1 billion is] fully allocated, we will not have to run the IEO to the retail channel, it will be like a private placement.""  It is unclear how exactly the proceeds would be used, though it is possible the exchange will look to use the funds to make up for an $850 million shortfall it suffered last year after its payment processor's funds were seized by national authorities.  Hybrid token  Zong described the token as a ""hybrid"" of BNB, the token issued by Binance that can be used to pay trading fees on that exchange, and BFX, the token Bitfinex issued to customers who lost money in a 2016 hack, which was convertible to equity and was fully redeemed the following year.  ""Bitfinex will destroy [the] token with full unfrozen funds in the future, in addition to referring to the logic of BNB token,"" he wrote.  Neither Zhao nor a spokesperson for Bitfinex immediately responded to requests for comment.  The New York Attorney General (NYAG) revealed that Bitfinex lost access to the funds last week, and had received a $625 million transfer from stablecoin issuer Tether – which shares executives and some ownership with the exchange – to cover up the shortfall.  Tether also offered Bitfinex a line of credit, granting it access to as much as $900 million. The NYAG froze access to that line, though a New York Supreme Court justice ruled Tuesday night that the attorney general's office must justify this order.

42430440,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMt8fh,1556741132,MakerDAO Demos Tech to Back Stablecoin DAI With Any Crypto Asset,"Borrowers of U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin DAI will soon be able to be back their loans in any number of cryptocurrencies, at least if a new web portal is ultimately implemented.  On a weekly community call organized by the MakerDAO Foundation – the non-profit entity that funds the development of the programmatic lending software that issues DAI tokens – product coordinator Chris Bradbury walked users through what the new web page will look like and how the tool will function for users.  At present, over $300 million worth of the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) is locked in smart contracts on ethereum to back DAI dollar valuation. This accounts for nearly 2 percent of all existing ETH in circulation.  The implication of the demo then is that instead of users staking only ETH, they will soon be able to stake virtually any other token or coin that's approved by MakerDAO token holders.  This list of acceptable DAI collateral like other decisions impacting the wider MakerDAO lending protocol will move through a voting process in coming months before the mainnet launch of multi-collateral DAI, as stated in a MakerDAO Foundation blog post. So, it's not clear at this time which assets will be approved.  Testing for the upgrade has been ongoing since September on the ethereum testnet Kovan. Now, work on a new web portal for users to loan out multi-collateral DAI is also underway.  This portal, like the one currently available for single-collateral DAI, will give users a simple interface to take out a DAI loan – also called a “Collateralized Debt Position” (CDP) – from the MakerDAO system.  It will also act as a dashboard for users to see what loans they have taken out from the MakerDAO system and what types of collateral have been staked.          CDP dashboard for new multi-collateral DAI web portal. Presented by Chris Bradbury.    Most notably, in the new CDP portal, any cryptocurrency wallet can be used to pay back loan debt. It does not have to be a specific user’s designated crypto wallet.  All CDPs, Bradbury explained, will have their own designated public webpage that anyone can connect to and pay down outstanding debt for. This will ensure that users no matter where they are or what wallets they have access to can still manage loan deposits from virtually anywhere in the world.  Bradbury added during today’s call that the CDP portal will also be “a lot more mobile-responsive than the previous [portal],” giving users the flexibility of managing or tracking their CDPs more easily on their cellular devices or smart phones.  “It’s still super early,"" said Bradbury during today's call.

Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, testifying on ""the state of the CFTC"" before the U.S. House Agriculture Committee on Wednesday, said in his opening remarks that the clearinghouses his agency regulates are ""critical single points of risk in the global financial system"" which continue to grow and become more complex.  Clearinghouses are financial institutions that facilitate transactions between two parties, acting as intermediaries to ensure trust on all ends. The CFTC routinely examines these entities to identify any possible issues that may affect their ability to monitor or control their risks, Giancarlo told lawmakers. ""The importance of these examinations to overall financial stability are all increasing.""  The agency regulates a number of registered clearinghouses within the U.S., as well as six located overseas and has exempted four foreign clearinghouses. This number will grow, Giancarlo said – especially with the introduction of crypto futures.  He added:  ""The Commission anticipates new applications for clearinghouse registration resulting from the explosion of interest in cryptocurrencies; an area in which protection of the cryptocurrencies will be one of the highest risks.""  Crypto derivatives provider LedgerX operates as a clearinghouse already, while platforms like ErisX are still waiting for the CFTC to approve their applications to become derivatives clearing organizations (DCOs), which is a necessary designtation to operate as a clearinghouse.  Market intel  Giancarlo also addressed LabCFTC, the regulator's fintech research group created to keep up with changing technology.  During his remarks, the Chairman highlighted blockchain and cryptocurrencies as two aspects of ""rapidly changing markets and technological developments.""  LabCFTC was able to help the regulator anticipate some of this development and what an appropriate regulatory response might be, he said.  In particular, the CFTC has been able to independently analyze market data ""without being reliant on self-regulatory organizations and market intermediaries,"" he said.  Moreover, the CFTC was able ""to determine the value of technological innovations,"" he said, citing ""crypto-asset-based futures products"" as an example.  CME and Cboe both announced they were launching cash-settled bitcoin futures products at the end of 2017, and ErisX, LedgerX, Seed CX and Intercontinental Exchange's Bakkt all plan to offer physically-settled bitcoin futures and forwards once they've achieved the necessary regulatory approvals.

CoinFlip, a crypto ATM startup, had planned to add the Tron version of USDT to more than 180 of its machines, allowing people to buy the token for cash at convenience stores, gas stations and tobacco shops across the U.S.  But according to Daniel Polotsky, co-founder and CEO of CoinFlip, this plan has been put on hold due to the NYAG's court case involving Tether, the issuer of the token, and Bitfinex, the cryptocurrency exchange with overlapping management and owners.  ""Given the news, we are going to be postponing our launch until the smoke clears (if it ever does),"" Daniel Polotsky, co-founder and CEO of CoinFlip, told CoinDesk Wednesday, adding:  ""We want to make sure Tether and Bitfinex are operating 100% lawfully before offering their products to our customers.""  Tron has also postponed a $20 million rewards program that was designed to encourage adoption of its version of USDT.  The blockchain project had planned to work with Huobi, OKEx and other exchanges to airdrop Tron-based USDT and encourage users to migrate their tokens from the Omni protocol (where USDT initially was issued and where the biggest part of its supply still lives) to Tron, with offers like 20 percent annualized interest rate on their holdings.  However, the reward program was postponed ""until there's more clarity regarding Bitfinex and Tether,"" Tron CEO Justin Sun tweeted Wednesday.  USDT is designed to trade 1-to-1 with the U.S. dollar, and for most of its history, it has done so, despite longstanding questions about its cash reserves.  New York Attorney General Letitia James revealed last week that Tether had loaned more than $700 million to Bitfinex, because the latter was unable to access more than $800 million held at a payment processor.  As a result, the roughly 2.6 billion of USDT outstanding are now only 74 percent backed by cash and equivalents, as Tether's general counsel acknowledged.  Awkward timing  Stepping back, Tether has issued USDT via Omni (which runs on top of the bitcoin blockchain) since 2014, but in recent years it's launched versions of the token on other networks.  The ethereum version of USDT debuted in 2017, and in March of this year, Tron and Tether announced their partnership.  The rationale for Tron was, according to the firm, the chance to boost liquidity for decentralized applications and make Tron more accessible to institutional investors by providing a stablecoin option.  ""The stablecoin will allow users to access the DAPP ecosystem with a more familiar USD concept, and therefore mitigates the effects of price fluctuations, providing a better cash-in/cash-out and risk-avoiding method for DAPPs and enabling scalable application of DAPPs,"" Tron's blog post said on April 2.  Since April 16, Tether has issued 137.9 million of the dollar-pegged tokens on the Tron network. This is still a drop in the bucket compared to the Omni protcol's tethers, of which more than 2 billion are outstanding.  In a live video ""ask-me-anything"" session on Twitter on April 25, Sun told his 1.11 million followers:  ""Tether is the largest stablecoin in the crypto world. Every USDT is backed up by, like, one USD actually in a reserve, so it's a fully backed USDT.""  Later that day, news broke of the attorney general's investigation.  Asked Tuesday if Tron received any proof of the USDT token's fiat backing from Tether, Tron spokesperson Cliff Edwards told CoinDesk:  ""We don't comment on private negotiations and correspondence between two parties. That said, I will tell you we have assurances that TRON-based USDT is backed by fiat.""  Edwards would not elaborate on the details of those ""assurances.""

42430437,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMt8Xh,1556730019,Ex-Ripple CTO Launches Blogging Platform to Pay Content Creators XRP,"Cryptocurrency startups are increasingly eyeing content creators as a key use case.  Coil, the San Francisco-based startup founded by former Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas, just opened the public beta on its blogging platform designed to help scribes earn XRP.  Since the closed beta started in August 2018, roughly 1,000 test users have been paying in-browser subscriptions for a monthly rate of $5. Comparable to Spotify, Coil then automatically pays the content creators in XRP based on usage while the user enjoys the flat subscription fee.  Thomas told CoinDesk the new Coil.com blogging platform is working with the digital wallet provider Stronghold for dollar cash-out options in addition to XRP. Initially, the goal is to allow free access with tipping and payment options for bonus content.  “Every participant can decide what currency they want to use,” Thomas said. “Part of the next phase is really to experiment with what works, both from a creator’s side – where the constraints are, ‘How do I get some good quality bonus content without investing a huge amount of effort?’ – and from the users’ perspective of, ‘What will people actually sign up for?’”  Avi Kabani, the author of several nonfiction books about love and relationships, told CoinDesk that so far he’s earned 21 XRP, nearly $6, through Coil and XRP tips. Meanwhile, he’s spent nearly $20 worth of XRP watching Twitch users. So far, it appears Coil has enabled a circular economy within the XRP community.  “I typically like to save [XRP] in my [Coil] balance to support other creators,” Kabani said, adding he’d love to use the Coil blogging platform in addition to his social media channels. “It's also good to know that XRP is liquid enough so that if someone does need fiat they can get it.”  Likewise, early Coil user and Forbes contributor Thomas Silkjær told CoinDesk he looks forward to seeing Coil integrations replace some publishing paywalls.  “You pay per second you are visiting a website. But the underlying technology is much more capable,” Silkjær said. “Imagine paying per kilobyte streamed of video, or paying for time spent reading articles otherwise walled by paywalls and subscription.”  Competing options  While Coil is uniquely focused on time spent on the page, it is hardly the only tool offering micropayments directly to content creators.  Starting in 2016, the privacy-minded web browser Brave has offered a rewards program for content creators, with payouts to bloggers, YouTubers and publishers denominated in the company’s Basic Attention Token (BAT).  In 2018, the lightning blog Yalls facilitated 20,000 bitcoin invoices in just seven months, while the ethereum-centric platform Cent currently hosts more than 50 blogs that earned creators between $55 and $326 worth of ETH in the past 30 days. By comparison, the Coil subscription earnings appear modest.  However, Silkjær said that Coil’s true potential will only be unlocked when the Ripple-invented interoperability protocol Interledger allows the micropayments tool to support multiple currencies.  “Using Interledger, content creators can define what currency they wish to receive. And no matter if Coil is spending XRP, it will be bridged on the network to match the content creators’ needs: currency-agnostic micropayments,” Silkjær said.  Indeed, Thomas confirmed there are plans to leverage Interledger for a variety of cash-out options, from diverse cryptocurrencies to direct bank transfers.  “We think of it as a platform for publishing and it’s built on open standards so it is more interoperable than past publishing platforms,” Thomas said, adding:  “The standard that we’re built on, called Web Monetization, is intended to be a browser standard someday. But in order to be a browser standard, first you have to show some market traction, so that’s what we’re building out right now.”  Image of CEO Stefan Thomas courtesy of Coil",POSITIVE,BAT | XRP,BAT | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | XRP,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/05/01/ex-ripple-cto-launches-blogging-platform-to-pay-content-creators-xrp,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83cf748c31685163850064d4b9cdd7a8d94d8aae-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430443,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMt8dh,1556725555,Techstars-Backed Alkemi Enters DeFi Race With $16 Million Liquidity Pool,"A new type of decentralized finance (DeFi) app wants to boost crypto-market liquidity by offering you interest on your coins.  Today at the demo day for Techstars' blockchain cohort, Alkemi CEO Ryan Breen will unveil a crypto liquidity pool deal worth $16 million from industry veterans like Joseph Weinberg, chairman of the data network Shyft, and Alex Friedberg of BXB Capital. Alkemi is looking to create a liquidity system for exchanges by making an accessible honeypot that service providers can dip into when demand increases faster than supply.  “It’s solving inter-settlement lag,” Weinberg told CoinDesk, comparing Alkemi’s model to bitcoin-oriented solutions like Liquid. “You have a reduction in fee rate across the space over time because you have general liquidity across the space. You have a faster rate of execution.”  The Alkemi protocol will let users connect their personal wallets to a smart contract via a mobile app that, like a savings account at a bank, allows exchanges to use those funds for settlements while users determine their own lockup timeframes. This isn’t a loan, however, it’s a type of virtual deposit where the user retains custody of the private keys.  “We’re starting with ethereum because that’s where the lion’s share of a lot of the token issuance has been,” Breen said.  While the app, scheduled for launch by 2020 after the protocol undergoes security audits, will eventually support bitcoin, fiat-backed stablecoins, XRP and a variety of other assets, it fits squarely into what Breen called the DeFi movement, which includes the use of smart contracts to experiment with utility and efficiency for self-custodied assets.  Stepping back, the most prominent DeFi projects so far include the loans startup Dharma, the token exchange platform UniSwap and MakerDAO, which is often associated with the ethereum-backed DAI stablecoin. Although DAI has failed to maintain its dollar-peg over the past few months and loan fees continue to rise, DeFipulse.com shows more than $332 million worth of cryptocurrency is currently locked in Maker and Dharma loans alone.  Breen said liquidity across the space remains a hurdle.  “Decentralization by design is dividing and separating the concentrations of wealth. But then you have liquidity [issues] where it actually requires concentrated access to wealth,” Breen said. “We believe that solving the liquidity paradox in the space will involve projects working together, as opposed to one, winner-take-all scenario.”  Communal Access  In order for this to impact the DeFi ecosystem, exchanges and other distribution platforms will need to get on board.  Alkemi is betting that providing liquidity pools will save exchanges and institutional funds money. Those savings are then divided into three parts: app users gain a third of the crypto saved (like interest on a savings account), Alkemi gets a third and the institutional partner keeps the remaining loot.  “The biggest problems arise with surging demand where liquidity dries up,” Frank Schuil, CEO of the Swedish exchange Safello said in reference to the broader market. “Established players have little problems tapping into these [liquidity pools]. More difficult is to get good terms from these parties and agree on settlement arrangements.”  While Safello isn’t a member of the Alkemi consortium, Weinberg said this is precisely the type of friction he hopes the new DeFi startup can address.  Speaking to how integrating with exchanges could reduce price inefficiencies while increasing access among less well-established players like the DeFi protocol Uniswap, Weinberg told CoinDesk:  “A lot of the times you have exchanges that have to re-balance their own books, and not just exchanges, all kinds of liquidity pools. … The question is can you have smart contracts controlled by participants that make the flow of capital more efficient?”  Pool image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MINING | DAI,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/01/techstars-backed-alkemi-enters-defi-race-with-16-million-liquidity-pool,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9fc7b5b80df384b022d0f425a1dded83fdc2477c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The total figure includes over $356 million lost from exchanges (including QuadrigaCX’s $195 million) and over $850 million alleged to have been lost from the Bitfinex exchange by the New York Attorney General’s office last week.  It's worth noting, however, that Bitfinex has claimed the funds have been frozen by various authorities at a payments company and that it is working to retrieve them.  CipherTrace said Tuesday in its “Q1 2019 Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering Report” that the estimated first quarter loss is almost 71 percent of the $1.7 billion loss seen over the whole of 2018.  “These thefts only represent the losses that are visible,” the startup said, adding that the real number of cryptocurrency losses was likely much higher.  Lack of clear regulations in the cryptocurrency sector is the main reason behind the rise in thefts, CipherTrace said, though more clarity is expected in the near future.  According to the report:    “A tsunami of tough new global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terror financing (CTF) regulations will roll over the crypto landscape in the coming year.”            CipherTrace further highlighted what it considers a major gap in the current regulatory environment with respect to cross-border crypto payments.  “An analysis of 164 million BTC transactions revealed that cross-border payments from U.S. exchanges to offshore exchanges increased from 45% from the twelve months ending Q1 2017 to 66% in the twelve months ending Q1 2019,” it said.  Finally, cyber criminals are said to have increasingly adopted new techniques such as kidnapping and insider misappropriations to steal cryptocurrency from individuals and companies in the first quarter.

The effort sees the firms forming a new alliance, dubbed the Data Accountability & Transparency Alliance (DATA), that will discuss ways to tackle concerns over cryptocurrency data reporting in its current state, CoinMarketCap announced Wednesday.  Led by CoinMarketCap, the alliance has notable members at launch including the cryptocurrency exchanges Binance, Bittrex, OKEx, Huobi, Liquid, Upbit, KuCoin, HitBTC Gate.io, OceanEx and Bitfinex, which will provide “in-depth suggestions” on the how to boost transparency at a biannual roundtable event.  CoinMarketCap is also mandating that all exchanges listed on its platform must provide live trading data and live orderbook data. If exchanges fail to do so within 45 days, they will be removed from the platform’s adjusted volume calculations.  Last month, cryptocurrency index fund provider Bitwise Asset Management claimed that 95 percent of all reported bitcoin trading volume is faked and that the true spot market for bitcoin essentially exists on 10 different exchanges.  CoinMarketCap's data at the time indicated that the bitcoin market’s average daily volume is roughly $6 billion, but Bitwise said that the actual average daily bitcoin trading volume was more like $273 million.  “We recognize the need for evolving with the times, and want to continue ... providing transparency and discovery for the long-tail of crypto assets,” said CoinMarketCap founder Brandon Chez.  The data provider has also launched its own block explorers for the bitcoin and ethereum networks aimed to help new users better understand how to interact with blockchains.  Earlier this month, CoinMarketCap also rolled out its first Android app and revamped its Apple iOS product with new features, including portfolio tracking and candlestick charts.

42430436,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMt8Vh,1556709007,Up 28%: Bitcoin Ends April With Biggest Monthly Gain in a Year,"View  Bitcoin activated twin bullish cues with a 28 percent gain in April: a falling channel breakout on the monthly chart and a close above the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA).  Prices have again bounced from the historically strong 30-day moving average support, currently at $5,184. This, coupled with the bullish developments on the monthly chart indicates scope for a rally to $6,000 in the next few weeks.  A UTC close below the 30-day MA at $5,184 would weaken the short-term bullish case and may allow a deeper pullback to the 50-day MA at $4,706.  Bitcoin (BTC) scaled an important price resistance with double-digit gains in April, solidifying the long-term bull breakout witnessed four-weeks ago.  The crypto market leader closed (UTC) at $5,269 on Tuesday, representing a 28 percent gain on the April 1 opening price of $4,092, as per Bitstamp data. That's the biggest monthly gain since April 2018, as discussed yesterday.  Importantly, April's close put prices above the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $5,248.  That EMA had emerged as a strong price floor in the five months to October 2018, forcing many to conclude that the bear market had ended near $6,000. Bitcoin, however, dived below $6,000 on Nov. 14 – falling to lows near $3,100 by mid-December – and, with that, the 21-month EMA became the level to beat for the bulls.  Now that BTC has secured a monthly close above that key hurdle, the long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change confirmed on April 2 looks more credible. As a result, a rally to $6,000 in the next few weeks cannot be ruled out.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $5,300 on Bitstamp – up 2.4 percent on a 24-hour basis.  Monthly chart        As seen on above left, April's candle closed just above the 21-month EMA, the first monthly close above the key average since October 2018.  The bullish close comes four weeks after bitcoin first confirmed long-term bullish reversal by violating the most basic of all bearish patterns – the lower highs and lower lows – with a high-volume break above $4,236 on April 2.  The chart also shows a falling channel breakout, which indicates a bearish-to-bullish trend change. It is worth noting that a similar bearish channel breakout in October 2015 was followed by a 2.5-year bull market (see above right).  Essentially, BTC has activated twin bullish cues – a falling channel breakout and a close above the 21-month EMA – with April's close at $5,269. These developments are remarkably similar to the ones seen in October 2015.  Daily chart  The above chart shows bitcoin has again bounced up from the 30-day moving average (MA), weakening the case for a deeper pullback put forward by the bearish divergence on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).  It is worth noting that BTC has suffered significant price pullbacks following the confirmation of the bearish RSI divergence in the past.  This time, however, the pattern seems to have failed, with the price bouncing up from the 30-day MA, a sign of strong bullish sentiment. As a result, BTC could revisit and possibly breach the recent high of $5,627 reached on April 23.  The case for a temporary pullback to the 50-day MA, currently at $4,706 would strengthen if and when the price closes below the 30-day MA at $5,184.

Blockchain payments processor Bitpay announced the news on Tuesday, saying that the firm has partnered with U.S.-based taxation services provider Refundo for the service.  Refundo customers can choose to receive all or a portion of a tax refund in bitcoin using its CoinRT product. Taxpayers will have to set up an account to get a unique routing and account number to input on their tax return, according to the announcement.  They will also have to provide necessary background information for know-your-customer (KYC) rules, as well as a bitcoin wallet address. Once the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or state has deposited the refund, BitPay will process the payment and send bitcoin to taxpayers’ wallets.  The service is touted as primarily focusing on serving the underbanked community with faster payments and lower transaction fees.  Refundo CEO Roger Chinchilla commented:  “Adding bitcoin was a natural fit for our customers who often do not have traditional checking accounts, pay high check cashing fees and regularly send money internationally. CoinRT enables them to get bitcoin quickly and easily for one flat fee.”  The CoinRT service costs $34.95, regardless of the refund amount. No separate fee is paid by the user to BitPay, the firms told CoinDesk.  Founded in 2011, Bitpay processed over $1 billion worth of transactions last year. The firm has previously partnered with a Florida county tax collector and Ohio state to help them accept taxes in cryptocurrency.

42430438,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMt8Zh,1556703942,Amazon Web Services Opens Blockchain Building Service Up for Wider Use,"Amazon Web Services (AWS), the e-commerce giant's cloud computing arm, has launched its Managed Blockchain service for wider use among enterprise clients.  AT&T, Nestle, Accenture and others are already using the service, AWS announced Tuesday.  Initially revealed last November, Amazon Managed Blockchain is said to allow clients to create and manage blockchain networks more easily and economically using open-source frameworks like Hyperledger Fabric. Until now, the service was previously available only in ""preview,"" meaning interested firms could sign up for approval to use the service.  With that stage now over, the service is available for general production use, said AWS’ chief evangelist, Jeff Barr, in a separate blog post, adding:  “You can create your [blockchain] network in minutes. You can manage certificates, invite new members, and scale out peer node capacity in order to process transactions more quickly.”  Support for the ethereum network is still in the works and is expected to be made available later this year, AWS said.  It's worth noting that the service is currently available only in AWS' U.S. East (Northern Virginia) region, although more areas are expected to be opened up in the ""coming year.""  Nestle Oceania’s digital technology manager, Armin Nehzat, said:  “With Amazon Managed Blockchain, we are able to set up our Hyperledger Fabric network and easily invite our partners to collaborate in our supply chain transparency efforts. Amazon Managed Blockchain will enable our customers to track their products on the blockchain from the farm all the way through to consumption.”  Securities and derivatives trading platform Singapore Exchange (SGX), on the other hand, is working with AWS to move its existing work on Hyperledger Fabric to Amazon Managed Blockchain, said its head of blockchain technology, Andrew Koay.  Accenture, non-profit foundation MOBI (Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative) and enterprise asset management company TrackX are also using the service, according to AWS.

42430439,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMt8bh,1556699405,Digging Deeper on Crypto Exchange Data and Transparency,"Clay Collins is CEO and co-founder at Nomics, an API-first cryptoasset data company delivering market data to institutional crypto investors and exchanges. The opinions expressed in this article are his own, and do not reflect CoinDesk’s position.​  The following article originally appeared in ""Institutional Crypto"" by CoinDesk, a free newsletter for the institutional market with news and views on crypto infrastructure delivered every Tuesday. Sign up here or at the link below.      On March 19th, Bitwise came out with a report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that made two claims of particular interest to us at Nomics.  These claims were:  Only 10 exchanges had actual volume  95 percent of reported exchange volume is fake  As a data company, the first thing we did was look at these exchanges to see what the commonalities were:  What our examination of the Bitwise report has revealed  Eight of the 10 cryptocurrency exchanges identified by Bitwise as good actors provide historical trade level data (i.e. the most granular and audible form of pricing data available). That is, the one thing we found in common among the good actors identified by Bitwise, is they were very transparent about trading activity.  In contrast, we found that every single one of the exchanges explicitly called out by Bitwise as bad actors provides limited trading history and virtually no granularity around trading activity.    Transparency of Exchanges Identified As Trusted vs Suspect, According To Bitwise’s Report    It makes sense that opacity around exchange data would be correlated with fake volume, toxic activity, and wash trading. Indeed, just like an IRS audit, the more data history and granularity provided by an exchange engaging in nefarious activities, the more likely they are to be caught.  We’re excited about the Bitwise report (and the prospect of a Bitwise ETF). But, we also believe the Bitwise report left some questions unanswered (which we assume will be addressed in due time, given the cadence and thoroughness of the regulatory process they’re undergoing).  Two things about the Bitwise report surprised us:  First, the lack of scrutiny around the report, particularly by Crypto Twitter, which has a reputation for being an all-out war zone.  Second, the degree to which the public took a document meant to market the approval of Bitwise’s ETF to the SEC, and overgeneralized the findings to apply to all exchanges (even ones not analyzed by Bitwise) and all cryptoassets. Indeed, Bitwise only demonstrated explorations of BTC/USD and BTC/USDT pairs.  I believe the crypto community’s response to the report lacked criticism and nuance. Don’t get me wrong, as a bitcoin hodler I want this ETF to be approved. But I believe the claims made by the report are just too large and global to take at face value, and that a more nuanced conversation needs to be had.  Our six critiques of the Bitwise report and the public’s response:  The report’s primary purpose is to persuade the SEC to allow a Bitwise ETF. For this reason, it has an inherent bias. That is, the document is a marketing document first, and a research document second.  The report seems to have a “base 10 bias.” The number 10 seems very curious: why not 9 or 11?  Their conclusions are not falsifiable. Bitwise is looking at the data and giving individual exchanges a thumbs up/down. There is no stated independent test that stands apart from Bitwise that a third party can independently apply. You either have to trust their conclusions or not. (Note: Bitwise has informed me that they will be sharing a more falsifiable methodology in the near future).  The cryptosphere has responded to the report as if its conclusions are stuck in time; there is far too much over-extrapolation. Because Bitwise does not state a formal methodology that can be used to independently rate an exchange, a third party cannot update the list. So today, some of the exchanges identified by Bitwise as being good actors might have flipped and be engaging in wash trading. And exchanges that Bitwise did not indicate as having “actual volume” may have cleaned up their practices.  People have over-extrapolated the report to apply to cryptoassets other than bitcoin, to markets other than BTC/USD & BTC/USDT, and to exchanges that don’t list bitcoin. This report, as it stands right now, does not apply to other cryptoassets, to pairs other than with USD & USDT, and exchanges other than the 80 they examined (all of which list bitcoin). While Bitwise’s analysis was perfect for a bitcoin ETF, it’s a mistake to apply their findings broadly to all crypto markets.  The public’s response to the report has been unfair to upstanding exchanges not examined by Bitwise. Too many readers have given the report a cursory glance and concluded that there are only 10 exchanges with true volume: this is an incorrect assumption.  Conclusion  Much of the response to Bitwise’s report has involved restricting volume analysis (and market data in general) to the 10 exchanges identified as having “actual volume.” However, this reduction in scope results in analysis that’s stuck in time; it also over-extends Bitwise’s findings to cryptoassets other than bitcoin, and exchanges that don’t have BTC/USD or BTC/USDT markets.  But the real problem with restricting global cryptosphere analysis to just 10 exchanges is that it shifts our reliance from one centralized provider (e.g. CoinMarketCap) to another (e.g. Bitwise). Instead, as an industry we need to get iteratively better at spotting suspect exchange behavior on a near real-time basis. And we need formal open source methodologies that can be used by any independent third party to evaluate exchange activity in real time.

42430435,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMt8Rh,1556695819,Where Crypto Exchanges Are Beating the Bear Market,"With the Turkish lira dropping to a six-month low against the dollar last week, bitcoin is continuing to pick up even more traction in Istanbul.  Andy Cheung, head of operations at the global crypto exchange OKEx, told CoinDesk that over 30,000 Turkish users signed up for the platform since it expanded services to Turkey on March 26. Turkey’s growth as a leading bitcoin market is supported by other data as well.  “Turkey is without a doubt the only country that boasts of a high percentage of independent crypto-ownership in Europe and the Middle East,” Cheung said. “It has one of the most robust and promising crypto communities anywhere in the entire world.”  The lira accounts for 6 percent of crypto-fiat liquidity in 2019, CoinMarketCap data shows, retaining its 2018 rank as the fifth most popular fiat-to-crypto pair worldwide. According to BtcTurk CEO Ozgur Guneri, inflation is slowly, yet consistently, driving Turkish demand for bitcoin.  Guneri told CoinDesk his crypto exchange has also on-boarded more than 30,000 new users so far in 2019.  Those sign-ups speak to the relatively high crypto adoption rates in Turkey. A survey conducted in April 2018 by the media arm of ING Bank found that Turkey already had the highest percentage of bitcoin holders in Europe, with 18 percent of Turkish respondents saying they own cryptocurrency. (Globally, Turkey had the highest rate of respondents who expected to hodl long-term, at 45 percent, compared to 21 percent of crypto owners in the United States.)  “We have never seen a declining number of users, just the pace of growth might go down a little bit. Even on the most bloody day, we’re signing up new users,” Guneri said, adding that BtcTurk’s retail arm has already seen several days in April with $14 million worth of volume.  While these numbers may seem small compared to US unicorns like Coinbase, Turkish traders have garnered growing influence in the global marketplace.  Fluctuating inflation has been a primary driver of crypto adoption among Turkish traders, Guneri said. For example, when the lira dropped roughly 20 percent against the dollar in a single day in August 2018, BtcTurk’s trading volume jumped more than 100 percent.  “The U.S. dollar and the euro, in my opinion, are not hard money anymore but bitcoin is,” Guneri said. “Bitcoin is the new generation’s store of value, and sometimes a way of speculating, of course.”  Global players  Meanwhile, Guneri’s Istanbul-based exchange launched institutional services for foreign investors for the first time earlier this month, BtcTurk Pro, in order to capitalize on crypto-to-fiat arbitrage opportunities.  Guneri told CoinDesk:  “The volatility of the Turkish lira is quite high and couple that with the price of bitcoin … and we have a market that is illiquid enough that sometimes there are inefficiencies that you can benefit from. Yet we are liquid enough for institutional investors to operate.”  Due to Turkish exchanges’ strict listing and on-boarding policies mandated by relationships with local banks, many traders acquire their first bitcoin domestically then send the digital loot to global exchanges with a wider range of trading pairs and fiat liquidity options.  “Some users can increase their investments in bitcoin during the volatile periods of the Turkish lira,” Turkish vlogger Alp Işık told CoinDesk. “Turkish users generally use local exchanges as a gateway to foreign exchanges.”  All things considered, Işık and Guneri both see crypto adoption continuing on a steady upward slope, correlated with volatility for both the lira and bitcoin.  Referring to competition among exchange platforms around the world, BtcTurk’s Guneri said:  “There is definitely a global space for [crypto-to-crypto], but I think there will be a consolidation in terms of real volume. … There will be significant value in local markets and local knowledge.”  Istanbul image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/01/where-crypto-exchanges-are-beating-the-bear-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a46f39b13bbd5c189c3f52369acf6c20e30ebcf0-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
