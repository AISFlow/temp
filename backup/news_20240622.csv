A more in-depth examination of the chart reveals two earlier instances in which Trader Tardigrade identified similar patterns for Dogecoin and the Gaussian Channel. The first time the Gaussian Channel turned green was in 2016, allowing DOGE to go on a multi-year journey, which saw it setting multiple all-time highs in 2018. A similar pattern occurred in 2021 and 2022, which saw DOGE surging astronomically to peak at its current all-time high. How High Can It Drive Dogecoin Price? Of course, no one can predict exact price targets. However, if history is to repeat itself, DOGE is expected to exhibit bullish action for the next few years. According to the analyst, a potential surge could see DOGE break past its current all-time high into new price territory. His most optimistic outlook has Dogecoin breaking past its $0.73 this year and entering $1 by 2025. Trader Tardigrade noted a final price target well above $6.5, representing an increase of over 5,100% from the current price level.

At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.1235 and is down by 9.44% in the past seven days amidst a broader market decline. There are many price resistance levels to overcome before investors can be confident of a DOGE rally.

These bullish signals suggest that the token could soon make a significant move to the upside. Interestingly, crypto analyst World of Charts has predicted that Polygon could enjoy a 1,000% rally when this move happens. Related Reading: AI Crypto Fetch.ai (FET) Makes ‘Big Bounce’ – Volume Spikes Over 200% Ahead Of Merger Polygon To Rise To As High As $5 World of Charts predicted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Polygon could rise to between $4 and $5 in the midterm. He made this prediction while stating that this might be the last chance to accumulate MATIC before the solid bullish wave, which he expects to happen soon enough. He suggested that this move for Polygon could occur during the imminent altcoin season. Interestingly, the crypto analyst expects Polygon to rise much higher than $5 in the long term. From the chart he shared, he hinted at the crypto token rising to as high as $40 by year-end or sometime in 2025. Meanwhile, he stated that a price between $10 and $12 was an “easy target” for MATIC. Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that most of Polygon’s on-chain metrics are bullish, which could help contribute to the crypto token’s move to the upside. One of these metrics is the large transactions, which have been on the rise recently, suggesting that crypto whales are actively accumulating the crypto token. Furthermore, Polygon looks well positioned to enjoy a significant rally when the given altcoin season kicks off, considering that the Spot Ethereum ETFs are believed to be what will trigger this run for altcoins. That means that the rally could begin in the Ethereum ecosystem, where Polygon remains one of the most prominent Ethereum-based tokens. Time To Flip Bullish On Polygon Crypto analyst CrediBUL Crypto also recently suggested that Polygon’s bullish reversal was on the horizon. He revealed that he had been going short on the crypto token for a while now but stated that it was almost time for him to flip bullish on Polygon. Crypto analyst Mayor of Matic also recently highlighted a wedge pattern on Polygon’s pattern and stated that the breakout above the wedge will be “powerful.” Crypto analyst Crypt Kaleo had earlier in March highlighted Polygon’s chart and suggested that the crypto token was looking well primed for that move. As such, considering how long it has consolidated since then, this parabolic move could happen sooner rather than later. However,it remains to be seen if MATIC can rise as high as $5 as World of Charts predicted.

29815128,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625932,1719070203,Bearish Wave Hits Solana: SOL Drops Below $140 – More Losses On The Horizon?,"Solana, a leading blockchain platform, is experiencing a significant downturn as a persistent bearish wave sweeps through its market. This decline, driven by a combination of factors, has led to SOL’s price suffering a huge drop below the $140 support mark. Solana’s price has struggled to find stability, breaking through key support levels and signaling further potential losses. As bearish sentiment continues to dominate, traders and investors are closely monitoring the situation, seeking signs of a possible reversal or additional declines in the near future. Technical Indicators Signal Further Losses For Solana On the 4-hour chart, the price of SOL is beginning to decline again after a failed attempt to move upward. It should also be noted here that the digital asset is still actively bearish trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) also suggests that Solana may be poised for a further decline as the signal line of the RSI indicator is attempting a reversal below 50% dropping toward the oversold. From the 1-day chart based on the current price movement, it can be observed that SOL is still actively bearish as it is still trading below the 100-day SMA. It can also be noticed here that it is attempting to start moving downward by dropping a rejection candlestick. Also, the RSI indicator reveals that SOL’s price may likely decline further as the RSI line is actively trending below 50% heading toward the oversold zone. It is worth noting that from the analysis and technical indicators on both the 4-hour and 1-day chart, it can be suggested that the price of SOL may extend its decline for a while. Potential Scenarios For SOL’s Price Movement Presently, Solana has broken below the $140 mark and is attempting a downward move toward the $118 support level. If SOL’s price breaks this level, it will continue to move down to test the $99 support level and may probably move on to test other lows if it breaches below this $99 level. However, if it fails to move downward as predicted and breaks above the $140 mark, it will start a move toward the $160 resistance level. Should it break above this resistance level, it will continue to move upward to test the $188 resistance level. Furthermore, Solana may witness a higher climb to test the $205 resistance level on the chart if it breaks the above support level and possibly heads on to create a new high. The price of SOL has decreased by 0.57%, trading at about $133 in the last 24 hours, with a market capitalization of more than $61 billion and a trading volume of more than $1.9 billion as of the time of writing. There has been a 12.94% increase in market capitalization in the last day despite the trading volume being down by 9.84%.

This rapid climb in transaction volume for such a young network suggests a growing appetite for TON’s capabilities, particularly for facilitating large transfers of digital assets. On-chain metrics of $TON are going parabolic! “The transfer volume ranges between $5.0B ~ $10.0B. For comparison, #Bitcoin‘s average daily transfer volume is around $50.0B. This indicates that #TON has already achieved between 10% Bitcoin’s capacity.” – By @JA_Maartun Read… pic.twitter.com/56VjsAGOwL — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 20, 2024 Related Reading: Tron’s USDT Triumphs: Daily Volume Climbs Above $53 Billion, Dwarfing Visa Crypto analysis reveals a tenfold increase in TON token holders over the past year, skyrocketing from 2.9 million to over 30 million. This surge in user adoption suggests a growing trust in the network and could potentially pave the way for a more robust and vibrant TON ecosystem. A larger user base translates to a wider pool of developer talent, increased opportunities for innovation, and ultimately, a stronger network effect that attracts even more users. Messaging App Integration: A Catalyst For Crypto Adoption? The unique advantage TON possesses lies in its connection to Telegram, one of the most popular messaging apps globally, boasting over 900 million users. This integration has the potential to be a game-changer for crypto adoption. Challenges Ahead For Toncoin However, there are still hurdles to overcome. The regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies remains complex, and TON will need to navigate these challenges to achieve mainstream adoption. Additionally, questions linger about the scalability of the TON network. Can it handle the massive influx of users that Telegram’s integration might bring? Meanwhile, as TON boasts impressive growth in users and transaction volume, its token price hasn’t quite mirrored this enthusiasm. In the last 24 hours, TON has dipped 0.5%, and over the past week, it’s down 10.4%.

This trend was mirrored across almost all large-cap assets, many of which experienced significant losses. Unfortunately, recent price action data suggests that the Bitcoin price is not safe yet, as there is potential for further downside over the coming days. Is $60,000 The Next Stop? In a new report, blockchain intelligence firm CryptoQuant put forward an interesting prognosis for the price of Bitcoin based on its recent movement. According to the analytics platform, the premier cryptocurrency could be headed for the $60,000 price mark after losing a significant support level. Related Reading: Survival of the Fittest: Here’s How Bitcoin’s Next Rally Hangs on Miner Capitulation On Tuesday, June 18, the Bitcoin price fell below 65,000 for the first time in over a month. The price of BTC didn’t stay beneath this level for too long, as it quickly climbed back to $66,000 by Thursday. However, the premier cryptocurrency succumbed to the bearish pressure, falling as low as $63,500 on Friday, June 21. In its analysis, CryptoQuant postulates that the price of Bitcoin is currently beneath the vital $65,800 level, which is the trader’s on-chain realized price. This price indicator can act as a support level, signaling an impending decline if the BTC price breaks it to the downside. According to CryptoQuant, every time the Bitcoin price crosses beneath the on-chain realized price, it undergoes an 8-12% correction, which explains the $60,000 price target. Interestingly, the waning on-chain metrics of the market leader support this bearish projection. As explained by CryptoQuant, traders’ demand for Bitcoin has continued to decline, as the short-term holders are not purchasing BTC but rather decreasing their holdings. Meanwhile, the demand from large investors (whales) currently lacks the strength often associated with bullish momentum. Furthermore, stablecoin liquidity has been on a steady decline, putting a strain on the Bitcoin bull run. For instance, the 60-day growth in Tether USD’s (USDT) market capitalization has slowed down from $12.6 billion in late April to $3.7 billion as of now — the slowest growth rate since November 2023. Naturally, higher stablecoin liquidity is required to kickstart price rallies in the crypto market. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the Bitcoin price continues to hover around $64,000, with a 1.2% decline in the last 24 hours. In the past two weeks, the premier cryptocurrency has decreased in value by nearly 8%, according to data from CoinGecko.

Lookonchain data reveals USDT transactions on Tron hitting a staggering $53 billion in a single day, exceeding Visa’s daily average of $42 billion. This 20% lead underscores the increasing adoption of stablecoins for everyday transactions. The 24-hour trading volume of $USDT on #TronNetwork is $53B, exceeding Visa’s average daily trading volume. Visa’s trading volume in Q1 2024 was $3.78T and the average daily trading volume was $42B. pic.twitter.com/jolGKIUcxE — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 21, 2024 Why The Rise Of Stablecoins? So, what’s driving this surge? Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies known for their wild price swings, stablecoins offer a haven of stability. They are typically pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, meaning their value remains relatively constant. This stability makes them ideal for everyday transactions, eliminating the fear of sudden price drops that plague traditional cryptocurrencies. Additionally, stablecoins leverage the power of blockchain technology, enabling faster, cheaper, and more transparent transactions compared to conventional systems. Regulation On The Horizon As stablecoins gain traction, governments are scrambling to establish regulatory frameworks. The Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act in the US and similar initiatives in the UK highlight a global concern for ensuring user protection and financial stability in the face of this innovation. While these regulations are crucial for responsible growth, navigating the ever-changing political climate adds another layer of complexity. For instance, the UK’s crypto policy remains uncertain with a looming general election. Related Reading: Follow The Whales? Arthur Hayes Buys Pendle, Token Soars 25% The Future Of Finance Despite the challenges, the momentum behind stablecoins seems unstoppable. Their ability to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world offers undeniable advantages. While daily transaction volume can be volatile, and concerns like rising transaction fees on Tron need to be addressed, the overall trend is clear. Stablecoins are here to stay, and their impact on the global financial system is likely to be profound. As regulations take shape and the technology matures, stablecoins have the potential to revolutionize the way we conduct everyday transactions, ushering in a new era of financial inclusion and efficiency.

According to data from CoinMarketCap, the “Ethereum Killer” is down by 6.36% on its weekly chart, emerging as the biggest loser among the top 10 tokens. Interestingly, this price dip depicts the larger negative performance of SOL in which it has lost 24.61% of its value in the last month. However, amidst this mayhem, the Solana network has hit a significant milestone which may spark some excitement for investors. Related Reading: Solana Could Face A 41% Crash, Warns Mechanism Capital Co-Founder Solana Records All-Time High Of 30 Million Monthly Users In an enthralling development for SOL enthusiasts, data from blockchain analytics platform Artemis shows the network has attained a new peak of 30 million active addresses (users). This development was shared on X on Friday by the data analysis handle SolanaFloor. After reaching the 25 million mark in 2022, the Solana blockchain experienced a steep decline in monthly active users going as low as 5 million in 2023. However, the smart contract platform has appeared rather attractive in 2024 with a steady rise in monthly users throughout the year so far. In the crypto ecosystem, the importance of growth in network users stems mainly from an indication of growing market confidence from investors, which is quite vital considering SOL’s current price dip. For the fifth largest cryptocurrency, this rise in the active addresses is likely due to the current hype around Solana meme coins – a $5.65 billion ecosystem that has provided investors with an avenue of recording insane trading profits. In addition, an increase in network users can also translate into larger liquidity, more stable network security, and the development of more use cases, all of which are important features in attracting further investment and boosting a token’s value. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Solana Brace For Quiet Q3: What Crypto Traders Should Know What’s Next For SOL? At the time of writing, SOL trades at $133.36 following a 0.34% decline in the last day. Furthermore, the token’s daily trading volume is down by 6.81% and valued at t $2.19 billion. For Solana, the bulls face strong resistance at the $151 price zone. If the buying pressure proves sufficient to push through this region. SOL could return as high as $190 over the next few weeks. However, a rejection at this zone could result in a further decline in the token’s price reaching as low as $120.

One whale, in particular, has caught the attention of the SHIB community following a massive withdrawal from the popular crypto and stock trading exchange Robinhood. Whale Pulls Out Almost $40 Million From Robinhood The Shiba Inu whale transactions that have got tongues wagging were first picked up on June 20 by the on-chain whale tracking platform Whale Alert. According to the report, the whale had removed a total of 2,2 billion SHIB from the exchange, which was worth approximately $40 million at the time of this transfer. Related Reading: Dogecoin Enters Final Stage Of Consolidation, Analyst Predicts 6,150% Rally To $7.5 The whale moved the coins to an unknown wallet, something that could be bullish for the price. This is because when whales move their coins to exchanges, they intend to sell, which might push the price down due to the selling pressure. However, when whales remove their coins from exchanges, it could mean they don’t plan to sell and are holding for better prices. In this case, the whale has gone the way of the latter, suggesting accumulation rather than selling. Also, given the sheer volume of coins being withdrawn from the Robinhood exchange, it has removed a significant amount of supply from the open market from now. However, the whale transaction hasn’t had much of an impact on the price. The SHIB price is still trading under $0.00002 at the time of this writing, although this presents ample opportunity for these investors looking to get in at cheap prices. Shiba Inu Still Has Legs Despite the price decline that has rocked the meme coin in recent times, expectations have not waned as analysts forecast another crypto bull market. One of those who still see a bright future for the meme coin is Shiba Inu marketing lead LUCIE. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Worldcoin (WLD) Price Surged Over 15% In One Day To Reach $3 According to LUCIE, SHIB is still in a position. Sharing a Wall Street Cheat Sheet, she shows that the meme coin is now in the period just before Optimism. Now, the Wall Street Cheat Sheet shows that this is when investors really begin to believe that the rally is real. From here, the price is expected to keep going up as investors go through the motions of Belief, then Thrill, and finally Euphoria, before prices start to correct. If LUCIE is right, then the real rally is yet to begin and the Shiba Inu price could go so much higher. At the time of writing, the SHIB price is struggling to reclaim the $0.000018 support from the bears. However, with the Bitcoin price failing to move upward, the weekend could bring further declines for the market.

29789328,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625862,1719016250,Is Bitcoin’s Rally Over? New Insights from CryptoQuant Predict a Market Downturn,"According to the latest insight from a CryptoQuant analyst, Bitcoin might be poised for a notable price correction. This possibility of a price correction is based on major Bitcoin metrics such as the Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (ASOPR), signaling a notable implication for Bitcoin’s trajectory. Understanding ASOPR’s Role In Predicting BTC Corrections The ASOPR, a key indicator in the crypto market, measures the profit ratio of spent outputs by comparing the value at which coins were bought to the value at which they were sold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Below $66,000 Stuns Market, Why A Drop To $54,930 Is Possible According to the CryptoQuant analyst, when this ratio exceeds 1, it suggests that coins are being sold at a profit, which often correlates with bullish market conditions. However, a critical threshold observed in historical data is when ASOPR approaches 1.08. At this point, the market tends to shift, signaling a potential onset of a correction phase. This pattern has been consistent over several market cycles, providing a valuable tool for investors to assess the market’s health. For instance, when ASOPR climbs steadily above 1 but nears the 1.08 mark, investors might consider this an opportune moment to evaluate their positions before potential downturns. The CryptoQuant analyst particularly noted: Considering past instances where similar patterns were observed, there is a possibility that the current situation might follow the same (down) trend. Another critical component the analyst mentioned in his BTC market analysis is the 200-day moving average (MA), widely regarded as a barometer for the long-term market trend. This indicator helps smooth out price data by creating a constantly updated average price, which can be pivotal in confirming the overall market direction. A rising 200-day MA suggests a long-term uptrend, while a decline might indicate a bearish market. According to the chart shared by the analyst, Bitcoin’s performance below this key moving average currently confirms the cautious stance suggested by the ASOPR. With the price hovering around $64,000, a 14% drop from its recent peak, the convergence of these indicators suggests that the market might still be in a phase of reassessment and potential adjustment. Bitcoin Continued Stagnancy The prediction from the metric above is quite evident, as Bitcoin’s value continues to fall despite significant positive developments within the industry. Earlier today, Standard Chartered Plc announced the launch of a new trading desk for Bitcoin and Ethereum, marking a significant move into spot cryptocurrency trading by one of the world’s major banks. Additionally, the Winklevoss twins, founders of the crypto company Gemini, have publicly supported Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, donating $1 million each BTC for being a “pro-Bitcoin” candidate. Related Reading: Bitcoin Analyst Claims BTC Consolidation Will Continue, Hedge Funds Throw In The Towel Nevertheless, these developments have not spurred any significant upward movement in Bitcoin’s price, which has seen a 1.1% decline in the past 24 hours to $63,935. Analyst Ansem predicts that Bitcoin may not see a significant price increase until later this year, anticipating it will remain between $58,000 and $60,000 for some time.
