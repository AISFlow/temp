42426379,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN63h,1433528724,Bitcoin Stolen at Gunpoint in New York City Robbery,"An unidentified 28-year-old man was robbed of more than $1,100 in bitcoin at gunpoint in New York City late last month.  The robbery took place after the man, from Crown Heights, Brooklyn, met up for an in-person bitcoin sale arranged over online classifieds platform Craigslist on 27th May, according to a report by DNAinfo.  A representative for the New York Police Department (NYPD) confirmed the report when reached.  The NYPD said that the seller was led to a vehicle after meeting up with the presumed buyer. He was subsequently forced, at gunpoint, to transfer his bitcoins to the two assailants.  The identities of those involved in the incident are unknown at this time.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/06/05/bitcoin-stolen-at-gunpoint-in-new-york-city-robbery,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cd698d190af59d8a86c16d23d608cfab7cd24f09-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426388,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN6Hh,1433525136,"Bitcoin in the Headlines: BitLicense Arrives, But Wild West Remains","Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly look at bitcoin news, analysing media and its impact.  Bitcoin's Wild West days may be numbered, or so the headlines would have us believe.  This week saw the release of the final version of the BitLicense, New York's long-awaited, and still heavily debated, state-specific regulation for bitcoin businesses. Unsurprisingly, the news was extensively covered in the media, and often heralded as a milestone in the evolution of the emerging technology.  Many stories used legitimizing language and headlines that foreshadowed that bitcoin had taken yet another step toward inclusion in the wider financial world.  However, the technology's growing pains were still on display this week, as it continued to be associated with illicit Deep Web-based activities and development issues dogged one of its most well-funded startups.  Milestone legislation  The victory lap for the BitLicense came swiftly following its 3rd June release, with the mainstream narrative all but arranged to trumpet the government's stamp of approval.  The Wall Street Journal's Michael J Casey wrote a piece, which noted:  ""Outgoing New York Superintendent of Financial Services Benjamin Lawsky released sweeping new rules for licensing digital-currency businesses in the state Wednesday, staking part of his legacy on launching a specialised regulatory regime for an industry that many experts believe could play a significant role in the financial system.""  In the article, Casey quoted Lawsky's statements in which he voiced his belief that the legislation struck the appropriate balance between protecting customers and rooting out illicit activity, while showing commitment to not ""doom promising new technologies before they get out of the cradle"".  ""Whereas some have questioned why existing money transmission regulations can't be used for virtual currency businesses, Mr Lawsky said those Civil War-era laws simply wouldn't work for digital currency, a technology unlike anything we had ever seen before,"" said Casey.  More marginalized were the many dissenting voices who occasionally appeared in such content, arguing that the BitLicense would discourage the same spirit of innovation that propelled the early Internet.  Extensively covered by Western mainstream media, the news was also picked up by less likely outlets around the world, showcasing the technology's growing appeal abroad.  Kommersant, a Russian Daily, ran a headline which implied bitcoin had been legitimised as a digital currency; a loosely translated version read: ""Cryptocurrency Recognised A Full Part of The Financial Market"".  The article said:  ""The key provision of the new rules is that now all the companies that work with cryptocurrency, you must have a special license from the Department, which should improve the safety of customers and transparency of operations cryptocurrency.""  Such articles could no doubt have an influence on coming conversations regarding regulation that is seeking to ban the technology in Russia under rules for monetary surrogates.  Nail in the bitcoin coffin  It wasn't all good news for bitcoin.  Following Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht's life sentence last week, it was not surprising to see how the debate around bitcoin's use in illicit activities was reignited.  Forbes published a piece by Jason Bloomberg in which the author outlined the digital currency's link to the Deep Web.  He wrote:  ""Silk Road kingpin Ross Ulbricht's recent conviction and life sentence was more than simply a crackdown on a massive online black market for illegal drugs. It was a nail in the coffin for the radical new cryptocurrency bitcoin, as bitcoin was the glue that held Silk Road together.""  Backtracking slightly, Bloomberg asked how significant the demise of Silk Road was for bitcoin, noting that this was part of an ongoing debate.  ""Controversy, however, is nothing new for bitcoin. In fact, it seems the story of this digital currency consists of nothing but controversy,"" he wrote, adding: ""In fact, perhaps the greatest challenge for bitcoin is divining the technology's true purpose. Early innovators often espoused radical Libertarian goals for revolutionising the banking system and with it, the world economy"".  ""By disintermediating third parties, bitcoin promised to usher in a new world order free of market commerce,"" noted Bloomberg.  Despite this, the author proves seemingly negative about bitcoin's performance.  ""Bitcoin soon became a haven for criminals – not just Silk Road, but any number of money launderers and other shady types who gravitated toward an anonymous, relatively safe method for conducting financial transactions, in particular across national borders,"" he said.  'Total crypto breakdown'  Elsewhere, Blockchain struggled to right its news narrative, which has been marked by the kinds of security issues that may be alarming given that it closed $30.5m in funding late last year.  The Guardian ran a piece with an alarmist headline given the small number of users apparently affected, writing:  ""Blockchain has issued an update for the Android version of its bitcoin wallet after discovering a critical failure which breaks the cryptocurrency's security.""  Whether intentional or not, the latter seems to imply that Blockchain's bug could potentially affect bitcoin as a whole, as opposed to just users who store their holdings on Blockchain's wallets.  Writer Alex Hern explained:  ""Bitcoin wallet application Blockchain has rushed to release an update after a critical bug left multiple users unaware that they were sharing a bitcoin wallet, leaving their cryptocurrency completely unsecured.""  He continued: ""The bug affected users running Blockchain’s app on Android version 4.1 or older [...] it resulted in one specific address being generated multiple times, leading to a loss of funds for a handful of users.”  According to Hern, the bug was due to a series of questionable development choices:  ""Bitcoin wallets are typically created by randomly generating a public address and a related private key. As a result, it is important for address and key to be truly random, or else it may be possible to guess the private key by looking at the public address.""  It seems that Blockchain used two sources to create the random numbers, pulling a random number from Android's built-in generator, and then connecting to online service Random.org to obtain the second combination.  Hern noted that on some Android devices, the built-in random number generator failed to connect and report back Blockchain's app.  Then, the battering continued.  Michael Mimoso wrote a piece for Threat Post with ""Crypto Calamity For Blockchain Android App"" as its headline.  Describing Blockchain as one of the busiest bitcoin wallets, the article said: ""Shoddy crypto is being blamed for the loss of bitcoin for an unnamed number of Blockchain users.""  It seems that New York's plans to regulate digital currency companies, at least for now, will do little to help solve the pain points for companies still struggling to gain wider adoption.

42426390,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN6Ph,1433520401,Consensus 2015: What the Internet Can Teach Blockchain Innovators,"Digital currencies remain an exciting new technology striving for mainstream adoption, but their struggle is not without precedent – The consumer and technical roadblocks they face are akin to those overcome by key Internet protocols.  Two new Consensus 2015 speakers will look back at the mainstreaming of e-commerce and Internet security, providing a deep dive into the historical lessons that could come to shape the technology's future.  Last April the Heartbleed Bug was uncovered, revealing that the majority of websites on the Internet were vulnerable to information theft.  The bug was caused by a flaw in OpenSSL, a hugely popular cryptographic software library that encrypts data flowing through servers. According to the Netcraft Web Server Survey at the time, more than two-thirds of active Internet sites ran on two widely used open-source servers that relied on OpenSSL.  The news sent bitcoin developers scrambling since the Bitcoin Core at the time used the compromised cryptographic library.  Security pioneer... and Nick Szabo's boss  These are the sorts of Internet-wide events that Christopher Allen has been observing for over 20 years, as a co-author of the reference implementation of the SSL 3.0 protocol.  The SSL protocol and its successor TLS were adopted as a key Internet security standard, enabling applications as diverse as e-commerce and online banking.  Allen is now working on projects in the blockchain space, most recently with Revoke SSL, which was presented at a Blockchain University demo day last month.  By moving into blockchain technologies, Allen is revisiting familiar territory. As the founder of Consensus Development in the 1990s, he counted the pioneering e-money firm DigiCash among his clients. In 2000, after merging his firm with Certicom Corp and becoming chief technology officer there, he hired renowned cryptographer Nick Szabo to work on smart contracts.  ""I've been wanting to do smart contracts since before they were called smart contracts,"" Allen said.  Allen will draw on insights developed from working on SSL and TLS's adoption as protocol standards for the Internet – in the face of competing technologies from companies like Visa, Mastercard and Microsoft – and the lessons for digital currency and blockchain technologies at Consensus 2015.  E-commerce and financial services giant  A key use of the secure data flows enabled by SSL is e-commerce. It's also seen as one of the major growth components of the burgeoning digital currency economy: investment dollars have poured into merchant processors like Coinbase, Bitnet and BitPay.  One firm that holds the distinction of operating one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms is Japan's Rakuten. It reported revenues of $4.8bn last year, putting it ahead of firms like GroupOn, JD.com and Netflix.  Notably, the e-commerce giant also derives nearly 40% of its revenues from financial services, ranging from its own digital bank to life insurance.  Rakuten  is putting some of its financial services and marketplace knowhow to work for Bitnet, the merchant payment processor that it invested in last October. The man who led that investment is Oskar Miel, a managing partner at Rakuten FinTech Fund.  Miel's role is to find ways for his portfolio of startups to work with Rakuten's various divisions. He will discuss Rakuten's perspective on the relationship between merchant processors and marketplaces in the mass adoption of digital currencies at Consensus 2015.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/06/05/consensus-2015-what-the-internet-can-teach-blockchain-innovators,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51bd53ffd29f0afb332471f9f0e69b8aace140b8-1500x1125.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Speaking at the Exponential Finance conference in New York, Masters who joined bitcoin trading platform Digital Assets Holdings as CEO in March, said:  ""Distributed ledger technology does have the potential to be disruptive of certain business models. But it has at least as much potential to be enormously empowering of existing business models in terms of making them lower cost, more efficient and less risky.""  The CEO, who also discussed smart contracts and the potential benefits of blockchain tech for trading, seemed positive about mainstream adoption in the future.

42398405,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTRKc,1433498797,NYSE Chairman: Millennials Trust Bitcoin More Than Fiat,"Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) CEO and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) chairman Jeffrey Sprecher has come out in support of bitcoin and the blockchain, voicing his belief that the technologies are part of a larger change in how trust is being established in society.  Speaking to CNBC's Bob Pisano on ""Power Lunch"", Sprecher opened up about NYSE's investment in bitcoin services provider Coinbase's recent $75m Series C funding round, one of the largest so far closed by an industry firm.  Sprecher suggested NYSE has been looking into bitcoin and the blockchain for ""over a year"", but noted the exchange has found the language of the industry difficult to navigate.  However, Sprecher said his interest had persisted due to the fact that millennials are becoming comfortable using the technology in the same way that they are becoming used to other platforms – such as ride-sharing app Uber – where the crowd, rather than a central authority, informs decision-making.  Sprecher told CNBC:  ""We're seeing millennials trust a currency that is created in the ether, more than they trust fiat currency by government. I think that trend, whether it's a restaurant review or a taxicab or the way you exchange value, is something they believe in and we want to be on top of it because I think it's going to impact you and I.""  ""I think there's something to it,"" he said, alluding to bitcoin and the blockchain. ""I think there's something here, that's why we invested in it.""
