12578094,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532409,1683928839,Dogecoin Expected To Experience A Further 6% Decrease Prior to Initiating Recovery,"In recent weeks, Dogecoin has faced a downward trend in its price momentum, largely due to the emergence of PEPE coin, which has overshadowed its popularity. Over the past 24 hours, DOGE has shown limited upward movement, with a mere 1% increase. The meme-coin has experienced a significant decline in price, indicating a prevailing bearish control. The technical outlook of Dogecoin showed that bears are currently influencing its price. Both the demand and accumulation have dipped, suggesting a decrease in buying activity. Related Reading: Key Support Levels To Monitor As Ethereum Price Slows Down Moreover, the rejection of Bitcoin at the $27,000 price mark has hurt major altcoins, including Dogecoin, resulting in a decline in their respective charts. For Dogecoin to maintain its position above its immediate support level, it needs a recovery in buying strength. If it fails to do so and loses its current support level, it could experience another significant drop in value before any signs of recovery. Additionally, the decline in the Dogecoin market capitalization further indicates a fading buying strength at the time of writing. Dogecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of the time of writing, Dogecoin (DOGE) was trading at $0.070. The meme-coin has been struggling to recover after facing rejection at $0.076, with the bulls unable to gain momentum. The current overhead resistance for DOGE is $0.073. If this level is breached, it could propel the meme-coin to $0.078. However, if the price falls from its current level, it will likely reach $0.068 and potentially drop further to $0.066, resulting in a nearly 6% decline in value. The trading volume of DOGE in the last session indicated a red signal, indicating mounting selling pressure. Technical Analysis Throughout the majority of the month, the demand for the meme-coin remained low. This was evident from the Relative Strength Index (RSI) staying below the 40-mark and nearly reaching the 30-mark, indicating oversold conditions. Additionally, the asset’s price consistently traded below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, suggesting that sellers were the driving force behind the market’s price momentum. Throughout this month, DOGE has lacked positive demand, and its chart displays sell signals. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which indicates price momentum and reversals, formed red histograms below the half-line. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunges Below $27,000, Which Holder Groups Are Selling? This suggests a signal to sell, indicating a potential decline in price in the upcoming trading sessions. The Bollinger Bands indicator has widened regarding price volatility and fluctuation, indicating that DOGE may experience price fluctuations in the next trading session. For Dogecoin to recover shortly, it heavily relies on broader market strength.

42393549,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bizT7B,1683926572,"As Bitcoin Scales, We Need Better Custodial Solutions","Crypto unintelligentsia discourse has been set aflame by this week’s Big Crisis in Bitcoin.  The culprit: big, fat, unwieldy fee rates.  George Kaloudis is a senior researcher and host of CoinDesk TV's ""All About Bitcoin.""     Until recently you could have sent a bitcoin transaction rather cheaply, probably at a fee rate of 1 satoshi per vByte (equivalent to a fraction of a cent). Now, with the rise of the use of non-fungible token-like “inscriptions” and the BRC-20 token standard on Bitcoin, normal fee rates are comparatively absurd. At time of writing, getting a bitcoin transaction sent in a reasonable time period would cost something like 100 satoshis per vByte.  All things considered, it’s actually still pretty cheap – but it’s way more expensive than bitcoiners are used to. And so, people are upset. The thing is, they are upset not because fee rates are high, but because of why fee rates are high.  See, the Bitcoin blockchain has always had scarce blockspace. “When billions and billions of people want to use bitcoin will it become too expensive to use?” has always been an open question about Bitcoin. It was even a central point of contention during the Blocksize Wars in 2015 to 2017 which led to the introduction of Segregated Witness (SegWit) to Bitcoin and the Bitcoin Cash hard fork.  (Of note: SegWit solved for transaction malleability and opened the door to our most recent reason for fees going up; funny how that works).  This time around, bitcoin fees have skyrocketed because a lot more people want to use bitcoin. And not to send permissionless, sound money to others or because they want to store wealth, but instead to put monkey pictures on the Bitcoin blockchain and speculate on tokens.  Blasphemous. Bitcoin should be used for financial transactions, hence the hullabaloo.  Putting aside the moralistic argument of what Bitcoin should be used for, bitcoiners have never really had a good response to how the network should handle periods of time when transaction fees spike. Canned answers that “people will just pay for the blockspace” or “the free market will figure it out” are setting up a world where the only people who are able to afford to transact on the network are the Bitcoin Rich.  Yuck. So much for unseating the rent-seekers.  Of course, high bitcoin fees have some potential solutions. The most commonly cited solution is Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, which has been pinpointed as a serviceable means to send bitcoin quickly and cheaply. When you’re already on-boarded and using the Lightning Network (and you know what you’re doing), it’s absolutely great. Transactions feel magic. They’re fast and cheap (when they don’t fail).  But the problem is you can’t get to layer 2 without sending initial transactions on layer 1, in this case the currently comparatively expensive Bitcoin blockchain. It’s just like you can’t get to the second story of most buildings without first stepping into the first story. In both cases, you can just wait until fees go down or until the elevator banks free up (or take the stairs, I guess?). But what if fees don’t go down? What if people keep piling into the building you’re in?  One way to solve this could be through third-party custody. That’s like your friend setting up a zipline from another building to the second floor through a window they opened for you so that you can get to the second floor without ever touching the first floor.  See also: SEC Blasted on Custody Proposal by JPMorgan, Crypto Industry  All you need is a little trust. Of course, this is exactly what bitcoin was created to avoid – as a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that can be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. But it's true, custodial solutions might actually be the easiest way to use the Lightning Network.  Doesn't it feel dirty though?  Unfortunately, the current design of Bitcoin probably doesn't allow for the entirety of the world to efficiently onboard through layer 1. Maybe the big philosophical discussion around being financially self-sovereign ends for most because it really is difficult to be fully self-sovereign, even with bitcoin.  Our future conversations around bitcoin should then probably focus on one thing: trade-offs.  Maybe it's fine that I use my bitcoin in a custodial way because it's easier for me, and you use it non-custodially. Fine. Maybe I’m wrong and you’re right. Maybe it's none of your business how I use my own (or, rather, my custodian’s) money.  The point is: we should be more open to discussing custodial solutions to our problems no matter how dirty it might make us feel. And to that end, applying some custodial products in your financial or bitcoin life need not bar you from using non-custodial products.  You can use both. We just deserve more clarity and options when it comes to these particular trade-offs.",NEGATIVE,없음,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | FORKS,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/05/12/as-bitcoin-scales-we-need-better-custodial-solutions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0fba12b5495976aa8c592d4ed15a2916374a0148-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

For three consecutive days, ATOM bulls have managed to bounce back and maintain the native token’s price, despite Bitcoin’s bearish momentum that has caused most altcoins to plummet. Cosmos’ (ATOM) renewed strength and price stamina in the crypto markets may be linked to the fresh updates announced by the team behind the project.

The Cosmos Replicated security model, a new and secure innovation, provides security to smart contracts and consumer chain platforms. The team announced and introduced Neutron as the first ever consumer chain and smart contracts platform to adopt and leverage its new and innovative Replicated security model. In leveraging Cosmos’ Replicated security model, smart contracts and consumer chains platforms like Neutron no longer worry about platform security but can now focus on other application areas and services, according to the official announcement. As seen in an official tweet where the team made the announcement, it was also stated that the Replicated security model brings forth a new dawn and era of utility as dApps can now launch with ATOM’s native security. This fundamental news by the Cosmos team could be the backing behind ATOM’s recent show of strength and price resilience despite the bearish market outlook observed in several cryptocurrencies.

The market capitalization of ATOM is also seen to increase by 1.10%. On the daily timeframe, bulls pushed ATOM’s price above the key resistance at $10.90 and moved further to an $11.27 high before retracing. The previous resistance turned support level on the daily price chart is a good area for bulls to build momentum and push ATOM’s price to the upside. Although the 50 and 200 Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) are an immediate resistance level, bulls must contend with them to confirm further upside movements.

The so-called major questions doctrine – a point of U.S. administrative law that suggests federal agencies shouldn’t step in front of Congress to engage on points of major economic significance – has been cited by Coinbase (COIN) in its preemptive defense of a pending SEC action, and Santori thinks it’s especially relevant as lawmakers start work on crypto oversight.  “The fact that Congress is taking this up, and you have representatives on both sides of the aisle – two committees having a historic joint hearing on it – these are all indicators that there is in fact a major question,” Santori said in an interview. “A court might look at what Congress is doing and say that the agency is getting ahead of its mandate from Congress, that this is a major question that ought to be decided by Congress.”  The top lawyer for Kraken, which itself had settled a major recent SEC accusation that its U.S. staking services amounted to an offering of unregistered securities, said the SEC and its sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), will have to bear in mind that doctrine, based in U.S. Supreme Court rulings.  “The agencies have to decide for themselves whether this is a major question,” said Santori, who was among the witnesses at this week’s joint hearing of the House Financial Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee.

The proposal, a successor to a version spearheaded by Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) last year, comes weeks after Waters said lawmakers need to start from scratch on legislation addressing this corner of the crypto market.  Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee had moved ahead on a new draft of a stablecoin bill in recent weeks, but it was greeted with frustration by the panel's Democrats, including Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the committee's senior Democrat. She'd publicly complained that the effort was done without Democratic involvement and that the lawmakers should be starting over.  A bill to address stablecoins -- tokens tied to steady assets such as the dollar that are widely used in crypto markets for trading in and out of more volatile coins -- has been a top priority of U.S. lawmakers seeking to get a handle on crypto oversight. The House committee's leaders had neared a compromise version last year, but they didn't manage to introduce it. It finally saw the light of day ahead of a hearing on the issue last month.  It's that document that the committee’s leaders are now pulling in different directions.  When Republicans on the committee released a discussion draft that included some of their most recent ideas, it gave strong authority to the states to continue regulating stablecoin issuers. But the Democrats’ version would give the Federal Reserve up-front veto power over the registration of those issuers – a point that’s sure to be contentious in the ongoing debate.  According to the person familiar, the new Democrat version of the bill has a greater focus on consumer protection issues and would not allow non-bank stablecoin issuers to tap Federal Reserve programs.  Both efforts share common ground in defining “payment stablecoins” as a specific classification of the digital asset type. The Democrat proposal also continues to call for a moratorium on algorithmic stablecoins, a stipulation that the Republican counterpart dropped.  The committee is set to hold another hearing May 18 on stablecoins legislation, making four crypto hearings for the panel in a month.  Last year’s legislative effort was reportedly close to the finish line, though committee members had expressed frustration that McHenry and Waters weren’t taking their input.

A higher network congestion and transaction fees may hinder Bitcoin's growth and affect market sentiment. The presence of a double top pattern, a symmetrical broadening wedge, and strong resistance at $28,000 indicate bearish pressure on Bitcoin's price, reinforcing the potential for a further decline. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is currently undergoing a period of turbulence and uncertainty, characterized by a downward trend. This can be largely attributed to macroeconomic factors, including concerns surrounding the impending debt ceiling and an ongoing banking crisis . These factors are eroding investor confidence in risk assets and triggering a search for safer investment options. This article offers an assessment of Bitcoin's pricing, providing insight into its potential future trajectory. Current observations indicate that the price is retracting from a significant resistance level, suggesting that a further downtrend may be on the horizon. This article builds upon the previous discussion and delves deeper into the present condition of the Bitcoin market. As anticipated, the price has reached the projected $28,000 level but is now continuing its descent. Global Financial Crisis and the Cryptocurrency Market The cryptocurrency market is currently navigating a turbulent phase marked by a downward trend. This is largely precipitated by macroeconomic factors, such as apprehensions surrounding the imminent debt ceiling and a lingering banking crisis, both of which are eroding investor confidence in risk assets. Further compounding this is the global financial crisis, triggered by the collapse of major U.S. banks , which is reverberating through the global economy, causing a depletion of bank deposits and inciting investors to seek safer assets. Amidst this turmoil, Bitcoin prices have seen a sharp rebound from a previous low to a critical resistance level. However, this crisis has also introduced a palpable level of uncertainty into the cryptocurrency market, leading to mixed implications for Bitcoin's prices. On one hand, as traditional banking systems falter, Bitcoin is increasingly being perceived as a 'safe-haven' asset. This sentiment could spur an upswing in demand for Bitcoin, thereby escalating its price. Conversely, the prevailing market uncertainty and volatility have also rendered investors cautious of speculative assets like Bitcoin. This apprehension may prompt investors to mitigate risk by moving their assets into traditionally secure investments like gold or government bonds, potentially leading to a sell-off in the Bitcoin market and a subsequent drop in its price. It is noteworthy that amidst this uncertainty, any decline in Bitcoin's value could present a viable buying opportunity for long-term investors. Observing the current market data in the chart below, Bitcoin transactions per day have surged to all-time highs, a trend with significant implications for its price. This heightened transaction volume often indicates increased market interest and activity, which could potentially boost Bitcoin's demand in the long run. If this augmented demand isn't matched with a corresponding supply increase, it could apply further upward pressure on Bitcoin's price. Moreover, the increase in transactions signifies wider adoption of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, potentially enhancing its intrinsic value and contributing to price appreciation. Data by YCharts However, it is crucial to recognize that an increase in transactions invariably leads to higher network congestion and transaction fees, which can negatively affect market sentiment. As seen in the chart below, Bitcoin's average transaction fees are on an upward trajectory. These higher transaction costs can deter users from conducting transactions or dissuade new investors from entering the market, especially if the costs are deemed prohibitively high. This potentially curbs the demand for Bitcoin, and consequently, applies downward pressure on its price. Therefore, while higher transaction fees may indicate heightened network activity, they yield both positive and negative implications for Bitcoin's price, contingent upon the market participants' response. Data by YCharts Bitcoin's Consolidation Phase and Potential for Further Decline Reflecting on the previous discussions about Bitcoin, a significant rebound from the support level of $17,000 has been observed, peaking at a notable resistance point of $28,000. This resistance, along with its corresponding support, deviates significantly from actual figures due to the considerable market volatility that characterizes Bitcoin. Drawing from previous discussions, a distinct double-top pattern has been identified at all-time highs. This pattern could potentially establish substantial barriers around the $28,000 region. Presently, Bitcoin is experiencing a correction from its recent high of $31,000. For a clearer understanding of the current price levels, attention can be drawn to the chart below. This illustrates the formation of a symmetrical broadening wedge that originates from the recent bottom. This pattern signifies a period of market uncertainty and indecision. It also indicates that the price of Bitcoin is currently in a phase of consolidation, which is progressively narrowing. The base patterns for this consolidation can be traced back to the double top pattern, where the price broke the neckline around $29,000 and subsequently retraced lower. The emergence of this pattern, coupled with the symmetrical broadening wedge, suggests that there's potential for a further decline in the Bitcoin price. This prediction is further supported by the bearish response observed at the $28,000 resistance level. Bitcoin Weekly Chart (stockcharts.com) Given the substantial volatility of the Bitcoin market, employing a logarithmic chart provides a more precise representation of price movements by filtering out significant spikes. The chart below offers a weekly outlook for Bitcoin on a logarithmic scale, clearly outlining the significance of the current levels. It also draws attention to the underlying pattern formed between 2015 and 2021, where the price exhibited a parabolic trajectory. Particularly intriguing is the price decline in 2020 due to the Covid-19 crisis, which was counterbalanced by an equivalent upswing. Following these strong historical moves, the market has formed a double top at the resistance area, culminating in a successful break of the double top by breaching the neckline at $29,000. This shift signifies a bearish movement, placing the market under continued bearish pressure. Consequently, the recent recovery from $15,000 levels remains a recovery. A definitive bottom will not be confirmed until the $28,000 resistance is unequivocally breached. Furthermore, the RSI is currently in the overbought territory and continues to decline, reinforcing the potential for a significant correction in the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin Weekly Chart (stockcharts.com) Key Action for Investors To better facilitate investor action, the aforementioned discussion can be visualized more explicitly via Bitcoin's daily chart. Interestingly, the daily chart also exhibits the emergence of a symmetrical broadening wedge. This pattern suggests an escalation in market volatility and indecision, potentially linked to the ongoing financial crisis accelerated by the collapse of major US banks. This economic turmoil has also permeated the cryptocurrency market, prompting investors to explore alternative investment options. The chart accentuates the formation of a head and shoulders pattern at the right resistance area of the symmetrical broadening wedge. This pattern is critical for forecasting a bearish outlook as it emerges exactly at the symmetrical broadening wedge. The neckline of the head and shoulders pattern lies at the $27,000 level - a break below this level could potentially trigger a downward momentum. Drawing from the baseline pattern of the double top in 2021 and the considerable volatility leading to the formation of the symmetrical broadening wedge, it is anticipated that Bitcoin's decline is not yet complete and the price must decrease further before ascending again. Bitcoin Daily Chart (stockcharts.com) Risk Factors In spite of the current downturn and recent depreciation in cryptocurrency values, Bitcoin has historically shown an impressive capacity for recovery. The early part of the year was marked by a robust resurgence in the prices of cryptocurrencies, suggesting that they have the potential to bounce back from the prevailing market conditions. Additionally, the surge in transaction fees on the Bitcoin network is indicative of a high degree of market activity, often interpreted as a bullish sign. This implies sustained interest and robust participation in the Bitcoin market. Moreover, investor sentiment constitutes another significant risk factor in the Bitcoin market. Although the current trend sees investors gravitating towards traditional safe-haven assets like gold and commodities, shifts in sentiment can occur rapidly. Any positive developments in macroeconomic conditions, or a resolution to the ongoing banking crisis, could trigger a swift resurgence in investor confidence in cryptocurrencies, thereby propelling prices upwards. Furthermore, Bitcoin's recovery from the $15,000 mark was fueled by strong support in the market, and it is currently challenging a significant resistance area at $28,000. A breach of Bitcoin from this resistance zone will potentially initiate upward momentum, mitigating the currently bearish outlook. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is currently facing a turbulent phase characterized by a downward trend, influenced by macroeconomic factors and global financial instability. Bitcoin's price has shown a rebound amidst this turmoil, but the crisis has introduced uncertainty, leading to mixed implications for its future prices. The surge in Bitcoin transactions indicates increased market interest and potential for price appreciation, yet higher network congestion and transaction fees pose challenges and may impact Bitcoin's demand and price. Moreover, the presence of a double top pattern, a symmetrical broadening wedge, and strong resistance at $28,000 indicate bearish pressure on Bitcoin's price. The logarithmic chart reinforces this perspective, highlighting the significance of the current levels and further strengthening the bearish outlook. Furthermore, the RSI indicator in the overbought territory and the emergence of a head and shoulders pattern on the daily chart point towards a potential downward momentum. In conclusion, the Bitcoin price is expected to maintain its high volatility and persistently decline from the strong resistance level of $28,000. A crucial factor for confirming a bearish outlook is achieving another weekly close below $27,000, thereby breaking the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. Investors are advised to capitalize on any upward price rebounds by selling their positions in the market.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4603786-bitcoin-sell-the-market-technical-analysis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12575363.jpeg

Obtaining approval would require the crypto trading platform to pass the CSA’s various due diligence checks.  In its Friday tweet, Binance added that it did not agree with the new regulations but still hopes to work with Canadian regulators to further develop a regulatory framework around cryptocurrencies.  Over the past year, Binance has received increased scrutiny from North American regulators, and appears to be ramping down operations in the region.

Riot first disclosed its allegations in its first-quarter earnings report yesterday and according to a petition obtained by CoinDesk, Riot's participation in demand response programs, under which bitcoin miners get power credits to limit their energy consumption, is the key reason that led to the lawsuit. The civil case for breach of contract was filed by Riot with the district court of Milam County in Texas on May 2 and four of Rhodium's subsidiaries as defendants.  Riot claims that Rhodium ""deliberately miscalculated"" how much in hosting fees it had to pay for Riot's hosting services. The two were supposed to share the net revenue from Rhodium's mining at the Whinstone facilities, said the lawsuit, which further alleged that the Rhodium entities short-changed Whinstone for $26 million from 2021 to the first quarter of 2023.  Whinstone claims it tried to collect the payments in May 2022 and on April 5, but the Rhodium entities have refused or failed to pay, leading to the lawsuit.  Separately, Riot claims that Rhodium's units were amassing power credits on their books for two years that it didn't have rights to. Riot also wants the court to declare that Riot doesn't owe Rhodium any power credits. Riot claims that those power credits could have had a legal basis from previous contracts, but those were superseded by the December 2020 agreements.  In October 2022, the Rhodium entities asked Whinstone to ""verify"" that they were ""owed"" power credits that were unrelated to the expired contracts. Whinstone rejected the request and asked the court to declare it doesn't owe any such credits to Rhodium.  Riot confirmed the lawsuit but did not provide comment.

42393563,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bizUGz,1683920157,"Staking Platform Agility Soared After Ethereum’s Shapella Upgrade, but It’s Suffered Ever Since","When Ethereum recently completed an upgrade known as Shapella, it was heralded as opening a new era of staking ETH. Up until that point, if you staked ETH to help run the blockchain, you couldn’t get it back. Shapella made it possible to unstake, making it more attractive to pledge ETH in the first place.  A project called Agility LSD was an immediate beneficiary. The amount of money stashed in its protocol – as measured by total value locked (TVL) – soared to a peak of $487 million last month, up from zero when its contracts launched earlier in April, according to data from DefiLlama.  But, just as fast as the money poured in, it’s nearly all drained away. TVL has since plummeted 99% to just $6 million.  There are other signs the bottom has fallen out of Agility. Its stETH staking pool at its height had more than 141,000 stETH, worth $293 million, but that has dwindled to roughly 3,200 stETH tokens, worth about $5.7 million, per data from blockchain analytics firm Nansen.  Also, the price and trading volume of AGI, the native token for the protocol, have both slid more than 99%, according to CoinGecko data.  Agility’s Discord admin who goes by the screenname Nook-Stealth Cooking said the drop in TVL occurred “because we [stopped] rewarding farmers,” which was “a request from our community.” While Agility announced on May 10 that emissions for staking rewards would be paused as a result of a Twitter poll, its TVL, token price and trading volume were already declining before May 10.  Meme coins may be another reason for the decrease, according to Nook-Stealth Cooking, who said, “meme[s] gets most of the attention during this month, including liquidity.”  Meme coin Pepecoin (PEPE) did emerge out of nowhere in recent weeks, topping $1 billion in market cap. But Agility is suffering far more than its competitors in the staking space. The top 10 liquid staking protocols by TVL, according to DefiLlama, have seen their TVL drop on average by roughly 10% in the past seven days, a much smaller percentage change than Agility.  CoinGecko still has a warning on the AGI token page, saying “The smart-contract owner can mint new tokens, please proceed with caution.”",NEGATIVE,ETH | PEPE,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | PEPE,Sage D.

The incident – the cause of which remains a matter of speculation – sparked major security concerns for users of the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization. According to the Ethereum Foundation, when blocks are not being finalized, it is possible that pending transactions might be re-ordered or dropped from the network.  The network had resumed finalizing blocks at press time, but this is the second time Ethereum has seen a hit to its performance in 24 hours – the chain experienced the same issue Thursday, when finality paused for roughly 25 minutes.  Questions about Ethereum's stability could stain its credibility in the eyes of builders. Network reliability is important for blockchains looking to attract users and capital, and Ethereum has historically been viewed as among the most stable networks on the market.  ""I wouldn't say I am concerned but it's definitely not ideal,"" Toghrul Maharramov, a developer at the Ethereum infrastructure startup Scroll, wrote in a message to CoinDesk. ""To be able to say whether or not the situation is the fault of the protocol design or an outcome of a bug, we need to first understand what actually happened.""  Superphiz.eth, a self-proclaimed “Ethereum Beacon Chain community health consultant,” clarified on Twitter that transactions do not halt as a result of finality issues like those Ethereum experienced over the past couple of days. The lack of finality technically had “zero impact on-chain activity,” he tweeted after yesterday's hiccup.  Some of the services built atop Ethereum – which hosts a multi-billion-dollar network of financial infrastructure and other applications – may be forced to modify operations as a result of finality issues, however. DYdX, a leading crypto exchange platform, says it paused deposits temporarily today due to the lack of Ethereum finality and was “continuing to monitor and investigate this issue.”  ""The second wave is over, but I fully expect a third,"" Superphiz.eth tweeted after today's incident, advising the validators that operate the network to ""Increase your hardware spec if you can, switch to a minority client if you can. Apply patches when they're available.""  ""But really don't worry too much,"" he added. ""As bad as this looks, the chain keeps going and eventually finalizes.""

The goal is to create a strong governance equilibrium that enables the permissionless growth of SubDAOs and parallelized product development in an emergent, community-driven ecosystem. Related Reading: Is This The Perfect Time To Buy Bitcoin? TD Sequential And RSI Suggests So Revolutionizing DeFi According to the announcement, The short-term objective of Endgame is to grow MakerDAO into the largest and most widely used stablecoin project within 3 years. From there, the project aims to anchor its growth in an autonomous DAO economy that ensures its growth can accelerate and safely reach any scale level without putting the resilient governance equilibrium at risk. To achieve this goal, Endgame will be launched in five successive phases. The first phase, called Phase 0, will focus on improving the scalability and efficiency of the Maker Protocol. This will involve upgrading the system’s architecture and deploying AI tools to optimize various processes. Phase 1 will introduce the SubDAO framework, enabling the creation of specialized DAOs that can operate independently or in conjunction with the MakerDAO governance structure. This will allow for parallelized product development and the emergence of a community-driven ecosystem. The SubDAOs are further divided into Facilitator & Allocator DAOs, and their genesis tokens will be distributed through the NewStable farms. This will be supported by the Smart Burn Engine, which will accumulate and burn LP tokens for NewStable against NewGovToken using protocol surplus. Phase 2 will focus on enhancing the governance mechanism of MakerDAO to ensure that it remains resilient and adaptable as the project grows. This will involve the development of a comprehensive governance framework that incorporates the SubDAOs and ensures that they are aligned with the project’s overall goals. Phase 3 will introduce new collateral types to the Maker Protocol, expanding its use case and increasing its adoption. This will include integrating real-world assets, such as real estate and stocks, as collateral, providing new opportunities for investors and borrowers. Finally, Phase 4 will focus on the project’s long-term sustainability by introducing a decentralized treasury and investment strategy that will ensure the long-term growth and stability of the MakerDAO ecosystem. MakerDAO Biggest Upgrade Yet According to the analysis by the DeFi researcher under the pseudonym “DeFi Ignas,” To further streamline governance, MakerDAO is also introducing an AI Tools system to enable users to verify governance rules and processes or generate new governance proposals. The Sagittarius Lockstake Engine (SLE) will incentivize NewGovToken holders to participate in governance by locking their tokens and delegating their voting power to receive rewards as NewStable income or SubDAO tokens. Governance participation is gamified for accessibility, which creates earning opportunities. Furthermore, To encourage participation in governance during challenging times, MakerDAO is imposing a 15% exit fee on locked tokens. Bootstrapping rewards will also be offered to join governance. Per DeFi Ignas Analysis, the native token for gas fees will be Savings-NewStable, a tokenized version of NewStable actively earning the Savings Rate. Consensus staking will be with NewGovToken through the Sagittarius Lockstake Engine. Overall, This latest upgrade announcement from MakerDAO represents a major step forward for the DeFi ecosystem. By reducing governance complexity and increasing efficiency, MakerDAO is positioning itself to become the world’s largest and most widely used stablecoin project while maintaining its resilience and adaptability in the face of rapidly changing market conditions and potential regulatory risks. According to DeFi Ignas, the ultimate aim is to create an Unbiased World Currency that is not necessarily pegged to the USD.

42393547,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bizT23,1683917278,"MakerDAO Founder Proposes Plan for Upgraded Versions of DAI Stablecoin, Governance Token","Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform MakerDAO’s founder, Rune Christensen, laid out plans to introduce a new stablecoin and governance token as part of the platform’s on-going revamp, according to a proposal posted on Maker’s governance forum on Thursday.  The tokens will be upgraded versions of Maker’s stablecoin DAI and its governance token maker (MKR), and are expected to arrive “within several months” together with a new, unified brand and website for the protocol, the proposal said.  Christensen also proposed to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) into Maker’s governance processes.  The proposal is part of Maker’s major restructuring called the “Endgame” that aims to revitalize the platform and boost development of applications for the protocol’s stablecoin. Maker’s governance has been embroiled in drama on several occasions, leaving community members divided, while demand for its DAI stablecoin has been steadily declining, dropping to $4.7 billion tokens in circulation from almost $10 billion in little over a year.  The initiative, which was approved in October by the community, includes breaking up Maker’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure into smaller SubDAOs, which are self-governing and self-sustaining entities with their own tokens within the MakerDAO ecosystem. CoinDesk reported in March that Christensen said in a community call that DAI suffered from bad branding that could inhibit its growth.  Christensen wrote in the proposal that the new stablecoin and governance token are the first phase of a five-stage roadmap to implement the Endgame.  The new stablecoin will be a wrapped version of DAI, and Maker will establish incentives for protocols that integrate the token.  The new governance token will have a larger supply than MKR, with a 1200:1 exchange rate to MKR. It will also give access to Maker’s AI-assisted governance tools, allowing token holders to “easily summarize and verify governance rules and processes, or generate new aligned governance proposals,” the proposal said.  Maker’s current tokens, DAI and MKR, will continue to exist without any changes, and users will be able to upgrade their holdings for the new assets without any fees and limitations.  Both new tokens will offer yield farming opportunities for holders to earn rewards. However, investors based in the U.S. and VPN users will be geoblocked from accessing farming.  “The short-term objective of Endgame is to grow to the largest and most widely used stablecoin project within three years,” Christensen wrote.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency traded at around $26,300 at press time, a level not seen since March 17. Bitcoin’s high for the week came on Wednesday morning when it rose to $28,300 following softer than expected CPI data on Wednesday.  “Bitcoin might break below $26,000 over the weekend but it’s well bid right now,” said Laurent Kssis, crypto advisor at CEC Capital. “Clearly there are no fundamentals holding BTC up any longer and traders are concerned but it feels a short term play to increase BTC holdings at these lower levels,” he added.

Ether (ETH) was also lower for the week, though it did outperform bitcoin by a bit. It’s currently at $1,770 versus its weekly high of $2,020 touched last Saturday.  Helping to sour the mood in bitcoin were tumbling prices for some memecoins, notably pepecoin (PEPE), which is now lower by more than 60% over the past week of trade. The new token based on “pepe the frog” debuted on April and quickly rose to more than a $1 billion valuation. That’s now been trimmed to roughly $560 million.  Other memecoin decliners included dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), each of which lost about 11% over the last 7days.  ""The hype of meme coins is usually exciting, but often followed by a market crash, similar to what we saw with DOGE and SHIB two years ago,” said Youwei Yang, chief economist at publicly traded bitcoin mining company, BTCM. “The market correction for memecoins this week is largely due to the calm down of the FOMO (fear of missing out) sentiment with these new memecoins.”  Altcoins were not spared in the selloff, with Aptos’ (APT), shedding 20%, and Filecoin (FIL) and Aribitrum’s (ARB) each off about 17%.",NEGATIVE,BTC | DOGE | SHIB | APT,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | APT,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/12/bitcoin-loses-10-on-the-week-as-memecoins-tumble,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/295c868814fc66c9715293500410e6007f45de3c-5726x3221.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393558,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bizTbx,1683916200,"Frogs, Fevers and Fees: Bitcoin’s New Governance Challenge","This is why we can’t have nice things.  Just when we thought we'd learned our lessons from the blowups of FTX, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius et al., meme-coin fever strikes again.  Crazy crypto casinos are back! People are making ridiculous gobs of money from tokens based on a frog image, while others stand to lose massively as irrational bidding takes hold. And this time, the fever is not only infecting greedy human minds, but messing with the functioning of the most valuable blockchain in the world.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The ability to create tokens based on the new BRC-20 standard, which was enabled by Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade, has fostered a variety of new, Bitcoin-based meme-coins, many mimicking those released on other chains that have recently experienced wild price movements. (This past week, the Ethereum-based Pepecoin rose almost 5,000,000%, then lost 50% off its highs.) This follows the creation of the Ordinals Protocol, which gave rise to Bitcoin-based data inscriptions that function as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  These use up a lot more data than a basic bitcoin transaction, which means they’re driving up Bitcoin fees. Bitcoin miners have lately been earning more from transaction fees than from their routine 6.25 bitcoin block reward. And that means if you want to send a small amount of bitcoin on-chain, it won’t be accepted or you’ll have to pay a prohibitively exorbitant price for doing so.  I can hear Elizabeth Warren’s “anti-crypto army” sniggering: ""These crypto bros are so obsessed with mooning into lambos that they’re destroying what they claim to be this technology’s core purpose as a better form of money and value exchange.”  The fighting begins  Not surprisingly, this is causing a stink within the Bitcoin community. The fight over the scarce resource of blockspace has long stirred tensions – most memorably during the Block Size wars of 2016-2017 (a piece of crypto history to be featured in CoinDesk’s 10-year anniversary coverage). It motivated the founding of the Lightning Network, which allows for small transactions to be processed off-chain to save valuable blockspace for bigger ones.  The potential for tension is arguably even greater in this case. Purists who believe Bitcoin’s sole purpose is as an alternative currency are incensed to see it being used for frivolous frog JPGs. On the other hand, those building and using these new BRC-20 and Ordinals-based tokens counter that no one gets to say what Bitcoin is for. It’s an open protocol, after all.  We can all agree that rising transaction fees and blockchain congestion are a problem. It goes to the heart of Bitcoin’s resource efficiency and utility. But what can be done about it?  I’ll go out on a limb and say the answer does not lie in the suggestion offered by Luke Dashjr, a high-profile early Bitcoin developer, who essentially wants to stop BRC token and Ordinals projects by imposing a filter. That, Dashjr’s critics say, is censorship. No matter what you believe Bitcoin is for, surely its censorship-resistance must be preserved.  Echoing Bitcoin Policy Institute fellow Troy Cross’s view on taxation and energy policy – on our podcast this week he said the White House proposal to tax bitcoin mining discriminated one person’s energy choice over another’s – I’d say Bitcoin’s community cannot constrain what forms of value exchange Bitcoin’s blockchain is used for.  Limits on speculation?  What is fair game – in my humble opinion – are code upgrades that would take pressure off blockspace limits to improve the overall functioning of the system in a use case-agnostic way.  If Lightning is not sufficient to improve Bitcoin’s scalability, is there anything to learn from the various Layer 2 scaling projects of the Ethereum community, such as Zk-rollups or Optimistic rollups?  Or, might it be possible, or even appropriate, for the protocol to bake in time-lock constraints or costs on certain speculative activities that challenge the liquidity of the entire system? I’m specifically thinking of short-term asset flipping. (Note: this could only be relevant to non-fungible tokens. You can’t impose a limit on fungible BRC-20 tokens, precisely because the owner can just sell a different one. Money can’t be constrained in this way.)  Read more: Among Bitcoin Developers, Debate Is Raging Over Whether to Censor Ordinals BRC-20s  Folks way smarter than I will, I’m sure, point out flaws in these suggestions. Indeed, if someone were to say that in singling out asset flipping – which, after all, brings liquidity to the market –  I’m no different from Luke Dashjr railing against meme-coins, they’d have a point. I’m judging one person’s activity over another’s.  Still, the core problem here is not that Bitcoin is being used to represent frog images per se, but that its value as an efficient, intermediary-free settlement system for transferring value of all kinds is undermined by blockspace congestion. (As CoinDesk columnist David Z. Morris wrote this week, Bitcoin would be experiencing the same problems if, as its advocates hope, millions more people were using Bitcoin for monetary purposes.) That’s where the governance conversation needs to be focused.  The question of how to balance the rights of the individual with the interests of the group is the core challenge of any blockchain community.

12573176,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532354,1683914857,"Bitcoin Plunges Below $27,000, Which Holder Groups Are Selling?","Bitcoin has plunged below the $27,000 mark during the past day. Here are the market segments that are possibly participating in this selloff. These Bitcoin Investors Have Been Spending Their Coins Recently In a new tweet, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has broken down the prices at which the average coins sold today were bought. Generally, the BTC market is divided into two main segments: the long-term holders (LTHs) and the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs comprise a cohort including all investors who acquired their Bitcoin within the last 155 days. The LTHs, on the other hand, are investors who have been holding for more than this threshold amount. In the context of the current discussion, the relevant indicator is the “dormancy average spending ranges,” which finds out the periods in which the average coins being spent/transferred by these two groups were first acquired. For example, if the metric shows the 7-day spending range for the LTHs as $20,000 to $30,000, it means that the coins these investors sold in the past week were initially bought at prices in this range. Related Reading: Is Pepe Coin Ready For Another Pump? Here’s What On-Chain Data Says Here is a chart showing the data for the current 7-day dormancy average spending ranges for the STHs and LTHs, as well for the combined market. The different average spending ranges of the main segments of the sector | Source: Glassnode on Twitter The graph shows that the 7-day average spending range for the STHs is quite close to the current prices at $30,400 to $27,300. Some of these sellers bought at higher prices than those observed in the past week, so they must have been selling at a loss (although not a particularly deep one). The indicator puts the LTHs’ acquisition range at $67,600 to $35,000. As highlighted in the chart, the timeframe of these purchases included the lead-up to the November 2021 price all-time high, the top itself, and the period when the decline towards the bear market first started. It would appear that these holders who bought at the high bull market prices have budged because of the pressure the cryptocurrency has been under lately and have finally decided to take their losses and move on. Generally, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell at any point. This would perhaps explain why the acquisition timeframe of the current STHs is so recent; the fickle ones are those who have only been holding a short while. For the BTC LTHs, however, the probable reason why the acquisition period of the average seller from this group is so far back, rather than nearer to 155 days ago (the cutoff of the youngest LTHs), is that a lot of the younger LTHs would be in profits currently as they bought during the lower, bear-market prices. Related Reading: Does The Bitcoin Price Dump Signal The Start Of Another Bear Market? As such, the Bitcoin investors more likely to waver in their conviction right now would be those holding the most severe losses, the 2021 bull run top buyers. The chart also includes the 7-day average spending range for the combined BTC sector, and as one may expect, this range lies in the middle of the two cohorts ($15,800 to $28,500), but the timeframe is closer to the STHs, as a lot of the sellers are bound to be recent buyers.

42393559,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bizTrL,1683912464,Sam Bankman-Fried's Ties to George Santos Are Just the Beginning,"This week saw the charging and arrest of George Santos, the comically inventive Long Island Congressman. Almost unbelievably, Santos is connected to another apparently inveterate liar: Sam Bankman-Fried, the multiply-indicted founder and former CEO of collapsed crypto exchange FTX. Bankman-Fried’s ties to Santos were just a footnote to Bankman-Freid’s sprawling political influence campaign, seemingly funded in large part with stolen customer funds.  The goal of that campaign, however clumsily pursued, may have been the passage of a piece of cryptocurrency legislation, the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act, or DCCPA. Many have argued that the DCCPA would have benefitted FTX at the expense of the broader crypto ecosystem – and maybe even allowed Bankman-Fried to keep his gargantuan embezzlement scheme going.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  To catch a pretender  George Santos seems to have told an array of lies about his biography and resume, including that he’s Jewish, a former Broadway producer and both the survivor of an assassination attempt and the son of a 9/11 survivor. The lies are almost as entertaining as they are infuriating, suggesting not so much strategic deception as some form of mental illness.  But this week's charges against Santos are serious, and a little sad: he faces 13 criminal counts including money laundering and wire fraud. This includes allegedly embezzling $50,000 in campaign funds to buy himself fancy clothes.  According to public records uncovered in December of 2022, Santos’ donors included three figures from the FTX circle. The Santos campaign reportedly received the maximum possible individual donation from FTX senior exec Clare Watanabe, product head Ramnik Arora and Ryan Salame, CEO of the company's Bahamian subsidiary FTX Digital Markets, who gave upwards of $24 million to Republican candidates and committees during the midterms.  This information was puzzling when it first emerged – Santos had no clear connection to FTX, and no apparent interest in crypto or any other issues Bankman-Fried feigned concern about. According to Puck News, though, the explanation for the Santos connection is relatively straightforward. Salame’s girlfriend, Michelle Bond, former CEO of the FTX-backed crypto trade group Association for Digital Asset Markets, ran for Congress in 2022 as a MAGA Republican, in a district near Santos’.  The FTX executive donations went to Santos as part of an agreement with Bond to “swap” donors who had hit the individual limit for donations to the partner candidate. In other words, FTX execs gave money to Santos not because they supported him, but as part of supporting Bond. Puck characterizes such swaps as fairly routine in political campaigns. But Salame was deeply entwined with other aspects of the FTX hustle. Though he has not yet been charged with any crime, the $4 million home he shares with Bond was raided by the FBI in late April.  Effective egotism  While not seemingly criminal in its own right, the arcane connection between FTX and George Santos reflects the sprawling nature of Sam Bankman-Fried’s larger political influence campaign in 2021 and 2022. In the months since FTX’s collapse and Bankman-Fried’s arrest, it has become clear that these political efforts were as corrupt as every other aspect of his dealings.  The mountain of criminal charges against Bankman-Fried include violating campaign finance laws by allegedly funneling (allegedly stolen) corporate funds through so-called “straw donors,” including Salame and FTX co-founder Nishad Singh, to circumvent the law. The straw donor scheme seems to have been intended mainly to disguise the fact that, while positioning himself as the next Democratic mega-donor, Bankman-Fried was in fact funneling donations to both Republicans and Democrats.  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried Hit With Additional Bank Fraud Charges  But this is just the beginning of an apparently even more sprawling and frankly very weird set of relationships among a huge cast of political hustlers.  In one striking example, a source told Puck that they received a donation from Nishad Singh even though they had cultivated a relationship with Mind the Gap, a pre-FTX fundraising organization spearheaded by Sam Bankman-Fried’s mother, Barbara Fried. This suggests Mind the Gap may have helped identify candidates who then received donations of stolen FTX customer funds.  Another seemingly major nexus of the FTX influence-peddling effort was Democratic strategist and fundraiser Sean McElwee, who reportedly helped guide donations for Bankman-Fried. It was also recently revealed that McElwee had gambled on political contests, including betting against candidates he was working for. Though McElwee hasn’t faced any legal fallout, those two dings reportedly led to his December 2022 firing as head of Data for Progress, an extremely influential left-leaning think tank and polling firm he founded in 2018.  The long game  These are just a few highlights of a truly Byzantine operation. But what was Sam Bankman-Fried hoping to gain by spreading so much money around, by such deceptive means?  Publicly, Bankman-Fried used his political donations to buttress his carefully-crafted (and admittedly fake) image as a concerned philanthropist. For instance, another seeming middleman for FTX funds was Sam’s younger brother Gabe Bankman-Fried, who was placed in charge of a political advocacy nonprofit called Guarding Against Pandemics (GAP). The organization’s main source of funding was FTX.  Many in the industry were hostile to the DCCPA legislation that Bankman-Fried helped craft.  GAP’s political efforts appear to have been thoroughly hamfisted and ineffectual. Guarding Against Pandemics spent unprecedented sums in an Oregon House race, but its candidate lost. GAP also intervened in a Colorado ballot initiative and managed to alienate parties it was nominally collaborating with. Michelle Bond, meanwhile, lost her House primary race by an embarrassing 20 points. The combined ineptitude and corruption on display is a revealing parallel to Alameda Research’s ability to lose massive amounts of money despite seemingly having a cheat code on FTX.  But even if you’re incompetent, throwing tens of millions of dollars around clearly counts for a lot in Washington, D.C. Bankman-Fried’s donations likely helped him win meetings with the likes of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, and invitations to testify before Congress about crypto. Gensler and others seemed eager to welcome Bankman-Fried as an “adult in the room” on crypto regulation.  See also: FTX Asks Politicians Who Received Donations From Sam Bankman-Fried to Return Funds  But many in the industry were hostile to the DCCPA legislation that Bankman-Fried helped craft, and which would have imposed onerous and even nonsensical requirements on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and services. Many argued that the rules would have amounted to a ban on DeFi in the U.S., and would have channeled more crypto into centralized entities – including FTX itself. That might have saved FTX from collapse and helped keep Bankman-Fried’s many alleged crimes secret.  As we move closer to Bankman-Fried’s scheduled October criminal trial, the theft of customer funds will be a dominant issue for many crypto industry observers. But that’s just one part of an even darker allegation: that Bankman-Fried, with help from many allies, used those stolen funds to pervert the legislative process of the United States towards his own entirely self-interested goals.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,David Z.

TD Sequential And RSI Suggests So,"Bitcoin (BTC) investors have been closely monitoring the cryptocurrency market in recent days due to Bitcoin’s significant drop in price. The market’s largest cryptocurrency has shown a downtrend in its price action and has lost its key support level at $27,200, which was previously noted by the 50-day moving average (MA). Despite the bearish trend, trader and analyst Ali suggests that there may be some hope for bulls. Though the market is currently in a state of decline, Ali believes that there is still a chance for BTC to experience a reversal shortly. Related Reading: Is Pepe Coin Ready For Another Pump? Here’s What On-Chain Data Says Buy The Bitcoin Dip? Ali points to the TD Sequential indicator on the Bitcoin 4-hour chart, which has shown a buy signal. In addition, a bullish divergence is developing on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), indicating a potential reversal shortly. Bitcoin has been experiencing a period of volatility, with the cryptocurrency facing a strong resistance level at $28,000 in the past few days, following the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rates by the Federal Reserve (Fed). Although trader and analyst Ali believes that if Bitcoin can hold above the $26,000 support level, there could be an upswing to either $26,860 or $27,570. On the other hand, Ali suggests that if Bitcoin fails to hold above the $26,000 level, it could trigger a further drop to $25,200. However, there is some good news for Bitcoin bulls, as the 200-day moving average (MA) is currently placed at $24,700. This level could potentially act as a crucial threshold for BTC, serving as a bottom line for the cryptocurrency in the short term. Bitcoin And Crypto Market Vulnerable To Short Squeeze? According to the latest report by the Singapore-based digital asset trading firm, QCP Capital, this week’s sell-off has caused Bitcoin to fall through the head and shoulders trendline, but a close below $26,500 is still preventing a larger breakdown. Additionally, Bitcoin has a negative divergence on momentum indicators, leading QCP Capital to be biased towards a near-term break lower, potentially to the $25,000 mark and then to the $20,000-$22,000 level. Despite this, QCP Capital views the lower level of $20,000-$22,000 as a high-conviction medium-term buy zone. The firm has even sold physically settled puts at this level before, indicating its confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term prospects. Related Reading: Key Support Levels To Monitor As Ethereum Price Slows Down Furthermore, according to Chart 3 in the report, as seen below, an increase in volatility has historically led to a strengthening of the USD and a weakening of risk assets such as BTC. The report notes that while the outcome of the current political drama in Washington is uncertain, the market’s response in terms of implied volatility across assets will be key in determining the next trend direction. The report also suggests that a sharp increase in volatility could lead to a move lower for BTC and other risk assets. This could be a concern for investors who have seen BTC reach new annual highs in 2023. However, volatility can create opportunities for traders who can navigate the market’s ups and downs. As of this writing, the largest cryptocurrency in the market, BTC, is currently trading at $26,300, down by 2.1% in the last 24 hours.

Chorlian, who co-founded the company alongside Nejc Krajnik in 2021, said that the decision was made after ""carefully analyzing possible market scenarios, our company structure and our financial situation.""  Curated digital fine art marketplace Escher, one of the projects in the Tessera portfolio, will also be shutting down, Chorlian tweeted.  ""As we really dug into the economic model for Escher, we saw that the targets we needed to hit to attain profitability – compared to the time and resource costs to scale there – just didn’t add up or make good business sense,"" he wrote.  Other Tessera projects include Nounlets, a fractional ownership platform for Nouns NFTs, and We Do a Little, a podcast hosted by Chorlian and NFT influencer Deeze.  The news of Tessera's shutdown comes just under a year after it rebranded from its original name Fractional and announced a $20 million funding round led by crypto investment giant Paradigm.

Fractional NFTs Explained  Fractionalizing NFTs involves creating fungible tokens tied to an underlying digital asset, like a Bored Ape or CryptoPunk. The NFT is often locked away in a vault, and fractional tokens can be traded on secondary marketplaces.  As the NFT market continues to struggle through an extended crypto winter, marketplaces have embraced ways to allow users to invest in digital collectibles with smaller upfront costs. Earlier this month, popular NFT marketplace Blur launched a peer-to-peer lending network called Blend, which allows traders to put up a percentage of the NFT's price upfront and finance the remaining balance. NFTX, another fractionalizing platform, allows traders to pool NFTs of equal value into index funds and mint fungible ERC-20 tokens tied to underlying NFTs (ERC-721 tokens), creating increased liquidity.

Meanwhile, Miladys, the eerie, wide-eyed NFT project that has spawned a cult following, saw a brief spike in its floor price after Elon Musk tweeted out a meme featuring an avatar from the collection.  Plus, digital asset custodian Aegis Custody is offering free custodial services to women for six months, worth a total of $28,000, in order to make it easier for women to join Web3.

The platform already offers support for NFTs built on Ethereum, Polygon and its native BNB Chain. To simplify the process, Binance will allow traders to buy Ordinals through their Binance accounts without having to set up a taproot-compatible Bitcoin wallet.  Bitcoin NFTs are going mainstream: Popular NFT marketplace Magic Eden recently expanded support for Bitcoin NFTs, while platform Gamma.io has made minting and buying Ordinals easier. Yuga Labs recently released its own Bitcoin NFT collection called TwelveFold, which generated $16.5 million from its auction.  A Milady from the Dogefather: Twitter CEO Elon Musk tweeted a meme featuring a Milady NFT, causing the floor price of the wide-eyed avatars to soar on OpenSea. The project, which has seen a resurgence amongst the NFT community for several weeks, saw its floor price briefly hit an all-time high of 7.3 ETH (approximately $13,700) before dipping back down to about 4.25 ETH as of writing.  Pumping power: Historically, when Musk tweets about a crypto project, that project sees a temporary spike in value.

Its trading volume is down by over 15%, but its price has entered a consolidation phase. ADA is trading above its 7-day low of $0.3512, implying that a return to the 7-day high of $0.3967 remains possible. ADA Price Prediction ADA is in a sideways trend today, staying above its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as the bulls seek to push it to an uptrend. Its price action in the last three days shows that the bears and bulls are even in the market. However, it is below the 50-day SMA, a short-term bearish sentiment for the asset. Related Reading: Cardano May Sink To This Level As Bears Keep Gaining Leverage Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 40.70 in the neutral zone and moving upwards. The RSI suggests that the bulls will likely reclaim control of the asset’s price action in the coming days. ADA’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is below its signal line and showing negative values. It is a bearish sentiment for the asset, although the histogram bars are fading, hinting at a possible recovery. ADA has found strong support at the $0.3606 price level for some days, shielding it from dropping to the next support level of $0.3453. Based on its historical behavior, it will likely rally off this support level to break the $0.3767 resistance and test the next resistance level of $0.3945. Expect a positive trend soon if ADA rallies above the $0.3767 resistance. Trends On Cardano Network Cardano is a renowned developers’ hub committed to innovative network developments and trends that benefit its community. #Cardano's recent upgrades are improving interoperability, scalability and sustainability, making it an attractive blockchain for developers creating DApps.

According to the lead Cardano developers, Input Output, Hydra is a family of protocols built to improve network scalability. It functions as an off-chain mini-ledger for a small community similar to the original on-chain ledger but maximizes speed and is cost-efficient. Hydra uses smart contracts to interact with its users, processing activities like bank transfers, NFT auctions, and lightweight payments. Hydra Head is scalable, and its applications can run off-chain relieving the main chain of load and improving throughput.

12568927,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532237,1683903031,Is Pepe Coin Ready For Another Pump? Here’s What On-Chain Data Says,"Here’s what the different on-chain indicators from Santiment have to say about whether Pepe Coin could see another pump soon or not. The Memecoin’s On-Chain Metrics Have Been Down Since The Top PEPE has been one of the hottest topics around the cryptocurrency market recently, thanks to the explosive growth that the meme coin has enjoyed. Between the end of last month and the 5th of May, the coin saw its price rise by an extraordinary 1,200%. The uptrend, however, ended there and the cryptocurrency has been sharply plunging since then. According to Santiment, the on-chain analytics firm’s “social dominance” indicator signaled this top in advance. Social dominance tells us what percentage of the discussions happening on social media related to the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap are talking about a given coin. As the below chart shows, Pepe’s social dominance rose to very high values just before the top took form earlier in the month. Looks like the value of the metric has come down in recent days | Source: Santiment Whenever social dominance hits high levels, it’s a sign of euphoria among investors, which is something that has historically led to top formations for cryptocurrencies. Santiment notes that the indicator still has a value of about 5%, meaning that 5% of all discussions related to the top 100 assets involve the meme coin currently. “Seeing it get down to the 1-2% range would be a good sign that traders are beginning to stray away and look for pumps from other altcoins,” the firm explains. The active addresses metric, which measures the total number of unique addresses taking part in some transaction activity on the blockchain, also saw a spike just before the top. The metric seems to have calmed down | Source: Santiment When this indicator has a high value, it means a large number of investors are making trades right now. The price generally becomes more likely to get volatile when the metric shows such a trend. From the chart, it’s visible that the active addresses indicator has come down in value for PEPE in the last few days, which means that the market activity has calmed down. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rebounds From $27,100 After Spike In Bearish Sentiment An interesting trend is also visible in the data for the supply of the largest Pepe Coin holders, as the below graph displays. The holdings of the memecoin's whales | Source: Santiment These humongous holders had been accumulating while the rally had been going on, but right as the top took form, they started shedding coins from their wallets. Related Reading: Does The Bitcoin Price Dump Signal The Start Of Another Bear Market? This cohort has continued to sell since then as PEPE’s value has gone downhill. “If you start seeing these lines moving up again, there is a much larger probability of PEPE going for its 2nd round of pumping (though probably a more minor one),” explains Santiment. One positive sign for the asset, however, may be that the trading volume has rebounded recently after having declined since the top (just like the other metrics). The trading volume of the asset | Source: Santiment “All in all, meme coins have to be taken for what they are. They’re controlled by speculation and crowd expectations,” says the analytics firm. “In these fresh, new assets that fit this description, you’ll likely want to watch when the crowd gets too emphatic that one price direction is going to happen.” PEPE Price At the time of writing, Pepe Coin is trading around $0.000001251, down 37% in the last week.

42420432,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpw0j,1683900906,"Among Bitcoin Developers, Debate Is Raging Over Whether to Censor Ordinals BRC-20s","The staggering amount of BRC-20 tokens minted via the Ordinals protocol, which clogged the Bitcoin network and sent transaction fees sky-high, has sparked a debate among developers of the blockchain over how to tame the on-chain frenzy.  The debate is playing out on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, which hosts discussions about Bitcoin development. Opinion is divided on whether more drastic steps should be taken to curb the sudden surge in BRC-20 mints.  The soaring fees have forced some bitcoin users in Africa to seek alternative payment options including stablecoins, while crypto exchange Binance said it’s in the process of integrating the “layer 2” scaling solution for Bitcoin known as Lightning Network. It’s been a windfall for Bitcoin miners but has presented an existential conflict for purists of a blockchain designed to be a peer-to-peer payments network but also free from censorship.  “Real bitcoin transactions are being priced out,” wrote mailing list member Ali Sherief, who started the thread on Sunday. “Such justifiably worthless tokens threaten the smooth and normal use of the Bitcoin network as a peer-to-peer digital currency, as it was intended to be used.”  Sherief recommended mitigating Ordinals token mints by drafting and implementing a bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) or making changes to Bitcoin Core, the primary software for connecting to the Bitcoin network.  Not everyone agrees. Michael Folkson, an organizer for the London Bitcoin Dev meetup group, said Bitcoin should maintain its status quo.  “Consensus rules are set and the rest is left to the market,” Folkson wrote. “You may not like this use case, but assuming you embark on a game of Whac-A-Mole, what's to stop a group of people popping up in a year declaring their opposition to your use case?”  'Mass minting'  The Ordinals protocol allows users to inscribe data onto the smallest units in Bitcoin – satoshis or “sats.” The result is a unique non-fungible token (NFT).  On March 8, Twitter user Domo used Ordinals to inscribe snippets of code called JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data to enable minting of a stupendous amount of fungible tokens, some with total supply in the quadrillions, many of them practically useless.  Sherief was quick to point out that it was Domo himself who labeled his own creation “worthless.”  “These will be worthless. Please do not waste money mass minting,” Domo tweeted in March. CoinDesk reached out to Domo seeking comment on whether he still considers BRC-20s worthless but he is yet to respond.  Read more: Pump the BRCs: The Promise and Peril of Bitcoin-backed Tokens  Over 14,300 tokens have already been minted, some with a total supply of 420 quadrillion. Total market cap for BRC-20 tokens approached $1 billion earlier in the week, and Domo’s test token ORDI – created for no practical use other than to illustrate how BRC-20 minting works – is leading the pack and trading at $7.90 at the time of reporting, with a market cap of $161 million, according to CoinGecko.  That recent flurry of activity is what prompted several developers, including Sherief, to label BRC-20s as spam earlier this week and brainstorm ways to curtail the minting mayhem.  “I think everyone on this list knows what has happened to the Bitcoin mempool during the past 96 hours,” said Sherief. “Due to side projects such as BRC-20 having such a high volume.”  Bitcoin’s mempool, short for memory pool – a database of unconfirmed transactions – has indeed been congested, and at one time had nearly half a million unconfirmed transactions. The number of unconfirmed transactions was well under 50,000 for most of 2022.  'Spam filtration'  Longtime Bitcoin developer Luke Dashjr created an Ordinals spam patch filter in February called Ordisrespector that detects Ordinals transactions then rejects them. Dashjr chimed in on Sherief’s discussion thread and called for a change in Bitcoin Core that would filter out the controversial transactions, which he also referred to as spam.  “Action should have been taken months ago,” Dashjr wrote on Monday. “Spam filtration has been a standard part of Bitcoin Core since day 1.”  No change will be made to the Bitcoin protocol or to Bitcoin Core for now, so the minting appears set to continue.  “Miners are making millions of dollars from these inscription transactions,” said veteran Bitcoin Core developer, Peter Todd, in response to Dashjr. “Many people like myself will continue to run nodes that do not attempt to block inscriptions.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/12/among-bitcoin-developers-debate-is-raging-over-whether-to-censor-ordinals-brc-20s,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d48cf46242777a35f7256e1c472fe357ae7abe76-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

12567540,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532300,1683899299,Key Support Levels To Monitor As Ethereum Price Slows Down,"The Ethereum price consolidation weakened as the bulls lost momentum, resulting in a nearly 4% loss in the last 24 hours and a 7% decline on the weekly chart. The technical analysis indicates considerable bearish pressure. The coin’s value remained stagnant at around $1,800, leading to waning interest from buyers and a significant decrease in demand and accumulation. As Bitcoin dropped below $26,000, major altcoins also experienced significant declines on their daily charts. Related Reading: Cardano May Sink To This Level As Bears Keep Gaining Leverage To break its resistance, Ethereum requires substantial buyer participation, as failure to do so could lead to the loss of a crucial support level. Additionally, Bitcoin must recover and reach the $27,000 zone to initiate a short-term recovery for ETH. The declining market capitalization of Ethereum suggests a gradual departure of buyers from the market. Ethereum Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, ETH was priced at $1,770. After struggling around the $1,800 range, selling pressure eventually took over. The coin’s resistance levels were identified at $1,798 and $1,821. Conversely, if the price continues to decline, the bulls will attempt to defend ETH at $1,740. However, a failure to hold above $1,740 would push Ethereum down to $1,690. A further drop would breach the $1,540 support line. Additionally, the recent session saw a significant increase in selling strength, reflected by the red volume of Ethereum traded. Technical Analysis Following the decline from the $1,800 range, ETH has experienced a significant sell-off with a lack of recovery in buying strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) dipped below 40, suggesting a decrease in accumulation and nearing oversold territory. Additionally, ETH dropped below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that sellers have been driving the market momentum. If ETH successfully surpasses the immediate resistance level, there is a possibility of moving above the 20-SMA line. Several technical indicators on the daily chart of Ethereum began showing sell signals. One of these indicators is the Awesome Oscillator, which not only reflects price momentum but also identifies potential trend reversals. In this case, the indicator displayed growing red histograms below the half-line, indicating sell signals for the altcoin. This suggests a potential decline in price before any recovery takes place. Related Reading: Does The Bitcoin Price Dump Signal The Start Of Another Bear Market? Another indicator, the Bollinger Bands, which reveal price fluctuation and volatility, started widening. This widening suggests that Ethereum could experience increased price volatility and fluctuations in the upcoming trading sessions. This heightened volatility indicates the potential for significant price movements in either direction. Ethereum has to topple over its immediate resistance in order to stall the bears. In addition to that, broader market strength will also prove to be crucial for ETH.

According to data from Coinglass, a record of approximately 57,585 traders have been liquidated, and the total value is still counting. Notably, traders that are currently experiencing major losses with the overall downward trend of the crypto market are those who have taken long positions, speculating that the market will eventually trend upwards. Largest Liquidations On OKX And Binance Digital asset exchanges OKX and Binance recorded the largest amount of liquidations, accounting for $48.3 million and $44.94 million, respectively. The data further reveals that long liquidations amounted to approximately $114.8 million of the total liquidations, whereas short liquidations were $29.8 million. Long liquidations accounted for 79.39% of the total liquidations in the past 24 hours while short liquidation accounted for 25.96%. Bitcoin (BTC) was the most affected cryptocurrency, accounting for $50.97 million of the total liquidation. Related Reading: Why This Top Financial Expert Is Saying ‘Buy Bitcoin’ Amid Looming Bank Failures Altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH) closely followed, with $30.29 million in liquidations, while the frog-themed meme coin PEPE accounted for over $7 million. Meanwhile, the largest single liquidation occurred on OKX with a BTC-USDT swap valued at $2.61 million. It is worth noting these figures confirm that the ongoing market downturn is affecting both long and short positions. Bitcoin And PEPE Plunges The global crypto market cap has also slumped below the $1.2 trillion mark with a value of $1.14 trillion at the time of writing, down by nearly 2.5% in the last 24 hours. This decline follows the plummet from Bitcoin and the recently hyped memecoin PEPE which plunged over 20% in the past 24 hours with more than $100 million subtracted from its market capitalization. Interestingly, PEPE’s trading volume has surged in the past 24 hours indicating a possible violent sell-off. Its daily trading volume has moved from $408 million as of yesterday to $647 million in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Crypto Whale Suffers $500,000 Loss As PEPE Price Plummets Top crypto Bitcoin has also lost more than $20 billion from its market cap in the past 24 hours, down by nearly 4%, indicating selling pressure. Though Bitcoin recorded a surge in April that pushed its price to trade above $30,000, the asset has seen a bearish trend since then. The causes of the current market downturn are not entirely clear, however, it can be attributed to the US government’s recent decision to increase interest rates earlier this month may have contributed to the sell-off.

The data-sharing law, based on a model from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), is set to be agreed by finance ministers next week, and will allow tax authorities to share data within the 27-nation bloc. Commission officials have said the bill received unanimous acclaim at a meeting on Wednesday, though people familiar with the matter told CoinDesk that some finance ministers have not yet received formal approval from parliaments.  The bill, dated May 5, closely matches proposals made by the European Commission in December 2022, as part of a bid to stop EU residents stashing crypto abroad to hide it from the taxman. The commission would have to set up a register of crypto asset operators’ by December 2025, bringing forward a previous deadline by one year, and the rules will apply as of Jan. 1, 2026.  Controversially, the law – known as the eighth directive on administrative cooperation (DAC8) – still includes platforms for trading non-fungible tokens that can be used for payment or investment, and providers from outside the bloc that have EU clients.

The move to file for a patent suggests that LG sees ongoing consumer demand for NFTs in the future and sees a business case for making them more accessible.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Cardano’s scaling tool Hydra Head has gone live on the blockchain’s mainnet in the latest DeFi-focused upgrade to the network. Each Hydra Head works as a “mini ledger” shared among a small group of participants, thereby helping to speed up transactions significantly. The hope is that developers will be able to use the tools to add specialized DeFi protocols on top of Cardano, giving the network utility comparable to that of the likes of Ethereum. Cardano’s native token ADA has seen a slight uptick following the upgrade, currently ahead 1.45% in the last 24 hours, outperforming the broader crypto market, which has fallen 3.16%, according to the CoinDesk Market Index.  The Milady NFT collection spiked as much as 60% following an acknowledgement from Elon Musk, which drew parallels with the Twitter owner’s past praise for dogecoin. Miladys feature cartoon profile pic-like images with wide-eyed childlike faces, one of which Musk tweeted overlaid with the words, “There is no meme, I love you.” Following the tweet, the collection trended among the most in-demand NFTs on marketplace OpenSea, with prices as high as $13,700 worth of ether at the peak and trading volumes of over $22 million in the last 24 hours. The comparisons with dogecoin should prompt caution among traders however. While Musk’s supposed endorsement of DOGE in the past has triggered jumps in the memecoin’s price, they have often proved short-lived.  Crypto miner Hive Blockchain is planning to sell up to $100 million in common shares through an at-the-market sale in order to fund the goal of doubling its computing power. Hive is aiming to increase its hashrate from 3 exahash/second (EH/s) to 6 EH/s, part of which it says it can achieve by the end of Q2 with machines already purchased. No further details have been offered on the timeline of the sale, for which Canadian investment firms Canaccord Genuity and Stifel are to act as agents. Following the turbulence of 2022, of which several miners did not live to tell the tale, firms are now taking advantage of a modest rebound in crypto prices so far this year to set new growth and operational targets.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's 30-day options skew, or difference between what traders pay for bullish call options and bearish put options.  The skew declined to -2.37 at press time, the lowest in two months, indicating a bias for put options.  The relative richness of put options suggests a negative sentiment about spot prices.

As Kordek explained in a commentary, the Lisk Foundation wants to stake its ETH, “but it won’t happen right away.” The project gained wider notoriety during the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) craze in 2016 and 2017. At the time, the decentralized apps platform raised 14,000 Bitcoin. That sum was worth about $5.7 million at the time, making the campaign the second most successful cryptocurrency crowdfunding to that point. With a market cap of $106 million, the Lisk Token (LSK) ranks 195th among the largest cryptocurrencies according to CoinMarketCap today. At press time, LSK was trading at $0.828 and is down 5.7% in the last 24 hours. Reasons Why Lisk Is Converting Bitcoin To ETH Lisk Foundation will sell 1,000 BTC in chunks of 100 BTC per week to reduce risks with related third parties. Subsequently, the purchased ETH will be deposited into a 2-of-3 multisig account, with each Lisk Foundation board member holding one key each. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin And The Crypto Market Down Today? Notably, the project will keep 500 BTC, which the co-founder said will be used to pay expenses in 2024 and 2025. Moreover, Kordek added that the Lisk Foundation has “about enough fiat until the next Bitcoin halving.” According to Kordek, there are three reasons for this move: first, the tweet states that Ethereum is the largest blockchain platform in the world. “Treasury-wise we want to go where blockchain applications are being built,” Kordek wrote, emphasizing as a second reason that ETH has “acceptable risks” from a Treasury wise point of view. Related Reading: Winner Takes All: Bitcoin And DXY Compete For Global Financial Dominance Third, he said, it allows for a sustainable, long-term return (via staking). “Treasury-wise it makes sense to go into an appreciating, deflationary, yield-generating asset,” Kordek said.

Even though the Bitcoin and crypto market is very illiquid due to Operation Choke Point 2.0 in the United States at the moment, the impact on the Bitcoin price should be marginal due to the 1,000 BTC split over 10 weeks. 100 BTC is an order size that the market can easily digest. In the last 24 hours, the trading volume of BTC was approximately 19.4 billion. At press time, the Bitcoin price was at $26,388. For now, the key support is at the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), located at $26,227. Over the next few hours, it remains to be seen if this support can be held, if not, the area at $25,200 comes into focus.

As a result of this, the price of the digital asset has revisited the $26,000 level once more and the new bearish trend may point to more decline for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Loses $27,000 Support After a rollercoaster response to the CPI data release, the price of Bitcoin had reclaimed $27,000 and the bulls quickly tried to establish support above $27,000. This level would hold for about a day, but by Thursday, bears made easy pickings of it, dragging the price of BTC down to as low as $26,200. Related Reading: Matrixport Report: Here’s What Happens To Bitcoin If Inflation Continues To Fall This decline in price has dragged the cryptocurrency to dangerously bearish levels. One of these is the fact that it is now trading below its 50-day moving average. For a digital asset like BTC, maintaining its 50-day SMA is important, especially if the asset is going to see an upside in the coming days. BTC returns to $26,000 level | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com However, as this trend continues, it will not be surprising to see BTC lose footing above its 100-day MA. If this happens, then the digital asset could be in free fall for a while which could see it return to the $20,000 level. Unless there is a sudden turn in investor sentiment, the bear market may have returned in full bloom. Crypto Investors Becoming Wary As the price of Bitcoin has suffered, so has the sentiment of investors moved into the more negative territory. BTC’s rise above $31,000 brought the Fear & Greed Index to a high of 69 in April. However, there has since been a shift in how investors have been looking at the market. Over the last three weeks, the Fear & Greed Index has shown a 20-point decline which puts the market back into neutral territory. While this level is not necessarily bad when taken at face value, the fact that the index has declined from greed back to neutral is concerning. Fear & Greed Index turns neutral | Source: alternative.me If anything, this decline indicates that investors are becoming more wary of the market. When things like these occur, it means that investors are not willing to put money into the market. Volumes decline as a result of this and price fall in response to the lack of momentum.

After hitting the $2,000 mark last month, the price of Ethereum has dropped sharply, falling below the $1,800 level on multiple occasions. This has left investors wondering whether the bulls will step in to save the day and push the price back up. The cryptocurrency market as a whole has been experiencing a period of uncertainty, with many investors questioning the sustainability of the recent bull run. Despite these challenges, Ethereum has remained a key player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, with many investors remaining bullish on its long-term prospects. Related Reading: SPONGE Lists On 2 Major Exchanges: Will It Beat Pepe’s Solid Price Performance? Ethereum (ETH) Value Drops As Market Volatility Persists According to CoinGecko, Ethereum’s current price has taken a sharp dive, plunging to $1,760. This marks a significant 24-hour decline of 3.2% and a week-long decrease of 7.2%. This comes after Ethereum made a new high in mid-April, surpassing $2,100. Source: Coingecko Although it experienced a retracement, the $1,800 support level prevented further decline and has remained stable for the past two weeks, provided Bitcoin does not drop below $27,000. If Ethereum experiences aggressive demand at its current levels, the $1,800 support level may come to the bulls’ rescue. However, if Bitcoin drops to $26,000, Ethereum’s support level could crack, exposing it to further selloffs. In such a scenario, Ethereum could retreat to lower support levels at $1,700 or even $1,500. It’s worth noting that upper resistance levels to consider are at $2,000 and $2,100. Market-Wide Selloff Blamed For ETH Retreat As the cryptocurrency market continues to experience volatility, investors are keeping a close eye on Ethereum’s price movements. With the current drop below $1,800, many are wondering where Ethereum is heading next. Some analysts believe that Ethereum’s decline is a result of a market-wide sell-off, driven by concerns over Bitcoin’s regulatory crackdowns. Others suggest that the recent decline in Ethereum’s price could be attributed to concerns over its high transaction fees and network congestion. Looking ahead, its current support level remains a critical factor in Ethereum’s price trajectory. If the bulls step in to save the day and push the price back up, Ethereum could reclaim its previous support levels and continue its upward trend. ETHUSD loses handle on $1,800. Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: SHIB Holders, Get Ready: Latest Shiba Inu Update Could Be A Game Changer However, if the bears continue to dominate the market and push the price below the $1,800 support level, Ethereum could experience further declines. The cryptocurrency market remains unpredictable, and investors should exercise caution when making investment decisions. While Ethereum’s long-term prospects remain positive, short-term price movements are subject to a range of factors that could impact its value in the near term.

Despite being oversold based on its Relative Strength Index (RSI), other indicators were bearish, suggesting a potential further decline in price. However, SHIB has a history of responding rapidly to updates within its ecosystem, and a forthcoming Shibarium update could potentially reverse the downward trend. With the release of the Shibarium update, there may be a potential opportunity for the coin to regain its footing and improve its market performance.

Chart: TradingView.com This update indicates that the Shibarium project is making steady progress towards its launch. With the deployment of smart contracts and the successful transfer of test tokens, the team is one step closer to bringing the full potential of the Shibarium to the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Shiba Inu Price Reaction Investors and analysts had hoped that the Shibarium update would provide the much-needed boost to Shiba Inu’s market performance. However, it appears that the market sentiment towards SHIB has not changed, and the downward trend in its value has persisted. Shiba Inu suffered a decline not just in its price but also in its popularity within the crypto space, as evidenced by its dwindling social dominance. According to data from CryptoQuant, SHIB’s exchange reserve has also been on the decline, suggesting that the token is not currently under any significant selling pressure.

ETH could accelerate lower toward the $1,650 support in the near term. Ethereum is currently moving lower from the $1,850 resistance zone. The price is trading below $1,820 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,800 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent increase if there is a move above the $1,800 and $1,830 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Turns Red Ethereum’s price failed to start a recovery wave above the $1,850 resistance zone. ETH remained in a bearish zone and traded below the $1,830 support, similar to Bitcoin. The decline was such that the price even broke the $1,800 support. A new weekly low is formed near $1,770 and the price is now trading in the red zone. Ether is well below $1,820 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,800 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Immediate resistance is near the $1,800 level or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,888 swing high to the $1,770 low. The next resistance sits near $1,830 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,888 swing high to the $1,770 low, above which Ethereum could test the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a move above the $1,830 and $1,840 resistance levels, the price might rise toward the $1,880 level. Any more gains above the $1,880 resistance zone could start a decent increase toward the $1,920 resistance. More Losses in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,830 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,770 level. The next major support is near the $1,740 zone. If there is a clear move below the $1,740 support, the bears could gain strength and the price might decline heavily. The price might drop toward the $1,650 support zone in the stated case. Any more losses may perhaps take the price toward the $1,600 level in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone.

12559433,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=532213,1683875754,Why Is Bitcoin And The Crypto Market Down Today?,"Bitcoin price continues to fall, dragging the broader crypto market down with it. BTC is down 4.52% in the last 24 hours, while ETH is down 4.10%. With a current price of $26,289, Bitcoin records its lowest value since March 14 this year, when the price dipped as low as $26,544. Why Is Bitcoin And Crypto Down? As always, the reasons for the deep pullback of the Bitcoin price are complex. Remarkably, there was actually good news on Wednesday, May 10, as the CPI continued to fall causing the Bitcoin price to rise as high as $28,317. However, then fake news about an alleged sale of 9,800 BTC by the U.S. government shook the market. The Bitcoin price flash crashed as a result and has seemingly not been able to recover since. But this narrative is only half the story. A variety of other factors are currently weighing on the crypto market: the dollar index (DXY) is currently experiencing a bounce and was recently able to hold above the historically important support, the liquidity issue intensified once again with the departure of US market makers Jump and Jane Street, BTC formed a (supposed) head and shoulders pattern in the 1-day chart, the congestion of the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains and last but not least a lot of FUD (US government selling, Binance US and Grayscale). Related Reading: Whales Keep Buying Bitcoin, What They Might Know That You Don’t Not surprisingly, uncertainty in the Bitcoin and crypto market is currently quite high. The Dollar Index (DXY) is currently hovering above historically crucial support at 101.8. Since early April, DXY has already been suspiciously close to support, but has so far been able to fend off any attack from the bears. As Christopher Inks of Texas Wet Capital writes, the DXY saw another move higher yesterday (to 102.056) and is currently preventing a rally in risk assets: The $DXY rally is making longs difficult this morning. So, if you’re trying to get long on risk-off assets it’s best to wait and watch for a bit. Liquidity Issues, A Bearish Chart Pattern And FUD Another bitter blow to the crypto market on Tuesday was the news of Jump and Jane Street’s departure from the U.S. crypto market. The move by the two major market makers comes as a result of regulatory uncertainty in the US. As NewsBTC reported, liquidity has been a huge problem before, which could now get worse. Due to low liquidity, higher volatility is likely as larger buy and sell orders move the market faster. In addition, a (supposed) head and shoulders pattern on Bitcoin’s 1-day chart is currently causing fear among traders. The pattern may signal a crash to $25,000. Remember the bearish diamond pattern that everyone was shilling at 21-22k? It’s H&S now, just saying! https://t.co/2HlUIZ1XrJ pic.twitter.com/yyivuwcF82 — tedtalksmacro (@tedtalksmacro) May 12, 2023 Adding to the uncertainty has certainly been the congestion of the Bitcoin blockchain by Ordinals and the controversial BRC-20 meme coins, which are seen as a DDoS attack by part of the community. Although 300,000 transactions are still waiting for confirmation in the mempool, the problem is slowly easing. Related Reading: Winner Takes All: Bitcoin And DXY Compete For Global Financial Dominance The popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals transactions is declining.

Binance US caused a stir in the last few days because the Bitcoin price showed a high price premium. The reasons have been the subject of much speculation. Grayscale is currently being hotly debated because DCG supposedly owes bankrupt crypto lender Genesis Trading about $575 million in May, with the loans coming due next week. The rumor says that Grayscale may be selling something on Coinbase to cover the capital needed to repay the loan. At press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $26,289, initially receiving support from the 100-day EMA.

42420444,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpwE9,1683875219,Bitcoin Prices Slip to 2-Month Lows as CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Trend Indicator Turns Neutral From Bullish,"Bitcoin (BTC) continues to lose ground in the wake of CoinDesk's Bitcoin Trend Indicator shedding the bullish bias for the first time in three weeks.  The top cryptocurrency by market value fell to $26,160 before press time, reaching the lowest since March 17, according to CoinDesk data. Prices have declined by over 12% since May 6, decoupling from the uptick in traditional risk assets like Nasdaq.  The BTI indicator, which measures the directional momentum and strength in bitcoin's price, flipped from bullish to neutral on Thursday. The indicator consistently signaled an uptrend since Jan. 13, barring the brief red flash (downtrend signal) in mid-March and the neutral reading on April 24.  According to Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at Astronaut Capital, low liquidity seems to have helped few sellers drive prices lower.  ""There seems to be 'paper thin' liquidity right now, even across majors such as BTC. While we can't point at a direct reason for the weakness, any medium to large offers are driving the market down,"" Dibb said.  Liquidity or market depth has recently worsened on major exchanges, including Binance, making it difficult for traders to execute large orders without influencing prices.  According to Dick Lo, the founder and CEO of quant-driven crypto trading firm TDX Strategies, the downside move may gather pace if traditional risk assets turn lower.  ""We could get an acceleration on the downside IF U.S. equities also start to roll over,"" Lo told CoinDesk. ""$25,200 is key support for BTC followed by $23,100 on potential downside acceleration.""  Lo added that the bearish bias would be invalidated if prices rise above $28,500.  As analysts warned last week, bitcoin's drop to two-month lows has confirmed a head-and-shoulders bearish reversal pattern on technical charts.

42420437,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpw5t,1683875155,Crypto Miner Hive Blockchain Targets 6 EH/s of Computing Power Funded by Up to $100M Share Sale,"Hive Blockchain (HIVE) revealed a plan to roughly double its computing power, or hashrate, to 6 exahash/second (EH/s), in a press release on Friday.  The miner will fund its growth target through an at-the-market (ATM) sale but did not specify a timeline for the target. Hive said it will increase its hashrate from about 3 EH/s to 4 EH/s by the end of the second quarter with machines it has already purchased.  Asked about the timeline for the goal, CEO Aydin Kilic said that Hive will provide more details ""throughout the year."" The firm has focused on procuring mining rigs with the best possible return on investment, he added.  As the crypto winter that saw many miners struggle, with some filling for bankruptcy, thaws, the industry is setting its eyes on new growth and operational targets.  The miner will sell up to $100 million common shares under its ATM offering, with Canadian investment firms Canaccord Genuity and Stifel acting as agents. Each exahash of bitcoin (BTC) mining computing power will cost $30 million, so the offering could fund up to 3 EH/s of growth.  The Canadian miner also said it has purchased 1.26 EH/s of new generation machines. That includes 0.71 EH/s of Bitmain Antminer models while the rest is made up of Hive's custom rigs made with Intel (INTC) semiconductors. Intel discontinued the mining chip series in April.  The firm emphasized the power efficiency and purchase price of its mining rig fleet that will hopefully ""optimize near-term repayment of our investments from cashflow operating these machines,"" said the press release.  Hive mines both bitcoin and other crypto tokens using graphics-processing units that it repurposed from ether (ETH) mining after the Merge. As of the end of April, its hashrate was made up of 3.14 EH/s of bitcoin computing power and 0.16 EH/s of GPU mining.

The Elon Effect  Musk’s tweets have proven to cause immense jumps in the tokens mentioned by him – most popularly dogecoin (DOGE). In a tweet in May 2021, Musk stated he was working with Dogecoin developers to improve system efficiency, sending the tokens up 22% immediately.  In December 2021, dogecoin surged 33% when Musk said electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA) would accept the token as payment for its merchandise.  These jumps are short-lived, however, as traders and automated bots pile on the tokens mentioned by Musk following his Twitter comments only to sell for a handsome profit days afterward. This is typically seen in price charts as a short-term spike and a gradual sell-off.  Milady NFTs could see the same trading action in the days ahead. Prices have already corrected 7% compared to Thursday despite the high volumes – meaning a sell-off could already be in play.",NEUTRAL,DOGE | ETH,BUSINESS | DOGE | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/12/dogecoin-like-spike-in-milady-nfts-after-elon-musks-tweet-but-will-it-last,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a326246ff6a1db743870d2d735af5345d476ee8-1439x809.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $27,052, down 1.8% over the past 24 hours. BTC has been changing hands between $25,000 and $30,000 throughout the spring. A number of analysts believe it will linger there, short of a compelling reason for it to push higher – or lower.  ""Price reaction to macro data hasn't been as significant in the last few weeks,"" Katie Talati, head of research at blockchain asset management firm Arca, told CoinDesk TV. ""I think mostly, same as equities, everyone feels like a lot of the macro moves are baked in. A lot of what we've seen in the last even 24 hours, though, is much more attributable to things specific to the digital asset space.  Ether was recently trading at about $1,800, off about 1.9% from Wednesday, same time. The second largest crypto in market value has also remained largely rangebound in recent weeks, despite early April's successful Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, which completed the blockchain's transition from a proof-of-work to more energy efficient proof-of-stake protocol.  Pepecoin-inspired meme mania was waning less than a week after reaching a stunning $1.8 billion market cap. Data by crypto intelligence firm Nansen showed that by late morning Thursday (ET), “smart money” wallets – crypto accounts of individual traders or institutions who are known for their profitable moves – had decreased their PEPE stash by $3 million in the past 24 hours.  Talati said that the team behind PEPE ""did a really good job of marketing the token, really building a lot of hype around it.""  But she added: ""These tokens tend to pop up and gain a lot of notoriety when there isn't as much stuff happening in this space. They are usually the most accessible ones. A lot of newer entrants into crypto like to trade them.""  Other major cryptos were largely in the red. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of the crypto market's performance, was down 2.4%.  Equities were mixed with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and S&P 500 falling slightly but the tech-heavy Nasdaq rising a fraction of a percentage point. The banking sector declined after Los Angeles-based PacWest Bancorp reported that it had lost more than 9% of its deposits last week. But PacWest's latest problems seemed an afterthought for crypto investors.  Meanwhile, Arca's Talati was upbeat about DeFi. ""There's definitely a lot happening in DeFi,"" she said. ""I've highlighted the last few weeks, a lot of development on certain projects like Curve and Aave, both of which launched or (are) launching their own stable coin.""

Bitcoin's price has plunged from highs near $31,000 less than two weeks ago, and on Wednesday, dipped below $27,000 after markets became spooked by an unfounded rumor that the U.S. government was going to sell off some $320 million in bitcoin. The largest crypto in market value has been buffeted in recent weeks, short a compelling reason to move from a weeks-long range.  ""We've seen interest rates kind of fluctuate a little bit,"" said McDougall, whose firm provides blockchain-powered financial products. ""And the decoupling from the risk on tech stock narrative is interesting. In any time where there are so many competing narratives going on all at once, you can almost see the market sort of flipped between narratives. Is this a doomsday hedge? Is this your risk-on asset? Is the banking sector dying?""  He added ""What this seems like is an opportunity to take a deep breath – a lot of people taking profits who have been underwater for a little while, an opportunity for accumulation.""  McDougall noted that the meme pool-spurred congestion on the bitcoin network, which prompted exchange giant Binance to suspend withdrawals twice over the weekend, had raised concerns about the blockchain's ability to handle additional volume generated by NFT-like Ordinals. There are ""known challenges, and scalability is always part of that that trilemma,"" he said ""When those start to rear their head, it's easy to sort of say 'we're a little too overhyped there. Let's cool off a little bit.'""  He said that liquidity remains another issue that the crypto industry is having to address. ""It wasn't a healthy marketplace, but at least we had this sort of global connectivity of liquidity before,"" he said. ""And you're starting to see that fracture and that global assets not be able to move as smoothly cross border, and those liquidity plugs start to disconnect a little bit.""  But he was sanguine about bitcoin's future. ""A lot of these things are sort of the natural growing pains,"" he said, adding: ""How could you not be bullish? It's such a it's a no brainer to go to this technology in the long term, but the route there is not going to be straight.""  Important events.
