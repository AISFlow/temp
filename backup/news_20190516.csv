42430518,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvLHh,1558049611,Tether Ordered to Freeze Transfers to Bitfinex by New York Supreme Court,"A New York judge ordered crypto exchange Bitfinex and its affiliated stablecoin issuer Tether to turn over documentation about a loan and a line of credit Tether provided to Bitfinex.  Judge Joel Cohen, of the state's Supreme Court, echoed comments from a preliminary hearing held last week in New York City in an opinion published late Thursday, ordering Bitfinex and Tether execs and employees stop loaning Tether's reserves to Bitfinex, alongside a number of other stipulations during an ongoing investigation by the New York Attorney General's office (NYAG).  ""The Court finds that the preliminary injunction should be tailored to address OAG’s legitimate law enforcement concerns while not unnecessarily interfering with Respondents’ legitimate business activities,"" he wrote.  Specifically, the judge ordered:  Tether cannot loan any assets to Bitfinex or other parties, except in the normal course of conducting its business;  Tether cannot distribute any funds from its reserves to executives, employees, or other individuals except for payroll and normal contractor, consultant or vendor payments;  Neither Bitfinex nor Tether are allowed to modify in any way documents asked for in the NYAG's original subpoenas; and  The injunction will expire in 90 days, but the NYAG's office can petition the court to extend it two weeks before then.  Notably, the order seems to indicate that Tether can now invest its reserves as part of its normal operations. The company said in a previous court filing that it used its reserves for investment purposes, though it is unclear what it is investing those funds in.  A spokesperson for the company did not immediately return a request for comment.  In a statement, Bitfinex praised the judge's decision, writing:  ""We believe that the court’s decision today leaves no doubt that both Tether and Bitfinex are entitled to run their businesses in the ordinary course, even during the short period when this now narrowed preliminary injunction is in place.""  The exchange also said that the NYAG's office acted in ""bad faith,"" saying it ignored ""our previous historical, and voluntary co-operation with them.""  ""We will vigorously defend against any action by the New York Attorney General’s office, and we remain committed, as ever, to protecting our customers, our business, and our community against their meritless claims,"" the exchange concluded.  The judge's order comes just weeks after the NYAG secured a preliminary injunction freezing Tether's assets and asking for documents about a $625 million loan and a $900 million line of credit it offered to Bitfinex. The exchange needed to funds to continue processing customer withdrawals after losing access to some $850 million being held by Crypto Capital, a payment processor.  Crypto Capital's operators, Reginald Fowler and Ravid Yosef, were later indicted by the Department of Justice for providing illicit banking services to crypto companies.  UPDATE (May 17, 00:35 UTC): This article has been updated to note that Tether can now invest its reserves again.

42430510,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvL5h,1558048210,Startup Veil Forks Augur to Create Prediction Markets for 2020 Election,"Prediction market and derivatives platform Veil announced Wednesday that it deployed a new version of Augur, the decentralized prediction market protocol.  Called AugurLite, the application was created in order to support bets on the upcoming U.S. presidential election.  Speaking at the Token Summit conference in New York, Veil co-founder and CEO Paul Fletcher-Hill explained:  ""What we've done, is very recently we wanted to support the 2020 elections. ... No one has been able to support long-running markets on Augur, so what we've done is take some of the infrastructure to run [AugurLite].""  Augur normally is able to support long-running prediction markets. However, at present, the ethereum-based application is gearing up for a major upgrade to be activated sometime this year. As stated in a Medium post last October, the upgrade will require migration of all native Augur tokens – called REP tokens – to be moved to a new set of upgraded smart contracts.  As a result, Fletcher-Hill insisted the creation of these prediction markets on Augur now would make the bets ""susceptible to dispute"" later.  Emphasizing that AugurLite was created not as a competitor to Augur but rather out of a clear need, Fletcher-Hill also reiterated that Veil would still be supporting the main Augur application and its forthcoming upgrade.  Launched officially in January, Veil offers users a web interface to place bets on certain Augur prediction markets with greater speed and ease. As previously reported, the company does this by offering users instant settlement where outcomes of prediction markets are clear.  ""We will continue to support the creation and trading of [Augur] markets on Veil and are excited to integrate Augur v2 when it is upgraded later this year,"" Veil said via Twitter yesterday.  Mixed feelings  However, feedback on the newly released AugurLite application has been somewhat mixed.  Outside of enabling long-term bets on the 2020 U.S. presidential election, AugurLite also differs from its predecessor by relying on a different oracle service. Oracles are how real-world data is collected and represented on the blockchain.  Augur hosts a native oracle service to ensure the data being gathered by the application is true and secure. AugurLite does not have a built-in oracle but rather leaves the decision up to the prediction market creator to source from a third-party oracle.  As stated on its official GitHub page:  ""No oracle is built into the protocol. Instead, markets have a resolver which can reference any oracle—an Augur market, Chainlink feed, or any arbitrary smart contract state.""  Because of this, certain Augur community members have labeled AugurLite as a more centralized application than Augur.  ""Seems like you're losing the pieces that Augur interesting – global liquidity and trustlessness,"" Ryan Sean Adam, founder of crypto investment firm Mythos Capital, tweeted Wednesday.  To this, Joey Krug, the co-chief investment officer of Pantera Capital, also tweeted about the initiative:  ""Augur has a few value propositions: no limit, low fees, global liquidity, and being trustless is an important component of enabling that. Companies like Veil compromise on all three.""  But AugurLite according to Fletcher-Hill isn't meant to replace or compete with Augur.  ""It's not a generalizable fork, it's merely something our users had asked for these 2020 markets,"" Fletcher-Hill said.  Correction: Augur tokens are used for reporting on and disputing the outcome of events, not betting on them.  Brady Dale contributed reporting.

42430504,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvKvh,1558039809,"SEC Negotiations Have Cost Kik $5 Million, Says CEO","Kik's CEO says the company has spent $5 million engaging with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over what the regulator claims was an unregistered securities sale.  Kik, a messaging platform founded by Canadian entrepreneur Ted Livingston in 2010, raised $98 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) at the end of 2017 to support its kin cryptocurrency and ecosystem. The SEC later indicated the sale may have violated U.S. securities laws, and that SEC staff would recommend bringing an enforcement action against the company.  On Thursday, Livingston told CoinDesk at Token Summit in New York that this hasn't happened yet, but that both his firm and the regulator have been in talks since late 2017.  ""We've spent a lot of money on this, over $5 million,"" he told CoinDesk. ""We've spent a lot of time on this, we've spent the last 18 months traveling to Washington.""  In November 2018, the SEC filed a formal letter, known as a Wells notice. In Kik's response to the SEC, the company highlighted a clause in existing law that says currencies are not securities, a comment Livingston echoed Thursday.  Livingston maintains that kin is being used as a currency, adding:  ""In the last month alone, over a million people earned kin from 40 different apps, from 40 different companies. Over a quarter million people used kin, making it the most-used cryptocurrency in the world, and they’re not even willing to say that’s not a security.""  ""It just continues to drag out,"" he said.  While Livingston said he does not have any plans to sue the SEC for greater regulatory clarity, he did say the agency needs to provide clear guidance.  ""Enough is enough, you’ve been promising clarity for years now, somebody needs to go to court and get this settled,"" he said.  Livingston said he does want to work with the SEC, however.  Addressing the securities regulator, he said:  ""We want to find a win-win with you, we understand the tough position you’re in, but at the same time innovation needs to move forward.""  Regulatory uncertainty may be holding back the U.S. cryptocurrency industry, Livingston and others have argued during Blockchain Week. Developers need to pause as they try to determine what regulatory agencies might think of a particular innovation or process, he said, which slows down work.  Indeed, many companies may be afraid of regulatory action, with only one ""no-action"" letter issued by the SEC to date.  Competition is another issue, Livingston said.  ""You have companies like Binance, who look at what Coinbase does and say, ‘We’ll do that but we’ll do it everywhere but the U.S.’ – and now Binance has replaced Coinbase as the top exchange in the world,"" he explained, adding:  ""We do not want to get Binance'd.""

42430512,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvL7h,1558029617,Amazon's Arrival and 4 Other Enterprise Blockchain Trends From Consensus 2019,"The intermingling of public and private ledgers emerged as a key narrative in enterprise blockchain discussions at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2019 conference.  At the three-day event, which wrapped up Wednesday, heavyweight companies and infrastructure providers alike could be seen plotting a spectrum of blockchain strategies. Some were new entrants to the space, others were stalwarts, but these were the five storylines that shaped the enterprise conversation at the industry's biggest conference.  Amazon’s arrival  So-called “Blockchain-as-a-Service” was front and center this year, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) taking to the stage at Consensus for the first time to talk about its new Managed Blockchain Service, which deploys Hyperledger Fabric with public ethereum soon to be added.  AWS was also there to talk about its Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB), a centrally administered immutable data ledger, which Gartner predicts could eat up a sizeable chunk of the enterprise blockchain space.  This is likely to happen as companies realize they don’t need so much in the way of distributed consensus or tokenization, Gartner said, but really just an immutable system of record. (By 2021, at least 20 percent of projects envisioned to run on permissioned blockchains will instead run on centralized auditable ledgers.)  Rahul Pathak, general manager of AWS Managed Blockchain Services, chose not to speculate on whether Gartner’s claims might be accurate, but he did confirm the rumor that QLDB started life not as an alternative to permissioned chains, but rather as an internally developed tool with Amazon’s vast retail business.  Said Pathak:  “We have a very long and healthy tradition of bringing forward internally developed projects at Amazon.""  The ConsenSys contender  Meanwhile, ConsenSys-backed Kaleido was offering an array of new enterprise blockchain tools with its new B2B tech stack, part of the firm’s Blockchain Business Cloud – delivering pushbutton asset tokenization and trading, easy integration and hybrid deployment for blockchain networks.  Indeed, Kaleido has been busy in the enterprise space, with customers that include T-Mobile, Kroger, Heineken, Sony, Fox, Citi, Shell, ING, MUFG and UnionBank.  ""Kaleido has uniquely brought together all of the necessary tools and technologies on our platform in a single, integrated B2B stack,” Kaleido founder and CEO Steve Cerveny said in a statement.  Sticking with ethereum, ConsenSys “Seeker of Awesomeness” John Wolpert told CoinDesk that his team is advancing to use the ethereum mainnet as a kind of decentralized middleware or message bus, allowing companies to interact peer-to-peer but keeping a common frame of reference.  “Side chains are the key thing,” said Wolpert, “but we need to give them another name.”  Joining the conversation, Wayne Vaughan, CEO of Tierion, which is building the world’s first global proof engine, said his company was about to announce that it would be using its Chainpoint application to anchor Hyperledger to the bitcoin blockchain.  Wolpert, who was a founding engineer of Hyperledger Fabric while at IBM, countered: “Now, you’ve got to ask, Why do you need to do that?”  Herding cats  Blockchain is a team sport, as they like to say in the enterprise space. That’s why gathering firms together and building consortia to build and execute the technology has become an art in itself. A panel exploring the state of play was aptly named “Herding Cats.”  Brian Behlendorf, executive director of Hyperledger (a chief DLT cat herder), pointed out it’s useful to break down the topic into three basic types of enterprise blockchain consortia:  “There are pure technology consortiums like Hyperledger. There are standards consortiums like the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. And then there are consortiums focused on one particular vertical, so something like we.trade would be a good example of that.”  Joining Behlendorf, Susan Joseph of B3i, the reinsurance consortium which includes Allianz, Swiss Re and Zurich, was also categorical about consortia governance.  Said Joseph:  “It’s a people problem.""  CSD update  Central securities depositories or CSDs (think: banking for securities) have probably had more than their fair share of threats about disintermediation, as the world has woken up to the fact that those assets can easily be tokenized and live on blockchains.  Debating an uncertain future for this type of industrial-grade market infrastructure were two of the big players: the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).  DTCC was early to embrace the power blockchain could bring to the fragmented, reconciliation-heavy, post-trade environment. It has taken on an ambitious project to run the Trade Information Warehouse (TIW) on distributed ledger tech, which will automate recordkeeping, lifecycle events and payment management for approximately $10 trillion of cleared and bilateral credit derivatives.  This undertaking is now being tested by a group of banks and is on track to meet its deadline later this year, Robert Palatnick, managing director and chief technology architect at DTCC, confirmed to CoinDesk.  “There’s a lot of work going on right now, but we are looking good and on course,” he said.  ‘Security token or tokenized security?’  Meanwhile, LSEG blockchain architect Michael Coletta said he wanted to clear up some confusion in the space with regard to regulation:  “On the question of security token or tokenized security, I would humbly respond by saying it doesn’t matter and is only semantic. Let’s remember to distinguish the legal and the technological. Security, legal; token, technical. To the extent that regulation endeavors to be technologically neutral, and it does, usually, the token concept is irrelevant when considering the legal.”  Ajit Tripathi of ConsenSys conceded that a recent white paper from DTCC, which stated that security token offering (STO) platforms should have the same characteristics from a regulatory perspective as existing trading systems, “seemed logical” but questioned where the likes of DTCC would be once the infrastructure revolution happens.  Tripathi said:  “Securities will be registered on the blockchain, which is already happening in some jurisdictions. Central bank money will be issued in token form, and then we will have DVP [delivery versus payment]. OK, so that might seem far off, but what are you doing now to not be disintermediated?”  Taking a more sober view of certain types of runaway innovation, Preston Byrne, an attorney at Byrne & Storm, took issue with the concept of “superfluid collateral” during a discussion around decentralized finance, adding:  “I like to have my collateral super encumbered.”  Rahul Pathak image via by Emily Kim of Ground X",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/16/amazons-arrival-and-4-other-enterprise-blockchain-trends-from-consensus-2019,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/47d280095bca611bf09abdd66e22528ac122ce7e-960x642.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430524,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvLTh,1558028233,MakerDAO Votes to Decrease Stablecoin Fees for First Time in 5 Months,"For the first time in five months, token holders behind the programmatic loan system MakerDAO have voted to decrease fees on all DAI loans.  DAI is a dollar-pegged stablecoin operating on the ethereum blockchain that is currently backed in value by nearly 2 million ether tokens. Since the beginning of this year, the value of DAI has fallen below $1 as a result of market supply and demand imbalances. In an effort to contract the DAI supply with the goal of raising its trading price, MakerDAO token holders have incrementally increased fees on the MakerDAO system issuing new DAI tokens.  Called the Stability Fee, interest accrues over time on all DAI loans taken out from the MakerDAO system. Over the course of five months, the Stability Fee has increased 39 fold from 0.5 percent to 19.5 percent, sparking outrage from some early borrowers in the MakerDAO system.  Since the most recent increase of 3 percent executed two weeks ago, DAI prices across major cryptocurrency exchanges and over-the-counter trading desks now looks to have pushed past dollar valuation trading as high as $1.06.  Today's vote marks the second time in MakerDAO's history where token holders have voted for a two percent decrease to the Stability Fee in order to address high DAI demand.  Tomorrow, voters will again stake their tokens to execute the decrease into the MakerDAO system in a continuous polling round where a minimum of 117,631.90 MKR tokens must be staked in support of this proposal.  Turnout concerns  Regarding today's preliminary round of voting, MakerDAO head of community development Richard Brown expressed during a governance risk call today his discomfort at the lack of voter turnout.  According to Brown, only two MakerDAO token holders voted for the 2 percent decrease collectively staking 54,000 MKR tokens.  What's more, one MakerDAO token holder appeared to ""troll"" the system by staking 17,000 MKR in favor of further increasing the Stability Fee by another 4 percent despite the clear overvaluation of DAI in the markets.  ""We desperately need people to lock up their Maker [tokens],"" insisted Brown on today's call. ""It doesn't take a lot for another voter to come out and outweighs the on 17K Maker troll that was trying to raise the Stability Fee by 4 percent.""  Brown added:  ""If you're a person who think your vote doesn't matter in the system that's a self-fulfilling prophecy...If community members believe the system should head in direction 'x' then the community needs to self-organize for 'x'.""  Correction: A previous version of this article suggested the continuous polling round requires a minimum of 35,000 MKR staked instead of 117,000 MKR.

42430515,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvLFh,1558025200,"Ava Labs Exits Stealth, Launches Blockchain Testnet Based on 'Avalanche' Protocol","Blockchain startup Ava Labs is coming out of stealth and starting to open up its blockchain network -- backed by a new consensus algorithm -- to developers and users.  Ava Labs is launching a private testnet of their technology today at Token Summit, one of the many conferences taking place during Blockchain Week NYC.  Though the blockchain network isn't ready for real money quite yet, this step is notable because, for the first time, developers outside the organization will be able to put the new code to the test based on their “Avalanche” protocol that was released last year by a pseudonymous group going by the name ""Team Rocket,"" referring to the villains of the Pokémon game series.  Ava is releasing the code to their launch partners, who will be able to comb through it, battle-test it, and play around with it for the first time. The code will not be completely open sourced quite yet, as Ava Labs founder and Cornell professor Emin Gun Sirer told CoinDesk. Once the code has been ""scrutinized"" further, a public version of the testnet will be opened up for wider use.  Backing the effort is the $6 million that Ava Labs raised in February during a previously undisclosed funding round, when it won support from notable names in the venture capital and cryptocurrency spaces. These include Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain, former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, Metastable, Initialized and Ramtin Naimi of Abstract Ventures.  Ava's project forms part of a much wider degree of interest within the academic world in exploring consensus protocols that serve the same purpose of proof-of-work -- securing transactions -- but are more energy-efficient and have the potential to provide a basis for democratic development and the inclusion of more users in the consensus process. (Though it's worth noting that some experts are skeptical that protocols with similar goals work in practice -- so far, at least.)  Still, Sirer argues that Ava Labs' implementation of Avalanche represents a breakthrough and a step forward for the ecosystem as a whole.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We already have something that works and want to show people who are interested in it.""  Proof-of-work itself is revolutionary, Sirer contends, as it revolutionized what researchers thought were possible of consensus protocols for 45 years. ""This third approach combines the best of both worlds,"" he said.  He added that Ava is faster and more scalable, ""allowing us to open up a new level of decentralization.""  A 'different' universe  Ava Labs also claims to have made another ""breakthrough"" that Sirer says is just as revolutionary as Avalanche, but hasn't been revealed until today.  It boils down to this: in all blockchains launched thus far, all the nodes have to agree on certain criteria. All nodes utilize the same ""scripting language"" for smart contracts, for example.  Ava, by contrast, offers a ""heterogeneous network,"" allowing nodes across the system to have different properties. Essentially allowing different groups in the network to ""plug-and-play"" different features.  ""This is a different type of a universe,"" Sirer said, comparing Ava to other popular public blockchains like EOS and ethereum. ""Ava has an interoperable framework, but then you have smaller and smaller universes of your own that have minimum properties.""  One could decide to add zk-SNARKS, a bleeding-edge privacy technology, in their own universe, for example. Still, it's worth noting that some researchers are skeptical of Avalanche, the new concept Ava is putting into practice.

42430511,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvL9h,1558018811,Ripio Is Launching a Crypto Exchange for 3 Latin American Nations,"UPDATE May 16, 18:30: The article was updated with new information from Ripio on the exchange launch date.    –––––––––    Ripio, a startup that's been working to boost crypto adoption in Argentina, is opening a new exchange platform for three Latin American markets.  The exchange will operate in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, though due to regulatory hurdles, only fixed-price purchases will be available for Mexican users, Ripio CEO Sebastian Serrano told CoinDesk at Consensus 2019. The company already offers a crypto wallet and peer-to-peer lending, and is launching over-the-counter (OTC) trading for institutional investors alongside the exchange.  The crypto community in Argentina looks similar to the crowd at Consensus, Serrano said. Ripio users are by and large “early adopters, avid investors and technophiles.”  Serrano said:  “For the next wave, we need to prepare ourselves to go mainstream and reach bigger audience.”  And this won't be your standard crypto exchange, he continued. Ripio aims not only to provide crypto trading but to educate users who may be new to trading on exchanges.  Education first  First-time users of Ripio's new exchange will only be allowed to buy and sell crypto for a fixed price and will be provided with educational materials on how trading works, such as video tutorials, podcasts, daily news, blog posts and a forum.  As they complete more transactions and become more advanced, they will be able to make limit and other, more complex, orders, Serrano said.  “We want to take someone who’s just curious about crypto and help them to go up to the advanced user,"" he explained. “If you immediately expose people to a very difficult [trading] interface they will end up hurting themselves or giving up.”  The exchange will also offer users basic information on each of the assets available. Further, for regulatory reasons, Ripio will enable only spot trading, and no derivatives. However, the company is working with Argentinean regulators to launch security token trading at some point in the future, Serrano said.  While the new platform is planned to launch in mid-June, it’s currently in beta phase testing with around 1,000 users and Ripio’s 80 staff members.  Stores, loans, ICO  Founded in 2013 as Bitpagos, the firm rebranded as Ripio in 2014. The company boasts over 300,000 users in Latin America, aged between 25 and 40, according to its own data.  It's been working to provide real-world fiat on-ramps in Argentina and to encourage convenience stores to sell small amounts of bitcoin. According to Ripio, now there are around 8,000 stores across the country offering the service. Users can deposit fiat currency at the stores and fund their bitcoin accounts at Ripio, using it as a savings vehicle.  Another service provided by Ripio is its peer-to peer credit network. According to Serrano, around 500 loans are now in the system, with an average loan size around $100.  Ripio raised $37 million during an ICO in 2016, selling the RCN tokens powering the credit network. In 2017, it raised another $2.25 million in a Series A funding round led by China-based VC fund Huiyin Blockchain Venture and including $428,000 from Overstock's venture subsidiary Medici Ventures.

42430500,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvHJh,1558009856,Litecoin Price Hits 11-Month High Above $100,"The price of litecoin (LTC) was quoted in three digits across cryptocurrency exchanges earlier today.  The fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization jumped to $107.71 at 02:00 UTC, the highest level since June 12, 2018, according to CoinDesk’s Litecoin Price Index.  The bullish move has stalled in the last few hours, though, with the price currently trading around $94, representing a 1 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Litecoin isn’t the only crypto rallying today, either. Other prominent cryptocurrencies like ethereum’s ether, XRP, EOS and Binance coin are also flashing green. Notably, ether (ETH) jumped to $272 earlier today, the highest level since Sept. 5 and is currently the best performing top 10 cryptocurrency of the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.  The alternative crypto assets have found love in the last 48 hours as bitcoin's bullish momentum is showing signs of weakness. The leading cryptocurrency by market value printed a fresh 10-month high of $8,360 in Asian trading hours today, only to quickly fall back below $8,000, as per CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.  With bitcoin struggling to maintain gains above $8,000, investors may continue to pour money into altcoins. Litecoin, in particular, could shine bright over the next few weeks, as the mining reward halving is now less than 90 days away.  On Aug. 6, the reward for mining coins on litecoin’s blockchain will drop from current 25 LTC to 12.5 LTC. The process, aimed at curbing inflation, is repeated every four years and markets tend to price in the supply-altering event well in advance, according to historical data.  LTC/USD and LTC/BTC daily charts  LTC/USD (above left) jumped above $100 earlier today, as expected, having witnessed a falling wedge last month and an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on May 14.  The bullish price action is accompanied again by an overbought reading an (above-70 reading) on the relative strength index (RSI).  However, with reward halving due in less than three months, pullbacks, if any, will likely end up fueling stronger price rallies toward $155, which is the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from December 2017 highs to December 2018 lows.  The bullish view would be invalidated if LTC violates the current higher lows, higher highs pattern on the RSI with a move below 68.83. That could happen if bitcoin falls sharply toward $5,000.  Even then, LTC may outperform BTC, courtesy of the reward halving boost, leading to a big rise in LTC/BTC, which is currently trapped in a falling channel (above right).

Meme Factory is built on ethereum and allows users to create, issue and trade “provably rare” digital collectibles, according to an announcement.  The platform was created by blockchain startup District0x Network, which raised $9 million via an initial coin offering in August 2017. The funding was raised in ether (ETH) cryptocurrency and saw participation from venture capital firms Boost VC and CoinFund.  District0x describes the platform as ""a true decentralized digital collectibles marketplace, completely self-governed and functioning autonomously on the ethereum blockchain.""  So how does it work? The marketplace enables users such as artists to create original tokenized memes and submit them for consideration to what's dubbed the Dank Registry. Registry curators, who are holders of the project's DANK token, will then scan the submissions and decide which memes will make it to the platform. Finally, collectors can buy those memes using ETH, according to the announcement.  According to District0x:  “These provably rare memes will exist indefinitely on the blockchain, giving a strong incentive to create and collect as many as possible.""  The firm told CoinDesk last year that, once the platform is fully built, entrepreneurs will be able to build websites, what it terms “districts,” to develop communities around a range of purposes.  Districts will be decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that enable posting, searching, reputation and payments using District0x’s software. Outside of Meme Factory, for example, District0x also built Name Bazaar, which allows users to buy namespaces on ethereum.  “We see blockchain and tokens allow all kinds of uses that were never possible before,” said co-founder Joe Urgo at the time.  Originally scheduled for Wednesday, District0x said on Twitter that the launch is now expected Thursday.

42430502,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvHPh,1558003555,"Bitcoin Faces Price Correction Toward $7.6K, Technical Charts Suggest","View  Bitcoin printed a 10-month high of $8,390 earlier today only to fall back quickly below $8,000, strengthening the bearish divergence of the 4-hour chart relative strength index (RSI). The daily RSI is also teasing bearish divergence.  BTC risks falling to a potential double-top neckline at $7,619. A break lower would open the doors to sub-$7,000 levels (target as per the measured height method).  The case for correction in the next day or two would weaken if the price rises back above $8,300.  Bitcoin (BTC) could be in for a price correction, as exhaustion leaves the bulls unable to hold onto fresh 10-month highs hit earlier today.  The cryptocurrency market leader jumped to $8,390 on Bitstamp at 1:00 UTC, the highest level since July 25, 2018. However, the rise was short-lived as expected, with prices falling back to $7,740 within the last hour. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,840, representing a 2 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Essentially, the cryptocurrency has failed twice in the last 48 hours to keep gains above $8,300, which validates the extreme overbought conditions reported by the widely followed relative strength index (RSI).  While the pullback from highs above $8,300 on May 14 was reversed by the 50-hour moving average (MA) support, the latest fall has taken prices below that line. As a result, a deeper correction is looking increasingly likely.  4-hour chart  BTC has dived out the bullish channel and could end up forming a double-top bearish reversal pattern with the neckline support at $7,619.  A slide to that key support looks likely, as the RSI printed another lower high earlier today, contradicting BTC’s rise to fresh 10-month highs, and is now reporting a descending triangle breakdown.  A 4-hour close below $7,619 would confirm a double-top breakdown and create room for a drop to levels below $6,900 (target as per the measured move method).  Daily chart  The RSI on the daily chart is also beginning to diverge from the uptrend in price, signaling weakening bullish momentum.  The 10-day MA, currently at $7,036, is still trending north, indicating a bullish setup. As a result, pullbacks to $7,000, if any, could be short-lived.  The short-term outlook would turn bearish if and when prices find acceptance below the historically strong support of the 30-day MA, currently at $5,923.  The case for a pullback would weaken if the price rises back above $8,300. Although, with the RSI well above 70.00, the bulls may have a tough time forcing sustainable rally to next key resistance at $8,500 (July 2018 high).

42430499,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvHNh,1557999611,Just 376 Individuals Hold 33% of All Ether Cryptocurrency: Chainalysis,"A third of all ether, ethereum's native cryptocurrency, is owned by just 376 whales as of May 1, new research indicates.  Blockchain analysis startup Chainalysis published a study on Wednesday, indicating that, while these 376 individuals control 33 percent of the circulating supply in 2019, that number is actually down from levels seen in 2016 and 2017.  The study also found these whales have “no meaningful” impact on the ETH price, but they do increase intraday volatility in the cryptocurrency market when they make large sell-offs.  Chainalysis defines whales as the top 500 holders of cryptocurrency, excluding services, who store their holdings off exchanges. It found that ether whales currently account for just 7 percent of all transaction activity.

The study also analyzed the impact of whales sending and receiving funds to and from exchanges using a VAR model.

The institutions announced Wednesday that their successful recording of a secondary transaction for bond-i, a blockchain-operated debt instrument, on a distributed ledger shows the ""vast potential"" of the technology, and marks the first bond to have both issuance and trading recorded on a blockchain platform.  Bond-i was first issued last August by the World Bank, with the CommBank being a sole arranger. The experiment helped the World Bank raise $81 million at the time.  World Bank vice president and treasurer, Jingdong Hua, said:  “Enabling secondary trading recorded on the blockchain is a tremendous step forward towards enabling capital markets to leverage distributed ledger technologies for faster, more efficient, and more secure transactions.”  The blockchain platform was built and developed by the CommBank's Blockchain Centre of Excellence on top of the ethereum network, and was reviewed by Microsoft regarding its architecture, security and resilience.  CommBank Innovation Labs’ head of experimentation & commercialization, Sophie Gilder, commented:  “Blockchain has the potential to streamline processes for raising capital and trading securities, improve operational efficiencies, and enhance regulatory oversight.”  CommBank first revealed a plan to issue a bond over a blockchain system as far back as 2017, saying it was working with an unnamed “major world issuer.”  Other financial institutions across the globe have been recently testing blockchain-based systems for bond issuance, including Santander, Societe Generale and Abu Dhabi-headquartered Al Hilal Bank.

42430496,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvHDh,1557993600,Can Bitcoin Win the Digital Payments 'Gauge War'?,"Simon Johnson is a Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship, MIT Sloan School of Management.  The following article originally appeared in Consensus Magazine, distributed exclusively to attendees of CoinDesk’s Consensus 2019 event.      The promise and potential of bitcoin as a technology is frequently described in terms of a platform. On top of bitcoin’s permissionless blockchain, the argument goes, all kinds of things could be built to reduce the power and profit of trusted intermediaries. If you fear and resent monopolies, particularly those that are becoming more obnoxious as the digital age progresses, this is an alluring future.  It may also be an illusion. Not only are the use cases so far rather limited, but increasingly implementations – upon closer inspection – turn out to be “permissioned” blockchains, which are actually some form of relatively centralized shared database controlled by trusted intermediaries.  The terminology and rhetoric may have changed, for activities such as organizing supply chains or clearing financial transactions, but the reality looks remarkably similar to what existed before bitcoin was invented. Bitcoin’s arrival, and the disruptive potential it vaguely represented seemed to goad various industries into exploring an old form of distributed database technology. But this is hardly a revolution.  Will bitcoin ever have a more meaningful impact on society than this?  Before we ponder that more deeply, let’s pause and reflect on what definitely already exists. Bitcoin has proved to be a remarkably robust means of making certain kinds of payments. It is also a store of value, albeit one that is highly volatile. Of course, bitcoin has also spawned a variety of other cryptocurrencies, which range from being reasonable propositions to completely unappealing.  In speculating on whether bitcoin and its imitators can progress beyond these modest beginnings, one important historical analogy is useful: the development of railways in the UK. Some initial railways were highly profitable (e.g., the Liverpool-Manchester line) and others were miracles of engineering (the Great Western) but in various senses less successful. Many of them were more humdrum. There was excessive competition in what became known as “The Gauge War,” as well as crazy moments of speculation and plenty of outright fraud. It was the first big capitalist boom, and it set the tone for pretty much everything else that followed.  A case study in disruption  What did railways really accomplish? There were three major impacts, some but not all of which were clear at the beginning.  First, railways broke the grip that canals had on the movement of heavy goods. Turnpikes, or toll roads, were fine for small-scale movement of passengers, but anything heavier needed to go by barge. Not surprisingly, canal owners were generally opposed to railway development, spawning fights that went on for years. This pitched battle was obvious to everyone who understood the transportation element in the pricing of coal and other traded goods.  Second, railways encouraged people to travel. The number of people traveling by rail, for example between Liverpool and Manchester, quickly surpassed the number who had been brave enough to take a stagecoach.  Third, railways created new jobs, but they also destroyed livelihoods. The people who ran and otherwise benefited from turnpikes did not do well. Over several decades, railways were a net positive on the jobs front – including many occupations that were relatively well-paid (although other jobs were most definitely dangerous and underpaid by any reasonable metric). The scale and scope of the economic and social impact was impressive – and likely a surprise to most people.  Most canals eventually went out of business, but what’s striking is how long it took. Some waterways remain financially viable at least until the end of the nineteenth century – roughly 60 years after the railway proof of concept was fully established – even though canal owners had done nothing new or clever to assure their survival.  A canal is a canal; there’s not much you can do to invest or upgrade this kind of physical infrastructure. The response on the side of the roads was quite different.  Over time, road surfaces improved a great deal. And the internal combustion engine, which gave rise to the automobile, proved to be a technological shift just as profound as putting a steam engine on wheels. Nothing lasts forever, as the owners of railway company stock discovered.  Take all of this back to bitcoin and assume that only the narrow version survives – solely a payments system. This could still be a major potential competitive threat to all forms of financial gatekeeper, but only insofar as bitcoin can outcompete its rivals among other means of digital payments. Various companies in this arena are trying to build railroads – some focused on functionality, others aiming for more elegant solutions.  But for the customer, it’s just about getting from A to B fastest at the lowest cost.  You really don’t care how Venmo works, or what happens when you use Apple Pay in a cab or receive a confirmation from PayPal, or even how your credit card works in a foreign chip & PIN sign system. All you care about is: did you know what the price was going to be, and could you settle in a way acceptable to both the payee and you. Various entities are holding risk within that payments system, but not you – at least not in a way that gives you any concern.  Bitcoin’s opportunity lies in how well it too can enable more seamless, low-cost digital transactions for people. (I don’t see bitcoin as a rival for cash, which will rise or fall in various societies, depending on whether people like immediate anonymous settlement – and how they feel about carrying around physical bundles with that characteristic.)  We go with what works  How will this shake out? Let’s take a lesson from Isambard Kingdom Brunel, builder of the Great Western Railway. Impressive engineering is good, but interoperability trumps it.  Brunel’s railway had a broader gauge than most other British lines, but it was eventually forced to adopt those standard gauges to connect with other lines. In the end, the network effect prevails – we go with what works more often and in more places.  Bitcoin may have helped spark the railroad age but there is no guarantee it will win. In fact, currently, it looks more like the Great Western – gets the job done, but at relatively high cost in a small community of users, and with features that can only be regarded as strange.  (The oddest part of the Great Western operation was a century-long contract (!) that required all London-Bristol trains to stop in Swindon, where there were monopoly providers of refreshments to that line. Lesson for crypto developers: long confirmation times and erratic spikes in transaction fees may seem attractive to some engineers; to ordinary customers these are discouraging.)  Bitcoin could still win the competition to provide better, cheaper, more reliable payments. Recent steps promised by Bakkt, for example, can be regarded as encouraging if they bring bitcoin closer to being used in mainstream commerce (e.g., for Starbucks). And every time I hear about the Lightning Network from a colleague at MIT, I also feel that the system is moving in the right direction toward low-cost, peer-to-peer payments.  Still, remember, the railway customer does not care if the railway will strengthen or undermine existing landowners or shake up the structure of power. Similarly, whether particular intermediaries will rise or fall is generally a matter of some indifference.  All that matters is: will the trains run on time, and how much does it cost to buy a ticket?
