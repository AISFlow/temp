Bitcoin gold alerted exchanges and mining pools of the attack on July 2, and posted a notice to the community on July 10 noting that it was time for ""everyone else to upgrade their nodes.""  The team only revealed the attempted network takeover to the public after the unknown attacker, which had been mining blocks since July 1, released 1,300 blocks late Friday night.

That checkpoint prevented the attacker’s chain from taking over the honest chain, they said Friday.  “The majority of honest pool hashpower continues to mine on the honest chain,” website maintainer CryptoDJ said in the post.  According to the cryptocurrency's official website, there are only 108 bitcoin gold nodes in the world. Nearly 30% of them are in Germany. Bitcoin Gold communications director Edward Iskra told CoinDesk that these only represent immediately responsive nodes, and not ones that don't allow incoming connections.
