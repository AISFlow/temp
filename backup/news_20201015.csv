42432952,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2HZh,1602793371,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Tests $11.5K; Ether Futures Open Interest Flattens,"Bitcoin is turning bullish Thursday while ether futures open interest sticks around $1 billion the past month.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $11,537 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 1.5% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,249-$11,543  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price is on the rise Thursday, moving from a mostly flat trend to hit as high as $11,543 on spot exchanges such as Bitstamp. It was changing hands at $11,537 as of press time.      The move upward arrives as the world’s oldest cryptocurrency has struggled to stay above $11,500 since Oct. 13. Andrew Tu, an executive at trading firm Efficient Frontier, said this phenomenon, often known as “resistance” where traders take profits, creates sell momentum and holds back bitcoin from pushing higher.      “There is significant resistance past $11,400,” Tu told CoinDesk. “It may be that we fail to stay above $11,500 and begin to range from $10,500-$11,400.” With the exception of a quick bounce to as high as $11,730 on Oct. 13, bitcoin has been in $11,400-$11,500 territory most of the past week.      “Looking back at 2020 so far, bitcoin is on a nice and steady walk upwards,” said Henrik Kugelberg, an over-the-counter crypto trader based in Sweden. “It is very fortunate that we have bitcoin to look at when most other macro things look gloomy, to say the least.”      Read More: World’s Growing Stockpile of Negative-Yielding Debt a Positive for Bitcoin      BItcoin is trouncing traditional investment hedges such as gold and even silver. While gold is up 26% in 2020 and silver has gained 35%, bitcoin has climbed 57%.      “There will always be plunges, bull runs and plateaus with bitcoin,” Kugelberg added. “But I am confident we have not seen all the effects of the amazing developments in and around bitcoin.” One of these developments has been the increasing number of publicly traded companies holding some bitcoin as a reserve asset, something Kugelberg sees as a bullish driver.      Efficient Frontier’s Tu sees significant upside if bitcoin can get over the $12,000 price point. “If we do successfully break $12,000 we could see BTC sharply rise, as there are few historical resistance lines past this point,” he added.    Ether futures flatten    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Thursday trading around $378 and climbing 0.74% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: How the DeFi Craze Made Its Way to China      The ether futures market has stagnated in the past month, hovering around $1 billion in open interest per day after hitting record numbers on Aug. 15 and Sept. 1, when it briefly surpassed $1.7 billion.      Vishal Shah, a crypto options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, says the earlier open interest spike can be attributed to the decentralized finance, or DeFi, frenzy.      “The way I look at that chart is by extracting out the mid-July to mid-September open interest change. That was the DeFi effect,” Shah said. “Now we are mostly tracking broader industry growth with some elements around Ethereum 2.0 keeping hopes high.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed, mostly red Thursday.

Audit firms CoinDesk spoke with said they are swamped with decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. The months-long backlog comes amid a sharp pullback across the $11 billion DeFi market, with most tokens down 19% over the last 30 days, according to Messari.      Audit firm OpenZeppelin, which has overseen audits on DeFi staples such as Compound and Augur, said it is “seeing an overwhelming demand for audits” and is booking clients “well out into Q1 2021.”      “We're seeing a lot of requests for governance token clones of varying quality,” OpenZeppelin Marketing Lead David Steinrueck told CoinDesk in an email.      Juliano Martinez, technical writer at audit firm Quantstamp, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message that the “high volume” of applicants has led to his company “rejecting lots of projects.”      The separation between audited projects and non-audited projects became palpable over DeFi’s boom months – often referred to as “DeFi Summer” – as code flaws in some projects led to contracts being exploited by hackers. In fact, some projects such as “monetary experiment” Yam.Finance openly flaunted being unaudited.      Read more: DeFi Meme Coin YAM Succumbs to Fatal ‘Rebase’ Bug, Makes Plans for ‘YAM 2.0’    A three-month 'lead time' for DeFi audits    Trail of Bits co-founder and CEO Dan Guido, on the other hand, told CoinDesk in an email the firm is running a typical three-month “lead time” before a new project can be audited.      Guido said Q4 has always been a busy quarter for DeFi audit firms as “institutional clients try to spend their remaining cash before the end of the year.”      Trail of Bits also conducted audits on three Ethereum 2.0 clients including Nimbys, Prysm and Lighthouse ahead of that project’s presumed late-autumn launch.

42432946,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2HNh,1602779934,Nigeria Is Developing Strategies for National Blockchain Adoption,"Nigeria’s federal government is reportedly developing an ambitious plan to facilitate national crypto adoption with the vision of creating a “Digital Nigeria.”    According to an early draft of the strategy framework obtained by local publication Technology Times, the country’s Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy and the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) have partnered to develop a blueprint for national blockchain adoption.  The project was confirmed by a blockchain engineer who worked on the draft.  Aptly titled the “National Blockchain Adoption Strategy,” the document states that facilitating blockchain adoption is part of a larger effort by Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari to diversify the Nigerian economy.  Protests have erupted across Nigeria, with citizens marching against police brutality, including calling for the disbandment of the special anti-robbery squad SARS. Buhari has come under fire for renaming – rather than disbanding – SARS.  Protest groups in Nigeria have accused the government of interfering with traditional fundraising methods, and have begun raising funds using the Bitcoin system to circumvent censorship.  According to the new framework, the idea is to “use blockchain technology as a platform for the transition into a digital economy.”  In 2017, the Central Bank of Nigeria declared digital currencies are not legal tender in Nigeria, while the country’s Securities and Exchange Commission warned against the risks of investing in digital assets.  But last month regulators showed interest in governing the space, with Nigeria's SEC saying it will treat all cryptocurrencies and token offerings as securities.  Now, the proposed adoption framework includes an initiative to create a legal framework for governing the crypto space.  The draft also outlined five strategic objectives: establishing regulatory oversight; stimulating innovation and entrepreneurship; developing security, trust, and transparency in value chains; encouraging investment opportunities and job creation; and governance.

Announced Thursday during the Stellar Development Foundation’s quarterly review call, the addition of the dollar-backed stablecoin seeks to bolster Stellar’s standing as a cross-border payments network.      “We are focused on creating equitable access to the financial system by building a global network that delivers services to users regardless of their geography,” Stellar Development Foundation CEO Denelle Dixon said in a statement, adding:    “The addition of USDC to Stellar will allow us to continue to expand our global reach in pursuit of this mission while opening up new avenues for growth and innovation for the developers and businesses building on the network.""    According to CENTRE – the USDC consortium jointly led by Circle and Coinbase – there are around 2.8 billion USDC in circulation. Stellar, which is primarily used by financial institutions for cross-border transactions, has 4.6 million accounts.      Stellar will be the third official chain for USDC, having launched on Ethereum and expanding to Algorand in June 2020. Stellar says the coin should be available on its network by January 2021.

The Stellar addition is part of the CENTRE’s multichain approach to USDC.      “We value the increased interoperability and wide range of developers that the Stellar network brings to the table, and look forward to seeing how adding a strong and stable USD anchor to Stellar grows its ecosystem and its importance as a platform driving global financial inclusion,” Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said in a statement.      The next version of the Stellar protocol will be deployed in Q4 with a pair of new features, Stellar’s Justin Rice said on the call.      Added Dixon:    “Just having USDC is going to open up more opportunities and corridors.”    Stellar also announced the dates for its second Meridian conference, a free virtual event held this year Nov. 16-20.

Not to mention, Filecoin has pivoted to mainnet.    Top shelf    Filecoin flies The Filecoin network mainneted at 14:44 UTC, beginning its FIL token distribution. Filecoin is a system from Protocol Labs meant to be both a decentralized file storage and content distribution network in one. The new token is very likely to make history as the fastest newly live blockchain to reach a market capitalization of over a billion dollars, though we can’t really know until the FIL tokens enter trading. Despite multiple delays, the Filecoin project has attracted considerable attention, particularly in China, where investors have been speculating heavily on the network’s mining hardware and the FIL token.      M&A Up&Up The value of crypto M&As in the first half of 2020 has already surpassed that of full-year 2019, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers report. Around $597 million was spent in 60 deals in the first half of 2020, compared to $481 million spent in all of 2019 for 125 deals. This year is on track to rival 2018’s $1.9 billion total spent on acquisitions in the crypto space. The acquisitions for the first half of this year were driven by an increase in transactions involving crypto exchanges and trading infrastructure, and native crypto companies continue to be the most active purchasers in the space.      Brainiacs A relic from Bitcoin’s early days, a “brainwallet” refers to a private key that is stored in the user’s memory either in the form of a seed phrase or a password, essentially giving you a portable “bank account” locked inside your head. Once you have the private key memorized, the rationale goes, you can access your bitcoin wallet from anywhere in the world, as long as you have internet access. Since brainwallets rely on the user remembering a passphrase, there is always the risk that you’ll forget it or, in the case of a user-generated phrase, that it will be easily guessed.      Broker deal Security token firm Securitize is trying to become a broker-dealer (meaning it's able to buy and sell securities) and alternative trading system for digital assets, the company announced Thursday. The firm signed an agreement to purchase Distributed Technology Markets (DTM), a broker-dealer and alternative trading system registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). As part of the acquisition, Securitize will also acquire Velocity Platform, a money services business with licenses in several states. The deal is pending regulatory approval and the terms of the deal were not disclosed.      Wrapped bitcoin Token investment platform CoinList minted a total of $57.1 million worth of wrapped bitcoin (4,997 WBTC) in back-to-back mints for its customers Wednesday, setting an all-time record for the most bitcoins wrapped by one merchant in a single day. The previous daily record was set on Sept. 18 when Alameda Research minted $44.7 million (4,093 WBTC) in three separate mints, according to transaction data analyzed by CoinDesk. CoinList is responsible for over 30% of all WBTC ever minted. As of Wednesday there were 105,132 WBTC in circulation, according to the project’s website, representing more than 17,000% growth year to date.

Speaking Wednesday during invest: ethereum economy, Heath Tarbert, chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, made comments suggestive of the agency’s support of green tech.      While “impressed” by Ethereum’s financial and technological capabilities, Tarbert said the network boasts environmental benefits (at least in comparison with Bitcoin).      “There are issues with mining, of course, so number one [is] environmental issues,” he said in a conversation with Chief Content Officer Michael Casey. “And so I think we were generally supportive as a larger matter in reducing … the environmental footprint, and moving to proof-of-stake [PoS] clearly does that.”      This line of thought is a continuation of a greener financial system the CFTC is looking to foster, as noted in a brief dated Sept. 9. The CFTC’s report details the growing threat of climate change and the steps needed to manage these risks. It also introduces the Climate-Related Market Risk subcommittee.      “Climate change poses a major risk to the stability of the U.S. financial system and to its ability to sustain the American economy [and] may also exacerbate financial system vulnerability that have little to do with climate change; including vulnerabilities caused by a pandemic that has stressed balance sheets, strained government budgets, and depleted household wealth,” the press release reads.      While the agency does not explicitly cite cryptocurrency or blockchain technology or any specific financial technologies, the agency is pledged to “accelerate the net-zero transition.”      “Policymakers, regulators and stakeholders can begin the process of taking thoughtful and intentional steps toward building a climate-resilient financial system that prepares our country for the decades to come,” CFTC Commissioner Rostin Behnam said in the press release.      Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization, is in the process of shifting to a new PoS consensus model. Nominatively, the shift is designed to help improve the network’s throughput.      Though other speakers throughout the virtual invest conference also noted PoS’ lowered energy consumption. This includes Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, who mentioned several times the lower energy requirements of PoS.      That said, Buterin did not indicate when Ethereum will be ready to make the shift. Phase 0, involving an independent beacon chain as a proving ground, will happen “very soon,” he said.      “At some point we’ve got to move in terms of scale and efficiency to deal with environmental issues but also to deal with the cost issue,” Tarbert said. “I see proof-of-stake as being potentially helpful.”    Who won #CryptoTwitter?",POSITIVE,BTC | FIL,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FIL | SPONSORED,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/15/blockchain-bites-filecoins-mainnet-mas-upswing-tarberts-environmental-concerns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9b3863bbe28652b19b2bf9c8eecd423489c2c17a-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405201,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLbsy,1602774109,China’s Digital Yuan Blurs the Lines Between CBDCs and Crypto,"Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are rapidly gaining prominence in discussions around the future of money. The many dimensions of debate, whether policy, economic or financial, whittle down ultimately to design choices.      With CBDC experiments in various stages of development globally, the norms of design are still being explored. It is in this environment that the Chinese digital yuan is readying for launch.    Tanvi Ratna is the founder and CEO of Policy 4.0, a research and advisory body working on new policy approaches for digital assets. She has conducted policy work for decision makers including India's prime minister, the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee and several ministries and state governments in India.    China’s digital yuan, or DC/EP, is not just important from the perspective of geopolitics and its implications for the current underpinnings of the global financial system. What is arguably as significant is the technical design of this system – the first production-scale retail CBDC system in the world.      As a result, the design choices of the DC/EP system are of high interest for the many central banks working on CBDCs. And as we discuss here, these design choices are also significant for the blockchain industry as a whole.      See also: China’s Blockchain Infrastructure Launches Website for Global Devs      Our team of blockchain engineers, economists, financial sector and policy experts at Policy 4.0 has spent some months reverse engineering and studying the implications of this system. What is evident in the DC/EP’s design is that China has pioneered technological processes that will revolutionize monetary and financial functions. Our overall findings will be launched soon in a detailed report series, and one highly significant conclusion is in the surprising similarities between the architecture of the DC/EP and cryptocurrencies.      This is in wide divergence to many of the other deliberations we see around the world on CBDC design, where there is a clear demarcation between the world of cryptocurrencies and central bank issued money. This is even more significant since China is seen as being closed to cryptocurrencies and it is known the DC/EP system is not entirely blockchain-based.      However, our findings on the design of the DC/EP make it clear the Chinese government has been paying close attention to the technical capabilities of cryptocurrencies. I highlight below some such similarities.    First similarity    The first clear similarity is the use of both online and hardware wallets. Cryptocurrencies have hardware wallets to securely store private keys off-chain. Similarly, in the design of the DC/EP system, there is a unique feature of hardware chip-card wallets. The chip card functionality allows users to transfer digital yuan from their bank accounts or mobile wallets into an offline chip card. Users can use these chip cards to pay merchants at a range of PoS-like terminals.    China has pioneered technological processes that will revolutionize monetary and financial functions.    While fiat to crypto conversion is restricted and regulated to various degrees globally, the legal tender status of the DC/EP enables another powerful suite of features for hardware wallets – seamless cash conversion. Citizens can convert cash to offline chip-card DC/EP deposits or get cash from chip-card DC/EP deposits using a range of ATM-like terminals. Linking the DC/EP closely to such existing models of digital payments will greatly enable adoption. The adoption dimension is clearly thought through and innovative, as we have examined in a recent blog post.    Second    A second similarity between the DCEP design and cryptocurrency is the use of two-key architecture to secure transactions. Cryptocurrency architecture leverages users’ public addresses and private keys to secure transactions.      In a twist to this common practice, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has enabled a unique secure transaction signing system. For some transactions, users have the option to secure and encrypt transaction data by co-signing it along with the user who is a counter-party to the transaction, or the bank. This effectively seals off the transaction data from being read by parties outside the transaction, such as service providers, adding greatly to the security in the system in case of any data breaches. However, the privacy dimension of transactions, such as shielding information from banks and regulators, is managed differently and is discussed in the reports.    Third    Another significant dimension of similarity is one more under-explored feature in the CBDC world – programmability. Cryptocurrencies manage to provide more features than fiat money because of the many degrees of programmability they leverage. For the first time in any CBDC design to date, the DC/EP leverages programmability extensively.      See also: Nearly 2 Million Sign Up for China’s Digital Yuan ‘Lottery’      The PBoC has created a unique data structure for the DC/EP notes (more accurately, strings). There is a welldefined lifecycle to the DC/EP notes from their generation to decommissioning. From the time of issuance, there are certain programmable components embedded in the data structure of the notes. There are also multiple levels of users within the digital currency system of the DC/EP. For each level of user, there are certain programmable functions enabled for DC/EP usage. These and many more technical dimensions of the digital yuan architecture are examined in depth in our reports.      The architecture of the digital yuan could spur central banks all over the world into leveraging similar features.

42405208,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLbys,1602774044,Immutable Calls: AP Election 2020 Results Will Be Recorded on a Blockchain,"The Associated Press’s (AP) 2020 election results will be recorded on a blockchain database, a first for the nearly 200-year-old news agency.      Announced Thursday, the collaboration between the not-for-profit wire service and the Everipedia tech startup will see more than 7,000 state and national election race calls recorded on a blockchain, with a publicly accessible user interface displaying the results. Everipedia’s database runs on top of EOS, the 14th-largest blockchain network by market cap, according to Nomics, though the race calls themselves will be recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.      Chainlink was chosen as the intermediary between the AP data and Everipedia, according to a press release.      Everipedia will publish the final results declared by AP after sufficient votes are counted, said Dwayne Desaulniers, the news organization’s director of enterprise, environmental, social and governance and data licensing.      “For us this is different and very interesting,” he said. “We’re watching very closely to see how our work can be applied to this media. Everipedia has been good to work with, a solid partnership. We do the race calls, they do the technical stuff.”      The AP will call the presidential, Senate, House of Representatives, state and local elections, in a process that could take anywhere from a few hours to days depending on how results are reported by election officials, Desaulniers told CoinDesk in a phone call.      “We’ll watch the data and whenever we see enough data that’s complete, that factors in all the mail-in [ballots] and all of the votes. Whenever our race callers then decide to declare a winner they’ll do so,” he said. “Most of them will be on election night … We’re ready to make really great race calls whenever the data and rules tell us that we’re good.”      Everipedia, a sort of decentralized alternative to Wikipedia with its own token, will be recording the results for posterity, said Sam Kazemian, the project’s president and co-founder. It launched its mainnet on top of the EOS blockchain in 2018.      While this is the first time AP’s election results will be recorded on a blockchain, the company has worked with other blockchain initiatives in the past. AP tried to license articles with now-defunct blockchain startup Civil in 2018.    Election day    Roughly 4,000 AP employees will be deployed across the U.S. on Election Day, working from polling centers, city halls and clerk’s offices around the country. As precincts begin reporting numbers, these employees will start recording the vote results in an internal system, updating as new numbers roll in.      The proprietary system will compare the results with similar data from two, four and six years ago in an effort to prevent any major errors from creeping through, Desaulniers said.      This data will, in turn, go to race callers, individuals who are familiar with the politics of the region they are in. (Desaulniers is a race caller for the U.S. state of New Hampshire.) These individuals compare current data with historic data and internal models that AP builds to declare if and when certain races are won.      “It’s very intense,” he said. “I think it's the biggest journalistic enterprise that we’re aware of.”      Everipedia takes over the process at this point. Once a race is called, that information is entered into another internal AP system. Everipedia will pull the final declaration from an API and record it on its own ledger, permanently storing what AP sees as the final result.      “So when we declare a governor has won, Everipedia will get that data immediately from our systems and they’ll be able to publish that,” he explained.      What Everipedia will not record are the vote totals; while most races will be called on Nov. 3, not every race will be. Those that are too close to call or which may end up going to a recount will not be called, Desaulniers said.      On top of the normal races that are tight and require time to call, 2020 has a massive number of voters who are using mail-in ballots so they can avoid large crowds during the coronavirus pandemic, which might make it difficult for precincts to report voting numbers quickly.      As of Oct. 14, 13.2 million absentee ballots have been returned with a further 68.6 million yet to be returned, according to the New York Times.      “This is sort of an extraordinary year,” Desaulniers said. “There’s no one system, one set of rules. Some states will only begin counting the early votes on election night, and therefore in some counties, in some races, it will extend into Wednesday and possibly later.”      For AP and Everipedia, this means the running list of races called will be continuously updated past Election Day itself.    Trusted systems    In Kazemian’s view, working with AP is a matter of trust.      The organization is a non-governmental, unbiased arbiter with close to two centuries’ worth of history, and has earned its reputation, he said.      It’s a different approach from projects that hope to solve the problem of figuring out which sources to trust by creating a system wherein token holders vote on what the “truth” is for a given story.      “This is one of those times where I'm super pro-blockchain but, like, it might probably be better to actually trust the centralized organization that's professionally done this for over 100 years right. This is a good example of that,” he said.      This lets Everipedia focus on making the data easily accessible on-chain and publicly readable, he said. In this collaboration, Everipedia will handle all aspects of storing the data on its EOS-based network.      The 2020 election is a sort of proving ground. Kazemian envisions other efforts with different news and media organizations.      Storing AP’s race calls on its network can be beneficial for prediction markets or “futures-defined products” that are focused on the election, he said.      These markets might be looking for a specific result at a specific time, but it is likely that the projected winner of the election might change depending on how mail-in ballots are counted and when the full results roll in, Kazemian said.      Read more: Prediction Markets’ Time Has Come, but They Aren’t Ready for It      “It allows people to build prediction markets that resolve around what a verified organization says or reports or ... allows people to vote or reward or create smart contracts, autonomous systems around whatever information is being put on-chain,” he said.      In a statement, Chainlink head of business development Daniel Kochis noted that the process would result in a ""verifiable, tamper-proof record"" for tracking the election.      Kazemian noted the uncertainty around this year’s election timing, where President Donald Trump might appear to be in the lead as in-person votes are counted, but Democratic challenger and former Vice President Joe Biden may be declared the winner after the mail-in ballots and early votes are counted, as one scenario.

42405204,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLbuw,1602773705,Filecoin Launch Finally Brings $200M ICO to Fruition,"The Filecoin network pivoted to mainnet at block 148,888, or approximately 14:44 UTC. With that, its FIL tokens will begin their distribution.      Filecoin is a system from Protocol Labs meant to be both a decentralized file storage and content distribution network in one. The Filecoin team wrote in a post announcing the transition the block number for mainnet launch signifies ""prosperity for life"" in Chinese, chosen ""to honor the epic contribution by our Chinese mining community to Filecoin's long-term success.""      The new token is very likely to make history as the fastest newly live blockchain to reach a market capitalization of over $1 billion, though we can't really know until the FIL tokens enter trading.      It should be noted the tokens distributed today will basically all be subject to a vesting schedule, so only a very small portion of the total supply of 2 billion FIL in the Filecoin system would count as circulating. Block explorers currently show a circulating supply of 10,396,586 as of 14:45 UTC. FIL futures are trading at $55.63 according to Crypto.com right now, which would place the market cap at $578 million.      The circulating supply at launch should be much, much smaller than the 200 million tokens sold in the 2017 initial coin offering (ICO), making for a vastly smaller market capitalization by convention.      Read more: Filecoin: Understanding the Complex Crypto System Meant to Rival AWS      Despite multiple delays, the Filecoin project has attracted considerable attention, particularly in China where investors have been speculating heavily on the network's mining hardware and the FIL token.    CoinList leads    CoinList's Scott Keto contends the first market to actually have FIL tokens available for purchase will likely be CoinList Pro.      The launch of Filecoin is itself a milestone for CoinList, a company that was spun out from Naval Ravikant's AngelList to manage the gigantic token sale for Filecoin, closing in September 2017. The token sale ultimately raised over $200 million, the largest ICO to that point.      Read more: Filecoin Is Mailing Out Hard Drives of Climate Data to Kick-Start Its File-Storage Network      ""This was one of the most anticipated launches or token sales in 2017, it took them a long time to go live, I think that's partly because they took their responsibility really seriously,"" Keto told CoinDesk in a phone call. ""It's finally here and it's one of the few, in my personal opinion, one of the very clear use cases for blockchain.""      Those interested in following along with Filecoin in its earliest day should first keep an eye on one of its block explorers. Filfox is one such explorer: It shows block height, the number of miners, the top miners on the network and the total amount of available storage on the network. Filscan is another.      ""There are many folks already announced as early Filecoin users, and still more to come next week,"" Filecoin's Ian Darrow told CoinDesk via email.    Filecoin dapps    Of announced projects, one example is Slate, a personal storage service that uses Filecoin and IPFS. Textile is another, which has evolved into a set of developer tools for managing storage from where it started, as a sort of decentralized Flickr.      In last month's ""Space Race"" testnet sprint, 360 miners participated globally, increasing the network's data capacity by 230 pebibytes. There was a final prize pool of 1.5 million FIL.      Read more: Filecoin: Understanding the Complex Crypto System Meant to Rival AWS    Ecosystem    CoinList is playing a key role in the distribution of FIL tokens today, managing 55% of the distribution, for all the ICO participants who did not indicate a self-custody or external solution for the distribution, Keto explained.      ""Given that CoinList will have the majority of the initial supply, in all likelihood CoinList Pro will be first to list. Fake IOU platforms may try to be first, but those are not backed by real tokens,"" Keto wrote.      CoinList's custody partner is Gemini Custody, though individual FIL buyers are using solutions at Coinbase, Anchorage and others.      Multiple exchanges have promised to list the FIL token, as Decrypt reported Wednesday. CoinList said that number is likely to rise.      Keto estimated that around 3,500 entities will receive FIL tokens. There were a little over 3,000 in the ICO and several hundred more that came through the incentivized testnet. Keto said that, anecdotally, there has been a stunning amount of inbound interest for buying FIL leading up to the mainnet launch.      This launch marks the latest in a string of products going live as described from the highest quality ICOs, a trend that arguably started when the Brave browser first started feeding ads to users last year.      Filecoin's purpose is to store real data in safe and complex ways. It's still incentivizing technical entities to get in early. It's currently running a contest for storing real data, called Slingshot, that will remain live for the next several days.      While the ICO era was controversial for its large number of scams, the best-known token sales have largely delivered their promised products (see for example Status, Tezos, Bancor and EOS).

The codebase for the smart-contract upgrade to Bitcoin’s blockchain has been merged into the Bitcoin Core library. This comes about a month after Pieter Wuille created a pull request to merge the feature.  Now that Taproot’s code has been included in Bitcoin Core’s coding library, the upgrade is only waiting to be deployed at this point. For the new upgrade to activate network-wide, node operators must adopt Taproot's new ruleset in place of the older code's consensus rules.  This could take weeks or months, depending on how the review process unfolds for the two leading implementation proposals.  One of these deployment triggers, BIP 8, would create a “signaling” period to allow full and mining nodes to upgrade; after this period is over, an automatic activation would take place for those who haven’t upgraded.  The other method, Matt Corallo's modern soft-fork activation, is somewhat similar in that it includes a year-long signaling period but it also includes a six-month review process after activation (as well as the added contingency of a two-year activation method not unlike BIP 8 if the first method fails).  In the works since Gregory Maxwell proposed Taproot in the first month of 2018, the upgrade is perhaps the most anticipated soft-fork in Bitcoin since Segwit was activated in 2016.  Taproot would implement Schnorr signatures into Bitcoin, a cryptographic technique for signing transactions that would enable Bitcoin with more flexible (and private) smart contracts.  Many developers anticipate Taproot will be much less controversial than Segwit and thus will activate faster, though an exact timeline for deployment is not solidified.

So it’s not surprising the DeFi craze would find its way to China, which has an active cryptocurrency community despite government restrictions on trading and token sales.      Chinese startups are playing a crucial role in the DeFi boom with highly localized and nimble adaptations of western projects as well as a marketing apparatus that is laser-focused on Chinese crypto communities, industry watchers say.      From July through the middle of October, the number of searches for DeFi has soared on China's social media platform WeChat. It has almost doubled during this period of time, according to WeChat Index, a data analysis tool that includes keyword searches, articles and forwards in WeChat moments.      Major Defi projects, such as NEST, DForce and YFII, all with huge Chinese followings, have raised millions of dollars in the span of a few weeks and topped the TVL ranking on DeFi Pulse.    Not just copycats    China often has a reputation for adapting western products to local markets, or in some cases mimicking them. Compound alleged China-based DForce “stole” its code and Chinese liquidity mining site YFII cloned another foreign-based project, Yearn.Finance (YFI).      “Admittedly, many Chinese projects copy code from western DeFi pioneers such as the liquidity leader Yearn.Finance and decentralized exchange UniSwap,” Nervos’ Lü said. “However, Chinese companies are making innovations in localizing the original products and that is what makes DeFi products more popular in the country.”      DeFi-friendly crypto wallets, centralized exchanges’ financing schemes for retail investors and targeted marketing strategies are among the localized products and services that Chinese startups have created to pave the way for DeFi inside the country.      Chinese DeFi startups reach many crypto investors through wallets.      “Not many people know how to use DeFi applications directly given its complex technical features and financial schemes,” Lü said. “However, many Chinese crypto wallets simplify and optimize processes for users to participate in DeFi projects.”      Hangzhou-based imToken, for example, is one of the most popular mobile wallets in China. It has a built-in decentralized exchange (DEX), Tokenlon, enabling its users to trade tokens from different dapps on Ethereum, EOS and TRON within the wallet.      While the wallet is natively integrated with blockchain protocol Kyber, the in-wallet DEX is built on top of the code from another DeFi project 0x. Founded in 2016, imToken secured $10 million through a Series A round led by IDG Capital two years ago.      While some U.S. counterparts may also provide similar services, such wallets have emerged to be one of the major channels for Chinese investors to participate in DeFi, Lü said      Trading costs are another hurdle for retail investors to participate in DeFi. As most DeFi dapps run on Ethereum, transaction fees on the blockchain have become prohibitively high for smaller investors.      Centralized exchanges, which are major players behind the Chinese DeFi scene, have a solution for that, said Jason Wu, CEO of decentralized crypto lending startup DeFiner.      “Centralized exchanges are pooling money from retail inventors to invest in DeFi so that millions of Chinese smaller investors can afford the high gas fees in the projects,” Wu said. In turn, these centralized exchanges increase trading volume and earn more fees by listing and trading the native governance tokens of such DeFi projects on their platform.    Spreading the word    Community building and marketing strategies are crucial to the success of a DeFi project. In China, key opinion leaders (KOLs), in-person meetups and online Ask Me Anything (AMA) gatherings are all key parts of the crypto marketing apparatus, Jason Wu said.      “The crypto space, including DeFi, is very KOL-driven,” said Sharlyn Wu, chief investment officer at Huobi DeFi Labs. “For a new project coming to the market, you need a number of KOL to support it and the KOL will influence a bigger group of audience to get into the projects.”      Many of the KOLs in China understand English, and they translate and process the western thought leaders’ content to inform the Chinese crypto community, according to Jason Wu.      There are three tiers of KOLs, says Sharlyn Wu. “The KOLs in tier 1 dig into white papers, code and the formula of economic models and the tier 2 KOLs basically translate to the Chinese community. Tier 3 KOLs are the ones who move things to the border retail market.”      These Chinese influencers tend to be researchers, venture capitalists and crypto journalists, Sharlyn Wu said.      Now, in-person meetings and conferences are coming back as China appears to have contained the spread of coronavirus. DeFi-themed gatherings have increased recently in China, Jason Wu said.      “Last week, I attended three conferences across three Chinese cities. Some of the conferences held more than 1,000 participants,” said Jason Wu, who has launched his own DeFi project recently. “There are retail investors, but most people there are business development managers from centralized exchanges, DeFi startups and crypto media members.”      Wu said Chinese KOLs tend not to use Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, as their main social platform. He noted there are many limitations on topics you can post about, such as direct trading between fiat and cryptocurrencies.      WeChat is also where most online meetings take place in the crypto community. Through Ask Me Anythings (AMAs), crypto investors ask Chinese KOLs about new DeFi products and the latest industry trends.      According to Jason Wu, Chinese crypto media also plays an important role in informing people of new DeFi projects, in addition to organizing conferences. They tend to focus on the technical side of the crypto business since the Chinese central bank restricts the promotion of crypto trading.    Deep pockets    “Capital in crypto is always on the lookout for returns, and DeFi has offered a great opportunity.” Lü said. “When liquidity mining took off earlier this year, the capital started not only flowing into but concentrated in the DeFi space.”      The capital that backs Chinese DeFi projects might not come from new capital but two existing forces that have existed in the Chinese crypto industry for a long time, he said.      On the one hand are the industrialists who have invested in infrastructure and ecosystem, who share dividends as the whole space grows, he says. On the other are institutional investors that tend to be more speculative and prioritize short-term gains.      China’s deep pockets in crypto can be traced back to its crypto mining industry with miner maker giants such as Bitmain and MicroBT.      China-originated centralized exchanges such as Huobi, KuCoin and Binance have also been a driving force behind many crypto crazes in China.      However, helping DEX upstarts could become a problem for China-originated centralized exchanges such as Binance. In a recent interview with CoinDesk, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said centralized exchanges might have to share the crypto trading market with DEXs.      Binance, Huobi and Kucoin, three exchange giants birthed in China, have made efforts to get into the DeFi space. Binance recently rolled out its patented blockchain, where developers can build DeFi applications on the platform, while Huobi launched DeFi Labs to back DeFi hopefuls. All three exchanges have listed DeFi assets such as governance tokens for trading.      The first wave that hit China’s DeFi scene is casino-style gambling, Sharlyn Wu said, noting there has been too much speculation in the market. But this could change. And China may not always be in the position of following the West.      “Even though Asia was initially behind in the first wave of the DeFi from the U.S., I think developers in China will lead DeFi the way they have led CeFi,” Sharlyn Wu said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/15/how-the-defi-craze-made-its-way-to-china,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a968b90a412a71c13dca792bc52176d6e39d53c1-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

NYDFS Superintendent Linda A. Lacewell announced the department's first-ever ""TechSprint"" collaborative initiative in a press statement on Thursday.  The initiative seeks solutions for digital reporting that would give the regulator ""instant access"" to data from firms under its supervision.  ""The future of financial supervision is digital and needs to happen now,"" according to Lacewell.  DFS is making ""progress towards automating the reporting"" of financial data via the department's regulated entities, she said.  The move comes amid a growing trend by financial regulators around the globe to employ ""TechSprints"" as a tool to prototype technical solutions to regulatory issues, per the announcement.  ""Virtual currency companies"" were chosen first for the New York scheme due to their ""advanced digital capabilities.""  NYDFS also notes that, given that legacy reporting formats are often slow, periodic and laborious, data quality issues arise.  The department will collaborate with the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, an organization of state financial regulators, and the Alliance for Innovative Regulation to launch the TechSprint.  Over a number of days, fintech professionals, regulators and experts working on regulatory compliance solutions will come together to propose solutions.  Those solutions could range from improvements to processes through to a functioning prototype of a reporting mechanism.  The end result will see a set of common standards hammered out to be provided in an open-source technical framework and later adopted by the DFS and potentially other regulators.  Design workshops are slated for the fourth financial quarter of this year with the TechSprint expected to occur in early 2021.

Announced Thursday, Block.one has released “EOSIO for Business,” an enterprise-focused version of its software featuring Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS), consulting, technical support and training and certification programs, the company said.      Blockchain cloud services can offer businesses a quick and painless way to spin up digital ledgers on their preferred cloud computing platforms.      “Despite knowing the inherent benefits that blockchain will deliver to their business operations, many in-house product engineering teams are wary of the complexity involved in setting up and administering their own blockchain,” said Block.one Chief Operating Officer Ted Cahall in a statement.      It’s commonplace for enterprise blockchains to team up with cloud providers; Ethereum-based Quorum’s long association with Microsoft Azure is a good example. While Block.one was buoyed by recent news about Google Cloud joining EOS and providing infrastructure support, the enterprise BaaS offering will be using Amazon Web Services, a Block.one spokesperson confirmed.

However, the enterprise space appears to be pastures green as far as the EOSIO software community is concerned. While the public EOS blockchain has been beset by governance issues, EOSIO programmers in places like Costa Rica and Argentina are focused on established businesses. For example, EOS Costa Rica beat off competition from the likes of Hyperledger to win a blockchain deal with global accountancy firm Grant Thornton back in May of this year.      Over the summer, LatamLink, the EOSIO Latin American contingency, fielded an audacious bid to provide blockchain support to LACChain, a blockchain framework that has the backing of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and a host of public and private entities across Latin America and the Caribbean.

42405229,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLc5l,1602766173,"First Mover: As Ethereum Enthusiasm Builds, 'Bear Case' Could Still See Prices Double","Cryptocurrency markets are sending strong signals right now that the innovations coming from fast-emerging technologies like decentralized finance, or DeFi, could shake up the global order of banks and money managers and insurance companies.      A recurring theme at CoinDesk's invest: ethereum economy virtual conference Wednesday was just how much money there is to be made in the fast-growing digital-asset industry.      Talk of returns and yields was salted throughout the technical discussions of protocols and governance systems and blockchain arcana like ""layer 1"" and ""layer 2"" and ""rollups"" and ""shards.""      Even traditional-market regulators are starting to acknowledge the growth possibilities that cryptocurrency bulls have been betting on for years.      The technological movement is ""obviously revolutionary, and I think at the end of the day could lead to a massive disintermediation of the financial system and the traditional players,” Heath Tarbert, chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, told CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey. (Link here to the video interview.)      DeFi, in which developers are using open-source software to create semi-automated lending and trading systems atop blockchain networks, proved its potential in recent months as projects like Compound and Uniswap attracted billions of dollars of crypto collateral. A series of ""yield farming"" projects such as Yearn.Finance have made it easy to rack up extra token rewards, a way of juicing fixed-income returns in digital-asset markets.      The crypto industry appears to have emerged from its larval phase into the pupal: The form is taking shape, but coming-of-age challenges are yet to be overcome, from reliability to marketing and, of course, scaling to the point where millions of users can be accommodated.      There are steep risks, as with the past few months' flameouts of DeFi projects like SushiSwap, whose founder suddenly decided to cash out tokens at the top of the market, crashing the market, and Yam, which succumbed to a bug.      ""In many cases you can risk permanent loss of your capital by participating in some of these activities,"" Ryan Watkins, a senior research analyst at Messari, said on one of the panels.      And it's premature to compare the scale of cryptocurrencies to the traditional financial system.      “Today, 99.9% of the money is still in fiat,” Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao said in a one-on-one session with journalist Leigh Cuen during the CoinDesk conference. “We still need gateways.”      Those, too, are starting to emerge. Bloq, a blockchain infrastructure firm led by former CNN.com web developer Jeff Garzik, is rolling out a product that allows users to earn money by buying customized ""holding pools"" of digital assets, CoinDesk's Jaspreet Kalra reported Wednesday.      ""The future is dynamic portfolios that are expensive to construct in traditional finance,"" said Tarun Chitra, CEO of Gauntlet, a simulation platform for crypto networks. His Zoom feed was the most colorful by far:      Another company, Blox, plans to help customers pool ether (ETH) to get past a threshold needed to ""stake"" on the Ethereum blockchain. Staking is similar to holding an interest-bearing deposit and will go live with a major upgrade purportedly to arrive by the end of 2020.      But annual returns could range from 4.6% to 10.3%, CoinDesk's Sebastian Sinclair wrote. Compare that with the 0.01% offered on a JPMorgan Chase savings account.      In one of the panels at the conference, David Hoffman, founding father of the DeFi-focused publication Bankless, mapped out the bullish case for ether and said prices could climb to $10,000 or higher, from about $380 now.      In a subsequent session, Vishal Shah, founder and CEO of the crypto derivatives exchange Alpha5, mapped out the bearish case but concluded by saying prices could double under that scenario.      Ether prices have already tripled this year. The lofty valuations might just be hype. Or they might be a sign that cryptocurrency traders are looking ahead to the industry's maturation.    Bitcoin Watch    The bitcoin market has turned indecisive, according to Wednesday's doji candle.      Key indicators like the 14-day relative strength index remain biased bullish. Additionally, the five- and 10-day averages continue to trend north, indicating the path of least resistance is to the higher side.      From the macro perspective, the rising stockpile of the global negative-yielding debt is a major bullish development for perceived inflation-hedges or store of value assets like bitcoin. ""Going forward, the search for yield is likely to be a major driver of growth in bitcoins price and adoption,"" Stack Fund's CEO Matthew Dibb told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat.      Further, recent disclosures of bitcoin holdings by payments company Square and Stone Ridge Asset Management has validated the cryptocurrency's appeal as an alternative investment.      As such, odds appear stacked in favor of a continued bull run. That said, in the short run the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to sell-offs in the global equity markets.

The firm signed an agreement to purchase Distributed Technology Markets (DTM), a broker-dealer and alternative trading system registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).      As part of the acquisition, Securitize will also acquire Velocity Platform, a money services business with licenses in several states. Both DTM and Velocity Platform are owned by parent company Velocity Markets. Securitize added these registrations to its status as a SEC-registered transfer agent in the digital asset space.      The deal is pending regulatory approval and the terms of the deal were not disclosed.      “We felt that an acquisition was the faster route with less uncertainty,” said Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo. “This will allow us to create a marketplace for secondary trading of private securities.”      Read more: Securitize Is Taking Ethereum-Based Securities Into the DeFi Realm      Broker-dealers in the U.S are able to buy and sell securities, both for themselves and for their clients, while alternative trading systems facilitate the trades. In 2019, FINRA sat on dozens of broker-dealer applications for months, reportedly at the SEC’s request.      For a while, Securitize had assumed it wouldn’t have to create its own marketplace for security tokens because of how many companies planned to become broker-dealers for the space, Domingo said.      Securitize has spoken with at least 40 companies in the security token space who have folded or not launched their projects because a lack of understanding of the sector’s regulatory complexity, he added.      Prior to the acquisition, Securitize was using security token trading platform Openfinance as its ATS, but in April the company threatened to delist tokens and suspend trading unless issuers could cover more costs.      “There’s no reason to believe that someone else is going to be able to create an effective secondary marketplace [for security tokens],” Domingo said.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/15/securitize-goes-license-shopping-with-acquisition-of-sec-registered-broker-dealer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/982573b7f8da50f077bc68799f4eb49293316a84-2000x1335.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405216,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLc3n,1602762821,The Inevitability of 'Big Blockchain',"The U.S. economy is less dynamic than it was two decades ago, and with this shift has come massive concentration in market power and control.      Industrial concentration has risen. More workers than ever work for very large firms. A handful of major investors own a greater percentage of public companies. Fewer companies (and individuals) decide what we consume, where we work, how much we earn and even how our government is run than they have in the last half century.    Stephanie Hurder, a CoinDesk columnist, is a founding economist at Prysm Group, an economic advisory focused on the implementation of emerging technologies, and an academic contributor to the World Economic Forum. She has a Ph.D. in Business Economics from Harvard. This column is part of CoinDesk's Internet 2030 series.    Blockchain advocates support the technology as a means by which to mitigate this ever increasing concentration of power. On their face, products and features such as decentralized governance, personal data management apps and DeFi offerings promise to disrupt monopolies and redistribute control of valuable assets to the people. Blockchain, they say, is the antidote to the monopolistic (and monopsonistic) tendencies of the modern economy.      This is a tempting promise, but like many ""silver bullet"" solutions, it is not as foolproof as it initially appears.      Blockchain applications currently do not wield economic and political power as brazenly as major tech companies because they have yet to achieve any comparable user base. Large-scale adoption (and the accompanying attention and money) is a prerequisite for accumulating power. It took decades for the World Wide Web to evolve from the decentralized invention of Tim Berners-Lee to the basis of massively profitable and powerful social media apps such as Facebook and Twitter.      The essential question is, therefore, whether, if and when blockchain finds its own killer apps that those services will be meaningfully more decentralized than the current options. And the answer is – unless the blockchain industry proactively works to prevent it – probably not. There’s a good chance that in a decade or two we’ll be complaining about the evil nature of “Big Blockchain” in the same way we complain about Big Tech today.    There’s a good chance that in a decade or two, we’ll be complaining about the evil nature of 'Big Blockchain' in the same way we complain about Big Tech today.    Blockchain already exhibits early evidence of the same economic forces that have driven consolidation in the broader economy. Ethereum’s first-mover advantage means it has yet to be unseated as the most popular protocol to build on, despite fervent attempts from competitors. Bitcoin Proof-of-Work mining rewards feed a “rich get richer” dynamic, with block rewards awarded to the equivalent of only 10 addresses. Stablecoins – one of the most promising use cases – have powerful network effects that encourage winner-take-all market dynamics. Regulation, both nationally and internationally, is limited and totally unequipped to take on problems regarding antitrust, market power and other related issues.      But won’t decentralized governance prevent consolidation? Not necessarily. Modern tech companies have governance that is more decentralized than many people care to admit. All five companies that make up the acronym known as FAANG – Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet (once known as Google) – are publicly traded. Any individual who wishes can purchase Class A shares, which confer voting rights. Aside from Facebook, none of these companies has a single individual or entity with majority control. And yet, this distributed control and public participation has not prevented any of the problems that consumers and workers grapple with today.      The modern economy is still figuring out how to undo the damage done by allowing the internet – whose invention was funded by public money – to become dominated by a handful of private companies. To avoid a similar fate, those working in blockchain will need to make some major industry-wide investments over the next decade.      The critical question is thus: In 10 years, what institutions or mechanisms will prevent Vanguard from accumulating voting power by buying up governance tokens – or whatever other mechanism is in place at the time – in exactly the same way it has done with stock?      See also: Vitalik Buterin: Blockchains Will Discourage Monopolies, Not Create Them      At a minimum, blockchain founders and investors need to recognize that many of the fundamental economic forces that are driving consolidation across the economy will also apply to blockchain-based applications. Distributed ledgers are not immune to “winner takes all” market dynamics, the increased globalization of markets, and more lax regulation and weaker antitrust enforcement simply because they are distributed. Thinking deeply and realistically about the economic similarities between blockchain and other industries now will help the industry to anticipate potential problem areas.      Second, as I've discussed previously, blockchain presents a new environment that requires custom-designed decentralized governance. As of now, governance systems are far from ready to oversee complex, billion-dollar products. Hundreds of years of insights in economics, political science, law and business must be translated and adapted into collective decision-making processes suitable for blockchain and resistant to consolidation.      A massive influx of investment into developing this public knowledge – by government agencies, ecosystem funds and even individual protocols – has the potential to reap huge benefits to the entire industry in the next decade.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Stephanie Hurder,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/10/15/the-inevitability-of-big-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1a038095cebecfad102adbc797064b555ac887bd-1420x866.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42405213,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLc2o,1602762379,"World's Growing Stockpile of Negative-Yielding Debt a Positive for Bitcoin, Say Analysts","A global surge in negative-yielding bonds is likely to bolster bitcoin's appeal as an alternative investment over the long run, experts say.    The amount of global debt offering negative yields has more than doubled to $16.3 trillion in the past seven months to hit the highest level since April 2019, as noted by macro analyst Holger Zschaepitz.  In other words, currently, over $16 trillion in such bonds is guaranteed to incur losses if held till maturity.  With central banks buying bonds at a frantic pace to support the global economy, the tally of negative-yielding debt is heading toward a fresh record high above $17 trillion.  As such, the search for yield is likely to intensify, leading to increased rotation of money out of bonds and into perceived inflation hedges such as bitcoin, according to Stack Fund CEO Matthew Dibb.  ""Going forward, the search for yield is likely to be a major driver of growth in bitcoin's price and adoption,"" Dibb told CoinDesk .  So far stocks have been the major benefactor of negative-yielding bonds, he added.  Economist and trader Alex Kruger told CoinDesk he expects the soaring negative-yielding debt to reignite bitcoin's bull run once the uncertainty brought by the U.S. presidential election is out of the way.  The cryptocurrency has rallied by nearly 200% over the past seven months alongside the spike in the negative-yielding debt.  The period started with the ""Black Thursday"" markets crash on March 12. Year to date, bitcoin is up 58%.  The recent disclosures of bitcoin investments by companies like Stone Ridge Asset Management and payments company Square have boosted bitcoin's appeal as an alternative asset.  While the broader outlook is bullish, in the short term, the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to bouts of sell-off in the global equity markets.  At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $11,300, representing a 1% decline on the day. Prices clocked a high of $11,723 earlier this week.  Stock markets, too, have come under pressure this week due to the resurgence of coronavirus across Europe and deadlock in Washington over additional fiscal stimulus.

The guidance suggests that tokens offering profit, income or capital growth would be regulated as security-like investments and would require a financial services license.  These tokens would come under the same rules that would apply if the investment were made via other means such as share certificates.  Tokens or cryptocurrencies that offer a store of value or access to services and are not a form of e-money would be unregulated.  Calling the development a ""milestone,"" Steve Billinghurst, regulatory lead at Digital Isle of Man, said the guidance is likely to evolve further in line with the changing regulatory situation in other major jurisdictions.

According to reports by the NZHerald, the man, granted interim anonymity after he appeared at the Auckland District Court on Thursday, faces 30 charges in all.  He is alleged to have received thousands of New Zealand dollars to buy cryptocurrency as part of transactions intended for money laundering, per the reporting.  Other charges allege the man laundered funds via the purchase of high-end vehicles including NZ$421,000 (US$279,687) for a Lamborghini and around NZ$288,888 (US$191,919) for a Mercedes G63.  NZ$1.7 million (US$1.12 million) is claimed to have been used to launder money through a property in East Auckland.  He is further alleged to have laundered money received from an individual at Auckland Airport earlier this year, as well as obtaining over a million dollars from a bank using a false identity.  The charges come after an asset-seizure operation from the police dubbed ""Operation Brookings"" involving numerous officers and a number of search warrants.  In total, the operation netted seven high-end luxury vehicles and three properties worth an estimated $3.3 million (US$2.19 million) in total.

42405210,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLbxt,1602749779,Breitling Goes Live With Ethereum-Based System to Put All New Watches on the Blockchain,"The actual Breitling watch given to James Bond in the 1965 film “Thunderball” (it had a built-in Geiger counter) apparently wound up being sold at a car boot sale for £25 ($33). The collector’s piece was later auctioned at Christie’s for a cool $160,000.      Such mysterious circumstances could never befall a Breitling watch from today, however, thanks to the long, immutable reach of the blockchain.      Announced Tuesday, Breitling is the first luxury watchmaker to offer an Ethereum-based digital passport for all its new timepieces. The provenance-tracking effort was first debuted for one specific model earlier this year.      Expensive watches have always come with physical (and now electronic) certificates of authenticity and international warranty, but there needs to be a standardized way to transparently track the service history and any repairs to the watch, according to Antonio Carriero, Breitling’s chief digital and technology officer.      This requirement, Carriero said, is especially being driven by the burgeoning pre-owned watch market. In recent years, the market in pre-owned watches has grown to about $20 billion, roughly half the size of the new luxury watch market.      “So when you want to buy a watch from a [luxury pre-owned watch] platform, a key element is the full traceability of the product you are going to buy, the full transparency about the history of the product,” said Carriero. “Today there is no system that is unifying those capabilities.”    Breitling taps Arianee    Breitling has chosen to work with track-and-trace blockchain Arianee, which has connections to Swiss luxury brands group Richemont, the owner of Cartier, Dunhill, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Montblanc and others.      Arianee’s protocol uses a system on Ethereum involving so-called non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a way of watermarking an individual object, such as an expensive watch or even conferring individual authenticity on a digital work of art.      Read more: Fur Real? Businesses Test CryptoKitties-Inspired Ethereum Tech      Breitling wants the entire industry to work together, said Carriero, to build a global standard for digital certificates and an API that customers will benefit from instead of working in silos.      “Everything Breitling has developed to integrate Arianee with its e-warranty system is available for free to anyone who wants to use it,” he said.      Proof of authenticity is a novel and compelling use case for blockchain that stands apart from most enterprise uses of the tech, which are often about replacing some existing system. So it’s not surprising that when it comes to stamping provenance on luxury items, Arianee is not alone.      Back in March of last year luxury brand conglomerate LVMH, owner of the Louis Vuitton label, said it was preparing to launch a blockchain-based authenticity system (code-named AURA). The project involved ConsenSys and Microsoft Azure.
