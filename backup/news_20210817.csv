42376395,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6APy9,1629242022,Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari on Crypto Market: 'Thousands of Garbage Coins',"The Federal Reserve official who famously reassured the U.S. public last year that the central bank could inject unlimited money into the economy has voiced some well-worn, oft-rebutted criticisms of bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general.      ""I was more optimistic about crypto and bitcoin five or six years ago,"" Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said Tuesday. ""So far what I've seen is ... 95% fraud, hype, noise and confusion.""      During an appearance at the Pacific NorthWest Economic Region annual summit in Big Sky, Mont., Kashkari contrasted the open nature of the crypto field with the U.S. government's monopoly on issuance of dollars.      ""There is no barrier to you creating your own bitcoin, or me creating my own ... I'll call it Neelcoin,"" he said. Pointing to his on-stage interlocutor, Larry Simkins, CEO of conglomerate The Washington Companies, Kashkari added, ""and then Larry can create Larrycoin.""      Other Fed officials have expressed more nuanced and favorable assessments of digital assets. Vice Chairman Randal Quarles, for example, said in June the U.S. should find ways to ""say yes"" to stablecoins.      While it is true that anyone can spin up a digital asset easily, Kashkari did not mention the power of network effects, which make bitcoin more secure and valuable in the market's eyes than its many competitors.      ""There are thousands of these garbage coins that have been created,"" the central banker went on. ""Some of them are complete fraud Ponzi schemes. They dupe people into investing money and then the founders rip them off.""      This is indeed true very often. But Kashkari then made a sweeping generalization.      ""I always ask people what problem are you trying to solve and no one can articulate what the actual problem is,"" he asserted.      Kashkari scoffed at the idea that bitcoin could serve as a safe haven from inflation, particularly the kind seen in some developing countries. ""I don't see any evidence that the U.S. government or the United States of America is on a path to Venezuela,"" he said.      Some bitcoin users may find that line galling given Kashkari's interview on television's ""60 Minutes"" in 2020, early in the coronavirus pandemic, in which he boasted that ""there is no end to our ability"" at the Fed to pump money into the economy.      The Venezuela comment also elided the fact that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are global, and have been adopted by residents of countries suffering from more severe inflation than the U.S.      While he stopped short of saying crypto could never be useful (""it's certainly possible""), Kashkari indicated Tuesday he was skeptical of the prospects.      ""I've not seen any use case other than funding illicit activities like drugs and prostitution,"" he said, apparently unaware that bitcoin has been used by politically disfavored publishers and dissident voices to survive government blacklisting in countries like Russia.      ""I have not seen any use case that is legitimate so far that bitcoin solves,"" Kashkari said.      He closed his brief remarks on the subject by circling back to an audience member's question about the city of Miami's recent foray into crypto.      ""If you want to launch Montana Coin, don't let me stop you,"" Kashkari quipped.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/08/17/minneapolis-fed-president-kashkari-on-crypto-market-thousands-of-garbage-coins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00eed216f48cdddad0287fcf6902a8c8b934a3c1-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376394,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6APuN,1629240559,White Hats Just Defused a Potential $350M Heist on SushiSwap,"A group of people in the crypto community, led by crypto investment firm Paradigm’s research partner Sam Sun, may have just prevented SushiSwap’s token fundraising platform Miso from losing more than $350 million worth of ether, after discovering and fixing a bug on the platform in under just five hours.      Because of the collective efforts, SushiSwap says no funds have been lost.      According to a post published by SushiSwap on Monday, Sam Sun, and his colleagues Georgios Konstantopoulos and Daniel Robinson – all from San Francisco-based crypto investment firm Paradigm – reached out to the team at Sushi to alert them to “a vulnerability” on the “Dutch auction” contract on the Miso platform.      In a Dutch auction, investors place bids reflecting the maximum amount that they are willing to pay. Once the bids are collected, the highest bid is declared the winner. After the auction is finalized, unsuccessful bids are returned to their owners.    The vulnerability    The SushiSwap team and Paradigm’s Sun, in separate posts, both identified that, essentially, the vulnerability was centered around the ability to batch multiple calls to commitEth and reuse a single msg.value across every commitment, allowing an attacker to bid in the auction for free.      “Combining batch with commitEth (a function on Miso Dutch Auction) creates a two-pronged issue where a user can both put up a commitment higher than ‘msg.value’ thereby draining any unsold tokens and additionally drain the raised funds on the contract as refunds if the auction has reached max commitment,” SushiSwap’s team wrote in the post.      ""The bug was created when a convenience function for wallet addresses interacted with the refund mechanism of the auction contract,"" explained Duncan Townsend, CTO at Immunefi, a bug bounty platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) that was also recruited to help solve the issue.      ""Users could over-bid and get a refund of the difference between the current bid and the amount they submitted, but the refund could be repeated to drain the auction contract,"" Townsend added.      “All future planned auctions utilizing the specific Dutch auction contracts with ETH commitments have been paused until an updated version is redeployed,” SushiSwap’s team wrote.    The takeaway: Smart contracts are hard    At the conclusion of his blog post, Sun reflected that one of the most important lessons to be learned from this discovery is that even ""safe components can come together to make something unsafe.""      The smart contracts that underpin DeFi are complex, combining ""composable"" ""Lego blocks"" to create new contracts and protocols. But the manner in which these blocks are combined can have inadvertent, disastrous consequences, even when programmers are using inherently safe individual components.  ""This incident shows that even safe contract-level components can be mixed in a way that produces unsafe contract-level behavior. There’s no catch-all advice to apply here like 'check-effect-interaction,' so you just need to be cognizant of what additional interactions new components are introducing,"" Sun said.      The event took place just after the biggest DeFi exploit to date took place last week: Cross-chain DeFi site Poly Network was attacked, losing more than $600 million worth of cryptocurrencies, due to a bug.      In the case of the SushiSwap vulnerability, however, many in the crypto community have taken to social media to praise the five-hour collective rescue efforts led by the research arm at Paradigm.      ""Chad af,"" Twitter user @KadenZipfel wrote (a ""chad"" usually refers to an ""alpha male"" in the common parlance of internet slang).      “Absolute King,” another Twitter user, @BanhbaoCrypto, wrote. “The Defi super hero we all need but don't deserve!”",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | RESEARCH,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/17/white-hats-just-defused-a-potential-350m-heist-on-sushiswap,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/16a3d8c4e5fe653b17ae73925d28a9aa32352ee7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376402,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AQ3B,1629235253,"NFT Trading Surges 8X as Penguins, Apes Drive New Boom","Trading in non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, is soaring to multiples of the levels seen earlier this year when the phenomenon burst into public consciousness with breathless headlines in mainstream media and gasps among art dealers.      The number of sales on OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, reached more than 60,000 per day over the past week, nearly eight times the peak in March, according to a report by crypto intelligence firm Coin Metrics. According to another data tracker, DappRadar, OpenSea's trading volume over the past 30 days was $1.22 billion, up 933% from the previous 30 days.      Such growth suggests the hysteria epitomized by the artist Beeple's $69 million sale of his work, “Everydays: The First 5000 Days,” at Christie’s may have merely represented a glimpse of the industry's potential.      “If NFTs start gaining as much outside attention as they did earlier this year, there may be an even bigger boom yet to come,” wrote Coin Metrics.      The latest boom was partly driven by the sale of NFT collections such as CryptoPunk, Bored Ape Yacht Club and Pudgy Penguins.      Google search activity globally still ranks lower than in March:      A tricky question for cryptocurrency traders is how to play the trend. There's a chicken-and-egg dilemma over how the NFT market affects the price of ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, where much of the NFT ecosystem resides.      As NFTs are usually priced in ETH, a sudden rise in ETH price may deter new entrants to the NFT markets, the report noted. However, higher NFT sales may help attract new users to Ethereum.      In March and during the recent NFT boom, OpenSea sales and ether increased in tandem, according to Coin Metrics.

Bitcoin was trading around $45,418 at press time and is down about 1.6% over the past 24 hours.      Some analysts are optimistic about the long-term recovery in crypto prices, although the pace of the upside will likely slow over the short term.      “While many of the technical and on-chain indicators confirm this rebound’s strength, it may still be early to say we are out of the woods,” Nathan Cox, chief investment officer at digital asset management firm TwoPrime, wrote Tuesday in an email to investors.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $45,418, -1.59%  Ether (ETH) $3,103.5, -1.98%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4448, -0.7%  Gold: $1,785.01, -0.08%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.263%, down from 1.268% on Monday.    Traders are also monitoring the ongoing regulatory crackdown in several nations, which could damp bullish sentiment.      On Tuesday, the Shenzhen branch of the People’s Bank of China plans to “promptly clean up and rectify” 11 companies for providing illicit crypto trading activities, state-owned Shanghai Securities Journal reported.      In Spain, the National Securities Market Commission issued a warning notice for 12 companies, including crypto exchanges Huobi and Bybit, for providing investment services without being registered with authorities, CoinDesk’s Eliza Gkritsi reported.      And in South Korea, a crypto exchange subsidiary of Japanese tech giant LINE, is reportedly limiting its services next month, according to a report by Yonhap News.      For now, technical charts suggest bitcoin remains in breakout mode with support around $42,000. The loss of short-term momentum could trigger a brief period of profit taking.    Bitcoin mining revenue rise    Miners are experiencing greater revenue as the Bitcoin blockchain's hashrate recovers from July lows. This is a positive sign for the blockchain network and could point to further bitcoin accumulation by miners.      “Over the course of the last two months, hashrate has increased by around 25% from the lows, suggesting hashrate equivalent to around 12.5% of the affected miners have come back online,” Glassnode analysts wrote in a blog post.      The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power that is being used to mine and process transactions.      “In response, the Hash-Ribbons, which attempt to model where stress enters the mining market, have commenced another positive cross-over,” Glassnode wrote. “The Hash-Ribbons are formed by taking the 30-day and 60-day moving average of hashrate with the following signals,” as shown in the chart below.    Decreasing volume    Bitcoin’s trading volume on leading spot exchanges declined over the past week as the short-squeeze rally stalls.      “After the seven-day average real BTC trading volume pushed towards $7 billion last week, we’re now back to $5 billion,” Arcane Research wrote in a Tuesday report.      If bitcoin continues to trade higher on declining volume, “it can signify an exhausted market, and it will probably not be a sustainable move,” Arcane wrote. “We want to see a clear uptick in volume if the BTC price jumps up towards $50K again.”    Latest on Poly Network hack    The Poly Network cyberattack saga has dragged into its second week with the hacker or hackers yet to provide the key for the multi-signature wallet needed to complete the full return of the roughly $600 million that was stolen, with the exception of the $33 million worth of the stablecoin USDT that was frozen by Tether, reports CoinDesk’s Nelson Wang.      China-based Poly Network had previously offered $500,000 to the attacker or attackers as a reward for returning the money taken on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum and Polygon platforms in what is likely the largest-ever hack of a decentralized finance (DeFi) site.      In a message posted to the Ethereum blockchain at 1:45 p.m. UTC on Monday, the attacker, who the Poly Network is calling “Mr. White Hat” but who some others doubt is a true white-hat hacker, said that they were considering taking the bounty and using it to reward anyone else who can hack the cross-chain platform. A “white hat” attacker is one who tries to exploit vulnerabilities in a protocol to help expose and ultimately fix bugs or loopholes in the underlying code.      ”MONEY MEANS LITTLE TO ME, SOME PEOPLE ARE PAID TO HACK, I WOULD RATHER PAY FOR THE FUN,” the attacker or attackers wrote.    Altcoin roundup  AUDIO Market Cap Surges Past $1B: Prices for AUDIO, the governance token of decentralized music streaming protocol Audius, nearly doubled in the past 24 hours, pushing its market capitalization above $1 billion for the first time. The price surge comes after Audius announced its partnership with popular video-sharing app TikTok. Data from TradingView and FTX shows that AUDIO’s price started pumping around 16:00 UTC on Aug. 16 and reached a high at $4.04 at approximately 6:00 UTC on Aug. 17. News of the TikTok tie-up first emerged at 15:00 UTC on Aug. 16.  Dfinity’s ICP Rebounds: The blockchain company Dfinity made headlines in May when its internet computer (ICP) tokens were officially released for public trading at a price of $630, giving the project a $45 billion market capitalization. The enthusiasm quickly evaporated as the token plunged 95% over the following month to as low as $27. Since then, the token’s price has doubled to more than $60, according to data from Messari, signaling renewed appetite from investors. Some traders are feeling fresh enthusiasm for the token thanks to a recent increase in developer activity taking place on the network. That’s despite lingering ill will among some investors and developers, including dissidents who have formed a splinter group as well as plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit filed in a U.S. federal court.  1inch Network Launches on Ethereum Optimism: 1inch Network, a platform that aims to find the best deals across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs), has expanded to the Optimistic Ethereum mainnet.

The e-commerce, Alibaba Group, opened its market for NFT trading with an auction. The successful company has created a platform for musicians, software developers, writers, and artists to endeavor to sell their non-fungible tokens. These auction website developers have used various non-fungible tokens within the service. The auctions will start in September, although there is no specific date for the big event in Asia.

42376391,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6APt7,1629229943,How Blockchain Empowers Women in the Middle East,"Across the globe, women have been sidelined when it comes to finance and technology, and the Middle East is no exception. Luckily, things are changing, and the internet is providing new opportunities for learning and inclusion.      Blockchain offers a blank slate in the Middle East: a new industry where the rules have not yet been fully defined and where women can get involved and make it their own when given the right tools.    Amber Ghaddar, Ph.D., is co-founder of AllianceBlock.    It is no secret that in areas of the Middle East, women have far less financial autonomy in society than men. A 2020 McKinsey report on “women at work” in the Middle East found high inequalities persist, most notably in legal protection and financial inclusion with a significant number of women in the region remaining unbanked.      The distribution of knowledge is more egalitarian nowadays, as anyone with access to the internet can learn to code or trade. Decentralized finance (DeFi) can help to level the playing field when it comes to women’s finances, removing the need for intermediaries and reliance on centralized institutions that often fail to safeguard their money.      Brilliant initiatives such as All Girls Code are shaking up the status quo in the region by encouraging women to code and study science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) subjects at an university. Elsewhere, associations such as Arab Women In Code are leading the charge in giving women more skills. In my father’s home country of Lebanon, this institution was involved in hosting the first all-female hackathon in 2015, and similar events have continued to gain momentum since then.    Read more: Crypto Adoption in Middle East Will Come From Unstable Nations | Opinion    Where permitted, women in the Middle East stand to benefit disproportionately from access to cryptocurrency. The decentralized and anonymous nature of crypto transactions means that women will not be discriminated against based on their gender and can take control of their money without the involvement of intermediaries.      Digital currencies have been making inroads in the Middle East, with Dubai’s first crypto listing occurring this year, as well as the Bank of Israel’s trial of a digital shekel. In developing markets, crypto offers citizens a way to control their money without having to rely on the relative hardship or prosperity of their national economy.      In many areas, women are unequal in both the eyes of society and the law, which is compounded by overt prejudices in everyday life. Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) findings show women make up the majority of workers in healthcare and social services sectors in the Middle East and often play the role of homemakers and caregivers.      COVID-19, particularly in emerging markets, has compounded an already existing gender imbalance, with women far more likely to experience economic fallout from the crisis due to their economic status and professions. It is imbalances like this that reflect the necessity of alternative revenue streams and educational pathways for women.      In war-torn areas such as Lebanon, there is a huge diaspora among women and men alike, as citizens have had to flee economic crisis and potential starvation. For those citizens who still remain, crypto has become a way to work around a defunct financial system, whose local currency value plummeted more than 80% during an economic crisis that reached its apex in March 2020.    Digital currencies offer a means for women across the Middle East to take control of their finances    Citizens have increasingly turned to crypto to transfer their money, while using encrypted chat rooms on Telegram to leverage transactions. Here, we see an example of the freedom that cryptocurrencies can bring in times of hardship, providing a safe and anonymous way for people to take control of their finances when state institutions fail to do so. Women who are marginalized in the Middle East should note these freedoms and leverage digital currencies when possible and useful.      It's also important to note that blockchain is more than DeFi; it has the ability to reshape supply chains and redefine how countries do business, as well as being a force for social good. The work that Cardano is doing in Ethiopia to help the government track student academic performance in local schools is just one of many examples of the amazing ways blockchain’s tracking and data storage capacities can be used for social good.      Looking at these examples, women in the Middle East should take note of all the industries that can stand to benefit from blockchain and how they can make difference.    Read more: How Bitcoin Helps Afghan Girls Achieve Financial Freedom    Weaker governments and population exodus driven by warfare or instability often encourage more widespread adoption of emerging technologies such as blockchain and crypto, as citizens look outside of the state to manage their money and other affairs.      In the same vein, digital currencies offer a means for women across the Middle East to take control of their finances in times of hardship. With a more long-term view, women in the region should take note of the opportunities that the emerging blockchain sphere holds. Female blockchain developers are in high demand worldwide.      Non-commodity based economies with strong higher education rates, such as Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia, offer ripe opportunities for educated women to enter this exciting sector. When armed with the right education and resources, women in the Middle East can benefit from and contribute to blockchain, which in turn will help to increase their individual economic and social freedom.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Amber Ghaddar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/17/how-blockchain-empowers-women-in-the-middle-east,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b521ceff33abd1cda25f1b69b5318fef6f5137a4-2400x1351.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411913,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glh4ti,1629229879,What Is a ‘Semi-Fungible’ Crypto Token?,"Fungibility has been a consistent theme of 2021, following the meteoric rise of NFTs. But what’s the deal with “semi-fungible” tokens and how do they work?  The interest surrounding non-fungible tokens (NFTs) reached astounding levels in the first half of this year. Data from NonFungible showed NFT sales surged to over $2.4 billion in the first quarter – 20 times more than the previous three months. That momentum has showed no signs of slowing so far in the second half of the year, with the leading Ethereum-based NFT marketplace, OpenSea, experiencing a record high trading volume of $49 million on Aug. 1, up from its average daily average trading volume of $8.3 million. The average price of CryptoPunks – one of the first collections of NFTs to make their debut on Ethereum’s blockchain – also set a record during the same month of 66.919 ETH per NFT (about $220,000 at press time).  The explosive growth has kickstarted a new wave of innovation around non-fungible assets, including the emergence of a new type of “semi-fungible” token (SFT) that starts off fungible and becomes non-fungible. Let’s break down these terms.  Fungible tokens  The majority of crypto assets investors monitor and trade on a regular basis are fungible, i.e. they are easily interchangeable. For example, if two people exchanged one ether for another, there would be no loss of value and neither party would be better off than the other. That is because there is no value distinction between any two ether or any two bitcoin for that matter (excluding “tainted coins” – coins that had been previously stolen or used in illicit activities).  Fiat money like U.S dollars are also fungible. In other words, fungibility is the ability of a token (or currency) to be exchanged or replaced with other tokens of the same type resulting in no change in value.  Non-fungible tokens  NFTs are blockchain-based tokens that can be used to represent digital ownership of something unique and scarce such as artwork, collectibles, in-game times, soundtracks or virtual real estate. Because each item has a distinct value based on inherent characteristics like who created it or how rare it is, it means NFTs cannot be mutually exchanged like ether or U.S dollars. For example, a digital baseball card couldn't be exchanged 1:1 with a plot of virtual land. The two are completely different assets. Not to mention, the digital baseball card might be part of an exceptionally rare collection, and the plot of virtual land could be in an undesirable location.  Because NFTs are stored on a blockchain, it means each token has the following characteristics:  Indivisible: It’s not possible to purchase fractions of NFTs  Indestructible: Cannot be destroyed or removed  Immutable: Impossible to change the underlying information once it's stored  Verifiable: Because NFTs are stored on public blockchains, authenticity and ownership can be easily verified by anyone at any time  What are semi-fungible tokens?  SFTs are a relatively new group of tokens that can be both fungible and non-fungible during their lifecycle. Initially, SFTs act like regular fungible tokens in that they can be traded like-for-like with other identical SFTs.  For example, a token that represents a valid $10 Amazon voucher would have the same value as an identical voucher with the same expiration date and would therefore be interchangeable.  The distinguishing factor that makes these special types of tokens “semi-fungible” is that once they’re redeemed, the fungible tokens lose their face value. That loss of exchangeable value makes the expired tokens non-fungible.  Another way to understand this is to imagine owning a token that represented a concert ticket to see The Beatles’ last-ever performance. The ticket would have a face value and could be exchanged for another identical concert ticket, provided it was the same band on the same date and in the same seating area. Once the concert ended, the token representing the ticket would then become collectible memorabilia and have an entirely new value. It would also mean that the token could no longer be exchanged for a valid concert ticket of the same initial face value to see a different band.  That process of transforming from a fungible to a non-fungible token upon redemption is where semi-fungible tokens get their name.  How to create semi-fungible tokens  Today, it’s possible to mint SFTs using Ethereum’s ERC-1155 standard. That is one of several Ethereum token standards – blueprints for creating tokens on the Ethereum blockchain that are compatible with all other ERC-based projects.  The ERC-1155 standard was developed by blockchain game developers Enjin, Horizon Games and The Sandbox in 2017, and is essentially a combination of the ERC-20 (fungible token) and ERC-721 (non-fungible token) standards. This makes it possible to create and manage both fungible and non-fungible tokens using a single smart contract – a computer program that self-executes when certain conditions arise.  SFTs are particularly useful in the gaming industry where there are fungible elements such as in-game currency like gold bars or V-Bucks, as well as non-fungible items like collectibles and weapons. This means gaming companies can create both types of tokens and ensure they’re interoperable so that gamers can easily trade things like weapons for gold bars and vice versa.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FIAT | TRADING,Anatol Antonovici,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/17/what-is-a-semi-fungible-crypto-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ce3f63471aed9f548bfdae7b0d9fc85b84bc758-1885x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A review of regulatory documents reveals that a parade of megabanks, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, CitiGroup and Bank of America; asset managers such as Millennium Management, BlackRock and Miller Value Partners; and even states such as Tennessee's Treasury, have told securities regulators they held COIN on June 30.

42376380,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6APgX,1629226913,Dfinity's ICP Rebounds Even as Wounds Fester From Token Launch,"The blockchain company Dfinity made headlines in May when its internet computer (ICP) tokens were officially released for public trading at a price of $630, giving the project a $45 billion market capitalization. The enthusiasm quickly evaporated as the token plunged 95% over the following month to as low as $27.      Since then, the token’s price has doubled to more than $60, according to data from Messari, signaling renewed appetite from investors.      Some traders are feeling fresh enthusiasm for the token thanks to a recent increase in developer activity taking place on the network. That's despite lingering ill will among some investors and developers, including dissidents who have formed a splinter group as well as plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit filed in a U.S. federal court.      According to Dfinity, as of July, just 10 weeks after its public trading launch, the Internet Computer network had attracted 500 developers and nearly 250,000 users of its applications. Earlier this month, Dfinity announced that a project called distrikt, described as the world’s first decentralized social media network running entirely on a blockchain, had launched on the Internet Computer network.      “There’s interest from developers and engineers because ICP is superfast to build on,” said Tom Serres, ICP investor and co-founder of Warburg Serres Investments. “This is what differentiates it from Ethereum.”      The token allows users to participate in and govern the Internet Computer network, which aims to help users publish on the Internet while avoiding going through large tech giants such as Amazon or Facebook. The network was built by the Swiss-based Dfinity Foundation and currently has a market cap of just over $8.5 billion.      According to Messari, Internet Computer will rely more on large data centers and high-end node machines (validators) when compared to networks like Ethereum.      “The mainnet of Dfinity runs on world-class servers and data centers, making the speed faster, almost instant,” said Serres.    Read more: State of Crypto: The Crypto Provision in the Infrastructure Bill Now Depends on Non-Crypto Issues     Dfinity has faced extensive backlash for its handling of the token launch and now, with founder Dominic Williams, faces a class action complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.      According to the class action complaint, ""Defendants have promoted, offered and sold throughout the United States unregistered securities called 'ICP tokens' and have engaged in insider trading of such securities, in violation of federal law.""      The complaint goes on to say that “by selling and promoting these unregistered security tokens to investors, and by transacting in them while in possession of material, non-public information, defendants have reaped billions of dollars in profits.”      A group of former ICP community members frustrated with Dfinity’s leadership and what they describe as a lack of transparency has formed a splinter group called ICP Reboot. The collective says it aims to “relaunch” the ICP protocol by forking the project to “establish democratic control over this new network,” according to a website for the group.      Ross Jackson, who identified himself as a marketing volunteer for ICP Reboot, said he found frustration with Dfinity’s handling of the token distribution in May.      According to Jackson, most members of the new ICP Reboot community were part of the seed or presale rounds of ICP funding, and some of them have a significant stake in ICP. The ICP Reboot project is funded by donations and operates on a volunteer basis, he said.      “Dfinity didn’t provide concrete information on how to access wallets in the lead-up to the Genesis event,” said Jackson. He said Dfinity and other venture-capital investors had no vesting periods imposed on them, but the project’s leaders didn’t announce that fact until 16 days after the launch.      “This allowed these insiders to sell large quantities of ICP while pre-sale, seed round and retail investors were getting squashed,” said Jackson.      Jackson said Dfinity executives have not been transparent with the community members of ICP and external stakeholders about how many tokens they have sold since the event in May and have avoided most questions regarding the matter. Additionally, Dfinity only announced that insiders were not vested 16 days after the launch of ICP, said Jackson.      On Twitter, BlockTower Capital co-founder Ari Paul wrote that it ""seems impossible to get accurate info on Dfinity on some of the most basic and critical financial aspects.""      According to a report published in June by Arkham Intelligence that analyzed blockchain data, “It appears Dfinity was not transparent about how tokens were distributed and when they would be unlocked, contrary to industry best practices.”      “What we found from our research concerned many ICP investors and worried me as well,” said Miguel Morel, CEO of Arkham Intelligence, a crypto analysis firm, in an interview. “I wanted to help clarify these questions.”      Dfinity “quietly allowed the treasury and insiders to send 18.9 million of ICP to exchanges, while making it extremely difficult for their longtime supporters to access the tokens they were promised,” according to the report.      Dfinity's founder Dominic Williams said in an email with CoinDesk that there's a lot of ""misinformation out there (primarily, shills from blockchains that are being made obsolete, people wanting to manipulate markets, and lawyers trying to extort money),"" and that he would soon rebut this in a blog post.      “This project is going to be huge and it’s a shame media reporting is so dominated by noise from detractors,” Williams wrote in the email.    Read more: Ex-Goldman Sachs Traders Raise $4M for DeFi Risk Management Startup    So why the recent investor interest?      “ICP is built with a view that Web 3.0 is a matter of when, and not if,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital. “Thus it is no surprise that it has been one of the best performers.”      Web 3.0 represents a vision of the future of the Internet, powered by blockchain-enabled financial applications and focusing on making data interconnected in a decentralized way. It's considered a leap forward from the current generation of the Internet, referred to as Web 2.0, where data is stored in centralized repositories, according to CoinMarketCap.      “It’s open and it cuts out the middleman,” said Pablo Quiroga, COO of Star Atlas, a virtual gaming metaverse, when describing Web 3.0. “ICP created an environment where gatekeepers are bypassed, demonopolization is happening and the buildout of technology is democratized.”      “ICP’s price action in the last few weeks is likely driven by news of ongoing traction in their ecosystem,” said Kay Khemani, managing director at Spectre.ai.      DeckDeckGO, ICDrive and Distrikapp, an ICP-powered social platform, are examples of recent additions to their growing library of decentralized applications, or dapps, according to Khemani.      He said that currently over 1,400 developers are developing dapps for ICP.      Internet Computer announced Aug. 12 that Windows users can now access dapps through its ‘Internet Identity,’ opening up a huge new user base for Internet Computer-based dapps.      “As we see with Ethereum, the more the developer activity, the stronger the tailwind on price,"" said Khemani.      Some analysts in digital-asset markets have also been scrutinizing flows of the ICP tokens on and off of cryptocurrency exchanges. Inflows are often interpreted as traders moving their tokens into position to sell, while outflows are seen as traders moving tokens to longer-term custody or wallets, with the intent to hold.      “ICP seemingly had its largest exchange inflow days in May and June,"" Morel said. ""Its largest exchange outflows appear to have been in July and August. This, combined with overall market bullishness recently, is what traders I know have stated as a reason for ICP’s recent price increase.”    Read more: DeFi’s 1inch Network Launches on Ethereum Scaling Platform Optimism    Matt Blom, global head of sales trading at Diginex, said he predicts ICP could “rally hard” at some point.

Centralized Exchanges Observe $222 Million Worth Of Stablecoin Inflows As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, centralized exchanges saw inflows of more than $222 million worth of stablecoins yesterday. The timing of this huge spike seems to match up with that of Bitcoin&apos;s price showing a dip. The exchange inflow is an indicator that shows the amount of stablecoins entering centralized exchanges from personal wallets. When the value of this metric goes up, it means more investors are sending their coins to these exchanges for buying other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Similarly, when the stablecoins inflow indicator goes down, it could imply traders aren&apos;t interested in trading their coins. They may want to wait to see how the price of volatile crypto moves before buying into the market. Opposite to the above metric is the outflow indicator. And the difference between these two gives the netflow. Positive netflow implies more inflows, while negative means more outflows. Now, here is how the chart of this metric looks like right now: The stablecoins netflows (red) spiked up on 16 August | Source: CryptoQuant As the above graph showcases, the value of this indicator shot up yesterday as $222 million worth of stablecoins flew into centralized exchanges.

42376385,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6APkJ,1629224501,TON Legacy: How Telegram's Crypto Coin Lives On,"If the TON blockchain project by Telegram is dead, it’s having a busy afterlife with at least two forks managed by two competing communities.      A token running on the TON-derived blockchain, named TON Crystal, is now trading on several exchanges. Another competing token named TON Coin has been listed on EXMO, a crypto exchange, since last Monday and is now available to traders in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), exchange spokeswoman Alesya Sypalo told CoinDesk.      She added that the listing was a paid one but didn't disclose who paid for the service, only saying that Anatoly Makosov, one of the developers supporting the network, was “a point of contact” for the listing agreement. Makosov didn't respond to CoinDesk’s question if he himself arranged the listing.      Both TON Crystal and TON Coin are using the TON brand and technology that was originally created by Telegram. Despite their common origin, the two communities keep apart from each other.      That’s far from the only vital signs the TON blockchain project has shown in recent months.      The official website of the project, ton.org, came alive on Aug. 4 after more than a year of radio silence. The Telegram team, which had been maintaining the project’s repository, hadn’t updated the site since April 2020, right before the project was shelved.      Now, the website displays information about one of the TON successors, The Open Network, which was previously named Newton. The network is maintained by a community of developers (led by Makosov) and validators that believes in the ultimate success of the ambitious blockchain project, which started as a $1.7 billion Web 3.0 utopia but drowned in a legal fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over the status of its native token.      CoinDesk tried to figure out who is now maintaining the projects bearing the name of TON, why they are doing so and why they are competing with each other.    Telegram kisses goodbye    Telegram, the company behind the popular messenger app, dropped its plans to launch a blockchain in 2020, after two years of work and a massive, $1.7 billion token fundraising effort. Telegram Open Network was supposed to be a combination of a cryptocurrency and a range of decentralized services based on a native proof-of-stake blockchain.      The concept included a decentralized domain name service (DNS), a virtual private network (VPN), file sharing and other features, which would, if implemented, create a complete Web 3.0 universe on the TON blockchain. All of that could be integrated with the Telegram messaging app, which back then boasted hundreds of millions of users.      Not surprisingly, investors around the world, from Silicon Valley elite to Russian oligarchs, lined up to invest in the pre-sale of the future tokens.      The project was originally slated to go live in October 2019, but just weeks before launch, the SEC sued the company, citing securities law violation, and halted the launch. After nine months in court, Telegram quit the case and settled with the SEC, paying a penalty of $18.5 million.      In May 2020, Telegram announced that it would no longer support the project, blaming the U.S. regulator. Before quitting, however, Telegram made TON’s code open source. The GitHub repository and the official website went radio silent after that, with one exception.      In early July 2020, a new feature was added to the blockchain code: “testgiver” contracts that provided a way for users to obtain pre-mined tokens using a proof-of-work algorithm. That allowed anyone who could set up a node to “mine” some tokens without buying them, although such a feature was not supposed to be a part of TON, which by design was coded as a proof-of-stake blockchain.      That proof-of-work option provided a chance for one of the TON offspring to exist.    Free TON rises    After Telegram officially backed off from its blockchain project, it left behind a notable community of developers and small blockchain startups that had been waiting for TON to go live and had invested time, effort and computation power in the future blockchain. Many were not happy with the idea that it all had been in vain.      The disappointed group included developers who took part in Telegram’s blockchain hackathons while TON was under development, a bunch of small firms that had been getting ready to integrate Telegram’s cryptocurrency in their business models and would-be validators.      These people decided that even though Telegram was no longer involved, the ambitious blockchain project had a future.      One such community launched a blockchain named Free TON, with a native token called TON Crystal, in May 2020. The effort was led by TON Labs, a venture-backed tech company that helped Telegram to run the TON testnet early on, and some professional validator firms in Europe, such as Everstake, P2P and Certus One.      The native token, called TON Crystal (TON), has been since listed and traded against the USDT stablecoin on several crypto exchanges, namely, CEX, DigiFinex and Kuna. The community has recently launched decentralized finance (DeFi) features, like yield farming, and native non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces.      The token has been integrated in wallet apps Changelly, Free Wallet and Lumi, and the community launched the bridge between the Free TON and Ethereum blockchains. According to Aleksandr Tetyukhin, who is responsible for FreeTON-related issues at the Everstake staking platform, at the moment, around 440 validators are active in the network.      In addition to that, the developers recently published a new white paper, bringing ""significant changes in philosophy and code base innovations"" to the original TON concept by Nikolai Durov, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov’s brother. The new white paper “elevates Pavel Durov’s concept of freedom to a new level,” Alexander Filatov, co-founder and CEO of TON Labs, told CoinDesk.      The document is now up for comments and evaluation by the community on the Free TON-dedicated forum.    Another, new TON    However, not all of the early supporters of Telegram’s blockchain utopia joined the Free TON party – some walked away to make their own version of TON. One of them, dubbed Newton, has been run by a different community of developers, who initially stayed out of public view.      However, in late June, one of them, developer Anatoly Makosov, published a request on GitHub to the Telegram team to hand over the ownership of the ton.org domain and the Github repository to the Newton community (Makosov’s nickname is tolya-yanot, which is the author of the request). The owner of the ton-blockchain repository, presumably the Telegram developers, agreed to that request.      Since then, content on the ton.org website, previously updated by the Telegram team, was fully replaced by information about the Newton project. The GitHub repository hasn’t been updated by the presumed new owners yet. Telegram didn't return CoinDesk’s request for comment.      Makosov told CoinDesk that when Telegram halted its own validators and stopped supporting the testnet, the team transferred the pre-mined tokens it had to the “testgiver” smart contracts and provided a way to mine them, and there is a notable number of miners doing that at this point.      “So we realized that the token has value and started to discuss if we should create another testnet,” Makosov said.      He added that he doesn’t know how many people and entities are involved in the TON “mining.”      A validator who asked not to be named said that according to his observations, around 500 addresses are actively mining at this point, all using quite powerful hardware. It’s hard to tell how many of those addresses belong to the same people, but he knows about at least 20 independent miners and entities that are accumulating tokens at this moment, using no fewer than 2,000 servers in total. Those individuals and entities, however, are not willing to disclose their names.    The competition    TON Labs’ Filatov said that the company secured rights for the “TON” and “The Open Network” brands in 41 countries, but struck a peaceful tone in a comment about the rival project, voicing hope that “all of that is open source [and] it will enrich the ecosystem at large.”      “I am genuinely hoping that 98% of TON coins that were already mined have value and owners behind them who would contribute to the network,” Filatov added.      Gregory Waisman, chief operation officer of the wallet app Mercuryo and a supporter of Newton, told CoinDesk that he believes Newton is closer to the initial concept created by Telegram. That Telegram transferred the ownership of ton.org to Newton underscores that Telegram “trusts the further development of the project to Newton,” he said.      Fedor Skuratov, former communications manager at TON Labs, believes that association with the original TON project by Telegram, in fact, does more harm than good because of the legal history of the project and the fact that it was effectively banned by the SEC.      “The very name of TON became a negative factor for many potential partners, investors, banks and regulators. Free TON already got affected by that, and any other projects will be as well,” Skuratov said, adding that at this point, any hint to a connection with Telegram sounds good only for Telegram’s fans.      For that reason, the Free TON community chose to distance themselves from Telegram as far as possible, while the Newton community prefers to underscore its dedication to the original Telegram’s concept. Skuratov doesn't believe that Telegram itself is interested in the issue.      “Both Durovs have turned the page on TON for good,” he said, adding that Telegram simply wrote the project off and handed over the website and code repository to “those who asked first.”      Telegram didn't respond to questions about whether the company was supporting the Newton project.

42424775,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWRjh,1629219600,Blockstream Energy Could Let Bitcoin Miners Set Up Anywhere There's a Power Source,"Bitcoin and blockchain infrastructure company Blockstream has introduced Blockstream Energy, its new service for energy producers to sell excess electricity to proof-of-work miners. Combined with connectivity provided by the Blockstream satellite, the new service is designed to expand the potential reach of bitcoin mining to renewable energy sources even in remote locations.      Blockstream Mining provides bitcoin mining equipment to institutional and enterprise customers. It also offers hosting services where it deploys mining equipment and then turns over full control of the rigs to the customer.      Blockstream Energy utilizes modular mining units (MMUs), which are essentially independent mining facilities that can be operated remotely. Power producers like turbine or nuclear power plant owners can sell energy to the operators of these MMUs that otherwise would have gone unused.      “For the first time, energy producers can control and scale demand to meet their supply. This incredibly powerful tool can be used to make existing electrical grids far more efficient while also significantly improving the economics of renewable energy projects,” said Chris Cook, CIO and head of mining at Blockstream.      Energy producers can use Blockstream MMUs for a variety of purposes including balancing electric grids and improving carbon trading strategies. Since MMUs can be shipped globally and are plug-and-play, many renewable energy mixes can fuel them. Blockstream deploys these MMUs to energy production sites in order to enable scalable and dynamically adjustable energy demand.    Managing bitcoin mining from space    “Much of the world’s usable renewable sources are concentrated in remote locations where there is little local demand and not much surrounding infrastructure,” said Adam Back, chief executive officer at Blockstream.    Read more: Bitcoin and the Space Race    The global Blockstream Satellite network can connect to MMUs anywhere in the world and allow their operators to manage them remotely, opening up the potential for them to situate their operations at sites isolated from high-demand civilian or commercial power infrastructures. Renewable energy generation facilities, therefore, can locate in a variety of locations, such as near isolated waterfalls or volcanos, and take advantage of profitable energy sources that might otherwise be inaccessible.

42424769,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWRTh,1629219483,The Poly Hack and Crypto's Trust Issues,"“And now, folks, it’s time for: Who do you trust? Hubba hubba hubba, money money money. Who do you trust? Me, I’m giving away free money. And where’s the Batman? At home, washing his tights!” – The Joker (Batman 1989)      When the Poly Network was hacked early last week for about $600 million worth of various cryptocurrencies, the attack was notable mainly for its size. It’s the biggest crypto hack ever – though not by much over 2018’s $500 million Coincheck hack. From 50,000 feet, it seemed like the logical progression of a series of hacks going back to the exploit that allegedly brought down Mt. Gox circa 2013, itself worth about $473 million at 2014 BTC prices.      In short, despite its size, the Poly hack just wasn’t all that interesting.      Then things got weird.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    The hacker reportedly entered multiparty negotiations including Poly, miners, security firm Slowmist and the stablecoin issuer Tether. The nature of those negotiations still isn’t entirely clear, but we do know at least two things: Poly had offered the hacker a $500,000 “bug bounty” to return the stolen funds, and Slowmist claims it identified the hacker’s IP and email addresses (though the hacker denied being compromised).      A third strong hypothesis is that the hacker was beginning to realize he/she/they would have a very hard time liquidating anything close to $600 million in tokens (we don’t know the hacker’s gender, but I’ll be using ""he"" throughout for simplicity, and because odds are it’s accurate). Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao promised his exchange would “freeze” any hacked funds sent to his platform, while Tether actually took the step to freeze about $33 million worth of its USDT stablecoin taken in the hack.      There may have been other factors, but these alone were likely enough to trigger what came next: The hacker returned the money. By Thursday, Aug. 12, the hacker had placed almost all of the hacked funds (minus those frozen tethers) into a multi-signature wallet shared with the Poly team.      In other words, this is the proverbial dog who caught a car. After pulling off the biggest crypto heist of all time, the hacker didn’t know what to do with their loot.    Face turn    Now, with help from the Poly Network itself, the hacker is trying to make what in pro wrestling is known as a “face turn”: a sudden transition from villain to hero.      On the morning of Aug. 16, the hacker posted a message via a verified Ethereum address including the following:      “MONEY MEANS LITTLE TO ME, SOME PEOPLE ARE PAID TO HACK, I WOULD RATHER PAY FOR THE FUN. I AM CONSIDERING TAKING THE BOUNTY AS A BOUNUS [sic] FOR PUBLIC HACKERS IF THEY CAN HACK THE POLY NETWORK ... IF THE POLY DON’T GIVE THE IMAGINARY BOUNTY, AS EVERYBODY EXPECTS, I HAVE WELL ENOUGH BUDGET TO LET THE SHOW GO ON.”      “I TRUST SOME OF THEIR CODE, I WOULD PRAISE THE OVERALL DESIGN OF THE PROJECT, BUT I NEVER TRUST THE WHOLE POLY TEAM.”      In other words (to clarify the apparently machine-translated note), the biggest crypto hacker of all time says he did it for the lulz. But also, building on statements made Aug. 11, he claims to be a benign hacker simply out to highlight a design flaw rather than actually steal money. It was “always the plan” to return the funds, he claims – and now he’s even willing to use his own money to pay further “bounties” to hackers who help find and fix exploits in Poly. He’s a full-blown Good Samaritan!      The Poly Network has helped along this face turn immensely by giving the hacker a very flattering nickname while angling for the return of the stolen funds: Mr. White Hat.      “White Hat,” of course, is a reference to a “white hat” hacker. A white hat hacker, in principle, only tests software vulnerabilities to help fix them, rather than to exploit them for gain. A “black hat,” by contrast, hacks for profit or malice.      Poly Network’s motives for pre-emptively dubbing the hacker a “white hat” are pretty clear: It gives the hacker a path to returning the funds and, perhaps, salvaging their reputation. For Poly, the return of funds is the only priority and this strategy is brilliant: You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar, after all.      But aside from Poly’s friendly nickname and his own statements, there’s very little clear evidence that the hacker’s original intentions were good. Among other contradictory evidence, it’s unclear why he would have moved $600 million when the exploit could have been demonstrated with a much smaller hack.    Hubba Hubba Hubba, who do you trust?    The situation highlights a tension that has grown along with the cryptocurrency ecosystem. “Trustlessness” is a core tenet of crypto, both technologically and philosophically. Broadly, this is a claim that trust can be placed in stable and secure blockchain systems, rather than fallible and selfish humans.      But with growing complexity, competition and stakes, the need for trust in the humans behind crypto has grown. So have the consequences of misplacing that trust. This applies most obviously to users of the Poly Network, who entrusted their funds to it: The various stolen tokens had been entrusted to the protocol, which acts as a custodian as part of its cross-chain functionality.      But the hack drives home the fact that they weren’t really trusting the system – they were trusting the network’s designers and coders. That trust has been shaken by the apparent flaws in their code. Poly is not alone in that, by a longshot: as mentioned, hacks and exploits have become frequent, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) systems, whose complexity makes them inherently more vulnerable than a simpler system like Bitcoin.    Read more: $600M Poly Heist Shows DeFi Needs Hackers to Become Unhackable | Dan Kuhn    As CoinDesk’s Daniel Kuhn has argued, these hacks can be seen as part of the process of making these systems more secure. The hacker, whether it was his initial intent or not, has made Poly stronger.      Nonetheless, these hacks highlight an uncomfortable truth: In DeFi, the reputation of the people building the systems matters. And the Poly hack specifically shows one reason this is a problem. Poly is a project in part backed by the team behind Neo, a blockchain founded in China in 2014. For a person in the U.S. or Europe to trust them requires crossing the very barriers of language, geography and politics that crypto was supposed to dissolve.      Instead, the gap has fostered some outright conspiratorial thinking about Poly’s motives. This morning, Poly announced that it would offer Mr. White Hat a role as its Chief Security Advisor. This is most likely part of the network’s honey-dripping strategy to stay in the hacker’s good graces. But it has also triggered speculation that the hack itself was an inside job intended as a marketing stunt.      Another major aspect of trustlessness in crypto is finality. In Satoshi Nakamoto’s 2008 white paper describing Bitcoin, he writes that “completely non-reversible” transactions are a feature, not a bug, of the system: “With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads.” Ultimately, that’s because reversibility requires an arbiter – a dreaded “third party” with the power to decide who’s in the right, then stop or return transactions. But eliminating third-party intermediaries is the entire point of cryptocurrency, the feature that makes it unique among digital payment tools (and, at least in modern times, among currencies as a whole).      What I’m getting at here, of course, is tether. The stablecoin is a major underpinning of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, with a market cap of $63 billion and a key role in facilitating trading. Most users likely think of tether as a “cryptocurrency” roughly akin to bitcoin, but its response to the hack puts the lie to that.      By freezing $33 million involved in the hack, the company behind tether demonstrated it is a “trusted intermediary.” Just like a bank (which it effectively is, in many senses), Tether has demonstrated that it can freeze any funds moving on the network, at any time. When you use it, you’re placing faith in Tether’s central administrators not to freeze your funds. (The same, to be clear, is true of tether competitor USDC, though Circle, the company behind USDC, chose not to intervene in the current case.)      And so, grim as it may be, it’s inarguable that crypto systems now increasingly invite the same timeless philosophical quandary we face when dealing with the traditional financial system:      Hubba hubba hubba, who do you trust?",NEGATIVE,BTC | USDT | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | USDT | USDC,David Z.

42394462,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdo8D,1629219238,Props Shutdown Throws Reg A+ Funding Model Into Limbo,"Four young adults, two men and two women, were talking about ways to make vegan sausages edible when I showed up with my pesky questions. I was reporting on Props, a social media cryptocurrency experiment that has become a semi-prominent feature of the streaming platform we were all on, YouNow. How they’re used, whether they’re liked and if you’re sad to see them go.  The one with the cockney accent and a mess of curly hair, DrWhyBrother, was first to respond. He liked Props because it helped him monetize his streaming account, but thought it “should go back to how it was” before ""they"" made it more difficult to “level up.” He wasn’t yet aware that the program was going to fade out entirely in four months. “What's that going to do with the chests though, Abbie?” She didn’t know. No one knew. Before long they were back to discussing vegan mayonnaise.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  I may have been an intrusion into breakfast talk, but it was all part of the show. YouNow is a platform built for streamers and their audience in the age of hyperconnectivity and endless engagement. It offers an easy way to go “live” (usually from your bedroom) and banter about anything with complete strangers or friends. Anything can become “content.” Props, an early Web 3.0 token experiment, was a way to make money off this stream of entertainment about everything and nothing.  It was an innovative idea, given the regulatory stamp of approval, that is now calling it quits. Announced Friday, Props will shut down its loyalty rewards program and cease maintaining the Props protocol at the end of the year.  “[F]ollowing years of work and the devotion of substantial resources, we have not been able to develop Props Tokens in ways that could lead to commercial success, and there is no reasonable prospect of that happening in the future, given the regulatory framework,” YouNow founder and Open Props CEO Adi Sideman wrote in a farewell blog post published Aug. 12.  Social media has become synonymous with “influencers,” or the superusers on apps like TikTok, Instagram and YouTube, who command a significant audience of followers. Under this model, the talented, the attractive and entertaining can make fortunes. It’s a data business: the more eyes you can attract, the more you make. Of course, the data brokers, the platforms themselves, earn the most.  Props, developed by YouNow, was proposed as a way to share this wealth. Creators would earn tokens for creating, but so would users for the value they create on the platform by watching, liking and sharing content. It would give everyone a financial stake in the success of the platform. I earned 0.0001 props just for logging on today.  In 2019, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) granted Props permission to offer a valuable securities-like product to non-accredited investors, users, apps and validators. It was under the Regulation A+ (Reg A) equity qualification, which at the time seemed like the way forward for token projects in the wake of the collapsed initial coin offering (ICO) market.  Read more: ICO Mania Revisited: The Investors and Token Issuers Who Made Good  The tokens weren’t a way to raise capital for the network – Props pre-sold $21 million worth of tokens to Union Square Ventures, Comcast, Venrock, Andreessen Horowitz’s Chris Dixon and YouTuber Casey Neistat – but a way to grant some sort of ownership over a platform to users. It was integrated into five other platforms as well – testing the viability of interoperable social networks – and had some 10 million users.  “To build great products, startups need flexibility and agility to evolve and enhance their offering in response to user behavior, customer needs, available tech and market trends,” Sideman wrote. The project had planned to expand into staking, non-fungible tokens and expand onto U.S. exchanges.  But the status as a “qualified securities” meant that every significant update or change would have to go through an approval process with the SEC, Sideman wrote. “[W]e are unable to follow anything remotely like proper product development of ‘launch, measure, iterate’ and struggle to launch new key functionalities we develop,” he said.  ""We are profoundly grateful for the support of the community. We struggled mightily to make Props tokens and the Props Loyalty Program commercially viable, hoping it would grow and grow. We are saddened that regulatory conditions have let us and our community down,"" Sideman told CoinDesk through a spokesperson.  The news certainly puts a damper on the viability of Reg A for token founders looking to build the next-generation web powered by crypto.  Read more: SEC Chairman Gensler Agrees With Predecessor: ‘Every ICO Is a Security’  That said, Blockstack, an alternate layer 1 that shares consensus with Bitcoin, was given Reg A approval around the same time as Props. Now called Stacks, the protocol’s founders raised a lump sum of funding from 4,500+ investors, rather than pursuing an ongoing offering. “Given it’s a compliant offering, we don’t have to worry about regulators saying down the road that this was an illegal offering of securities,” Stacks co-founder Muneeb Ali said.  Reg A still presents a path forward for token founders if they want to be compliant, he added, but it depends on how you’re using it, and whether you’re willing to pay the “significant cost of reporting.” It’s either that, or block U.S. investors from participating.  In recent weeks, U.S. securities regulators have come out hard against crypto markets. SEC Chair Gary Gensler echoed his predecessor’s comments by saying most ICOs were likely securities, and many were unregistered. SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, a champion for the industry, has called out the utter lack of clarity around regulated crypto offerings.  It’s a matter that could determine the future of the crypto industry, though for users it doesn’t seem to register.  “I basically have no idea,” Jemy, another YouNow streamer, said about Props. “I just came here to hang.”  CORRECTION (OCT. 4, 2021): What was once called Blockstack is a layer 1 blockchain, not a sidechain of Bitcoin.

Shares were rising 7% to $6.84 on Tuesday following the release of the report.  BIT Mining's total net revenue was $445 million for the quarter, compared with just $3 million in Q1 2021 and $550,000 in the year-ago quarter.  The vast majority of its income, 95% as per the earnings report, came from newly acquired mining pool BTC.com, operated by BitDeer.  But BIT Mining's $2 million in net income in Q1 2021 turned into a net loss of $15.2 million for the three months ending June 30. BIT Mining attributed the loss to investments that fueled its expansion into crypto and a steep fall in crypto prices.  Operating costs increased in line with the revenue increase, from $5.6 million in Q1 to $443.9 million in Q2.  BIT Mining's cash and cash equivalents have also dwindled by two-thirds to $10.1 million as it invested in mining.  Previously an online sports lottery operator called 500.com, BIT Mining announcedhttps://finance.yahoo.com/finance/news/500-com-entered-agreement-acquire-121200514.html it was pivoting to mining in January. The company has now completed its transformation into a crypto mining and data center company, it said. BIT Mining's theoretical total bitcoin mining capacity is 1,425.3 PH/s, the report said.  BIT Mining has started mining ether outside of China, where a regulatory crackdown has sent miners fleeing, and produces 13 ether a day. It plans to expand its ether mining capacity to 4,800 GH/s by the end of October.  The company has shipped 7,849 bitcoin mining machines to Kazakhstan according to the report, part of its plan to move its operations out of China. Its data centers in China's Sichuan province, which authorities ordered shut down in June, brought in $11.4 million in the quarter.

TZero provides an alternative trading system for companies to digitize and issue equity to investors on its blockchain-based platform.  In June, people at tZERO parent company Overstock revealed to CoinDesk that the platform was looking for a buyer to take it to the next level.  A number of routes were available to tZERO, according to Michael Mougias, VP of investor relations, who stated the goal was not to find an outright buyer but the right strategic partners.

The Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act has been reintroduced to ""remedy concerning"" proposed guidance, according to an announcement Tuesday.  The concerns center on blockchain developers and service providers such as miners having to register as money transmitters, which Emmer believes should not be the case as they ""never custody consumer funds.""  ""Blockchain service providers need clear rules of the road to be able to develop and invest in the United States, and this clarity is more necessary than ever as the FATF tries to encapsulate more non-custodial blockchain developers in the money transmission system,"" Emmer said.

One provision of the infrastructure bill expands the definition of a “broker,” leading to concerns the Internal Revenue Service might seek to impose broker information reporting requirements on non-broker entities such as miners.  The reintroduction of the bill is being supported by the Chamber of Digital Commerce, Coin Center and the Blockchain Association.  In July, Emmer re-introduced a separate bill, the Securities Clarity Act, that would treat digital assets as commodities, not securities, meaning startups would be free to sell and trade cryptocurrencies without having to worry about registering them as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Choice Words From Iconic Trader Peter Brandt According to Peter, the concept of converting a traditional fiat currency such as the dollar or the euro into a digital fiat unit such as Tether, just in order to protect its store of wealth against inflation, is a meaningless process as it serves no purpose. Circular reasoning - TETHER The idea that we convert one fiat currency unit (USD, EUR, et al) into another fiat currency unit (tether) so as to protect the store of wealth of the first fiat currency unit is nothing but a gigantic mind fart. — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) August 16, 2021 Though there are many who agree with Peter&apos;s tweet, a few have valid arguments against it.

Shyft’s Veriscope solution, which uses blockchain smart contracts to identify exchange addresses and privately share know-your-customer (KYC) data, is also collaborating with Binance, Bitfinex, Tether, Huobi and 30 or so other virtual asset service providers (VASPs).      The FATF’s “Travel Rule” guidance requires that financial services firms, including VASPs, exchange personally identifiable information (PII) about customers sending and receiving funds over a certain amount in a bid to counter money laundering and terrorist financing.      There are a number of approaches to solving the “Travel Rule” for pseudonymous-by-design cryptocurrency transactions: some are focused on one region or jurisdiction, some use centralized databases.      Shyft is focused on a decentralized approach using smart contracts to create a global attestation layer. Around a year and a half ago, the network formed a governance group and task force, which included around 20 exchanges, and which was chaired by Rick McDonell, former executive secretary to the FATF.

42424771,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWRXh,1629207906,Steve Aoki Has Secured Funding to Pilot His NFT TV Show,"DJ Steve Aoki is doubling down on his stop-motion short “Dominion X” after the non-fungible token (NFT) project’s near-instant sellout earlier this month.      The festival staple has secured financing for a “proper pilot” episode of his trippy, music-infused collaboration with Stoopid Buddy Stoodios, the Seth Green production company best known for Robot Chicken, according to his manager Matt Colon. He declined to provide details of the financing.      “The enthusiasm around the initial sale gave us the confidence to secure financing for a proper pilot,” Colon said. ""Dominion X"" sold 500 NFTs in 30 seconds earlier this month, emboldening Aoki on his NFT trip’s silver-screen potential.      Investing in a pilot episode does not guarantee success for “Dominion X""; a distributor like Fox or Netflix would still have to buy the rights, and that’s hardly assured. But it's the first step on the road to broadcast, and it comes as networks like Fox place nine-figure bets on the intersection of NFTs and television.    Read more: Fox TV Puts $100M Behind Its NFT-Driven Blockchain Experiment    Aoki told CoinDesk he wholeheartedly believes that NFTs will be a “part of culture” within five years – TV culture included. Against that backdrop, the self-described “speculator” would naturally try to get a piece of the early action.      What makes a TV show an “NFT show” is far from clear; “Dominion X” is just one of two to make waves this month. The other, a star-studded animated series called “Stoner Cats,” can only be viewed by people who buy associated NFTs.      By contrast, the “level 1” of “Dominion X” can be watched by anyone with an internet connection. Its 500 NFTs are splices of the episode, not keys to the castle. Selling them on Nifty Gateway turned a quick but modest buck – Colon said it “barely covered” production costs.      “Ultimately the goal wasn’t to finance a television show as much as it was to show that there’s a market for original IP on the blockchain,” Colon said.    Read more: Vitalik Buterin Joins Cast of ‘Stoner Cats,’ Mila Kunis’ New Animated NFT Show    The first episode of Aoki’s super-meta metaverse show would certainly qualify as original blockchain IP: It’s basically an NFT of an NFT. (Aoki debuted the star character of “Dominion X” in his March NFT collaboration “Dream Catcher"" with digital artist Antoni Tudisco.)      “Dream Catcher” made millions as it showcased how Aoki’s star power (and more than a hint of market froth) could turn digital art into unusually large artist paydays. Its follow-up, an online-only TV episode, wasn't trying to top that so much as show the idea had legs.      The market responded with a load of fast cash on Aug. 2. Packs containing one of 10 scenes sold out within 30 seconds on Nifty, said Adam Bauer, a representative for Ether Cards, the startup that minted NFTs of the three-minute short.      Owners traded over $50,000 worth of “Dominion X” NFTs in the week that followed, Colon said, generating more revenue for Aoki and his team.

42424779,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWRlh,1629207000,State of Crypto: The Crypto Provision in the Infrastructure Bill Now Depends on Non-Crypto Issues,"The U.S. House of Representatives will start debating a bipartisan infrastructure bill next week, but Democrats are threatening to withhold their support for it for various reasons. This means the fate of a crypto tax provision might depend on whether another bill makes its way out of the Senate.    You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  (Endless) infrastructure week  The narrative    The Senate passed its version of the infrastructure bill to the House of Representatives last week. The House will return from its vacation next week to try and pass the bill. But while we may be focusing on the crypto tax provision within the proposed law, issues completely unrelated to crypto might determine if the bill is passed or whether the crypto language is modified.    Why it matters    The crypto industry pulled together to try and change the crypto tax provision in the infrastructure bill last week. This effort failed, and industry watchers are now looking to the House. But just as in the Senate, there will be politics around the bill that aren’t related to crypto.    Breaking it down    It seemed pretty crazy that a massive tax authority provision about crypto was included in a much-more-massive must-pass infrastructure bill. Now the bill is on its way to becoming law despite surprisingly unified opposition to the provision (I mean from both crypto advocates and some of the more skeptical voices in this industry). However, this bill might be headed to a similar fate in the House of Representatives.      We all know what happened last week, but here’s the short version: Despite an intense, week-long effort to change a questionable crypto tax provision in the Senate’s $1 trillion infrastructure bill (of which ~$550 billion is new spending), the Senate passed the original version of the language, which seeks to raise $28 billion over 10 years. The House of Representatives announced on Tuesday that it will cut its August recess short and return on Aug. 23 to consider the legislation.      I wrote a few weeks ago that Congress including crypto in its infrastructure package means lawmakers think the industry is robust enough to stick around for a while. Nevertheless, a lot of what happens with this bill will depend on politics outside of the crypto world.      The House of Representatives is currently controlled by the Democratic Party, with a very slim majority (220-212). That means if any Democrats vote against the bill or choose not to vote, the gap would have to be made up through votes from the Republican side, but who even knows how many Republicans might vote for the bill.      There is definitely division within the Democratic ranks on voting for the infrastructure bill, however. There is a group of progressive Democrats who are threatening not to vote for the bipartisan infrastructure bill unless the Senate passes a much larger $3.5 trillion package, which likely won’t happen until autumn.      However, a (smaller) group of more moderate Democrats are now threatening to vote against working on the larger package unless the House first passes the smaller, bipartisan bill.      I’m sure we’ll get more clarity about how this bill will progress after the House returns next week, but at least at the moment whether the bill passes at all, let alone with amendments to address industry concerns about the crypto provision, is very unclear.      Other real-world issues might also take precedence over the infrastructure bill negotiations. Lawmakers are going to react to the U.S. military’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the looming humanitarian crisis may be a priority for House representatives.      To be sure, there’s bipartisan opposition to the language of the crypto tax provision in the bill as it’s currently drafted. That’s not in dispute. Most recently, Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.), an influential Democratic lawmaker who represents parts of Silicon Valley, wrote an open letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) asking her to adopt an amendment introduced by Senators Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and supported by Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.).      Reps. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), Bill Foster (D-Ill.), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) and Darren Soto (D-Fla.) have also announced their support for changing the language.      It’s unclear to me, however, whether this type of support is enough for Congress to actually change the language. We saw this same sort of support in the Senate. But it didn’t count for much after Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) tried to attach his own amendment for military funding to the Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Warner-Sinema effort.      “Because there’s a difference of opinion on whether or not the Senator from Alabama should get a vote on his amendment, the body is refusing to take up an amendment that has broad bipartisan support, that we all know fixes something that badly needs to be fixed. This isn’t a whim of the Senator from Pennsylvania – there is nobody who disputes that there’s a problem here,” Toomey said in floor remarks after his push for unanimous consent failed.      Still, the House will be discussing the bill and this may include amendments. It’s not guaranteed at this point whether any amendments will be considered, but it’s worth maintaining an eye on it. We’ll be talking more about that as we get closer to the House’s return.    Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard    Bloomberg reported last week that President Joe Biden is considering nominating Acting CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam to a full term running the federal commodities regulator.

Polygon Merges With Hermez Network in $250M Deal: So Polygon, a layer 2 platform built on Ethereum, is absorbing Hermez Network, a different type of scaling solution. The developers who worked on Hermez will now work on this joint project. This appears to be the first full crypto-native merger between two decentralized network tools. It’s an interesting model.  NYDFS Head Lacewell to Depart Agency by Month’s End: NYDFS Superintendent Linda Lacewell will step down from the agency on Aug. 24, timing her exit with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s own departure from his office. Cuomo nominated Lacewell, a longtime aide to the governor, to head up New York’s financial regulator in 2019.  Outside CoinDesk:  (The New York Times) The New York Times’ Ezra Klein looked at the crypto industry following the Senate’s infrastructure bill fight. It’d be difficult to summarize this in two sentences so I’ll just say read the whole piece.  (The New York Times) “I decided to join the Pudgy Penguins because … well, it’s August and I’m bored,” wrote the Times’ Kevin Roose. Fair enough.

Rewards proportional to miners&apos; efforts are beneficial to the network because it ensures that even small-scale miners get rewarded. The method contrasts with most Proof-of-Work (PoW)-enabled blockchains that favor mining pools and users with extensive computational resources. What does a reward proportional to efforts mean? To understand how Jax.Network incentivizes miners proportional to their efforts; you need to know how a PoW consensus algorithm works. In a PoW-enabled blockchain, miners invest their time, effort, computational power, and electricity to solve a complex computational problem. Any node that successfully adds a block to the distributed ledger gets rewarded with new coins. In the case of Bitcoin, such a node receives 6.25 BTC (as of 2021). The intensity at which a node solves this computational problem is measured by the hashrate. For successful mining, miners have to attempt different combinations while solving the computational problem assigned with the block header, starting with a nonce of zero. The process continues with permutations and combinations until the target is achieved. Miners with extremely high hashrates have a better chance of reaching the target nonce sooner than others and, hence, receive higher rewards th...",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | WALLET,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/tHfgumto13DSz296IS8LBtaXKMm36c-X,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png

42424760,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWRDh,1629190496,Eqonex Launches Peer-to-Peer Crypto Lending Marketplace for Institutions,"Blockchain services firm Eqonex Group (formerly Diginex) has launched a peer-to-peer crypto lending marketplace that uses automated protocols.      Eqonex is targeting institutions that want more transparency than the over-the-counter (OTC) market provides but also don’t trust decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols that suffer from flash loans and hacks, Charlie Beach, Eqonex's chief risk officer and head of lending, said.      The institutional lending market is dominated by OTC desks that lack transparency over the interest rates charged on loans, Beach said.      “You’ve got a large number of firms that are operating through a fairly small number of dominant players like a bit of an oligopoly,” Beach said.      Several firms use loans to support trading strategies, and others use them to obtain working capital, such as bitcoin miners who want to keep their coins when bitcoin’s price is low, Beach added.      “If you look back to the reasons why people lend and borrow in the repo [repurchase agreement] or securities lending market, you’ll see some of the same use cases in crypto markets,” Beach said.      Crypto lending is a phenomenon that could potentially improve liquidity and price discovery for crypto assets. but it also has introduced systemic risks into the market. Eqonex will not be rehypothecating collateral and will charge a 1.3% fee annually, Beach added. (Rehypothecation is a practice whereby banks and brokers use, for their own purposes, assets that have been posted as collateral by their clients instead of keeping that collateral in cold storage.)    Read more: Bitcoin Hodlers Get a Lending Option With No KYC    Most loans that Eqonex plans to extend will probably be in the $1 million to $5 million or $5 million to $20 million range, Beach added.      “The range of the pipeline ranges from the low millions; probably the largest discussion has been around a $300 million three-year loan,” Beach said. “We’re seeing anything going out from a month to six months, but potentially even going out two to three years in the larger terms.”      Eqonex also plans to overcollateralize all loans on its platform.      “So, for example, a USDC loan backed by BTC would have an initial margin of 140% and the margin call would kick in at 120%,” Beach said. “A significant portion of the market is looking for that sort of safe type of product. Because an increasing number of loans in the market are less than 100% collateral basis or even zero collateral.”      Eqonex’s automated system also manages collateral, putting it in cold storage as soon as the principal of the loan is extended to the borrower. If the value of collateral hits the margin floor, then the platform automatically issues a margin call, Beach added. Borrowers have a 12-hour margin call window.      Eqonex extends terms on loans based on the amount of collateral that borrowers post and relies on its know-your-customer on-boarding process to weed out institutions that aren't creditworthy.      Having loans overcollateralized and not rehypothecating collateral will increase the comfort that institutions have with Eqonex’s lending platform, said Unchained Capital CEO Joseph Kelly who has no ties to Eqonex.      “Peer-to-peer marketplaces also tend to be challenged by consumer lending laws and consumer protection stuff, so it is easier to serve institutions with a peer-to-peer marketplace,” Kelly said.      Clients don't need to pre-fund loans or hold deposits on the platform. When a loan is matched, settlement instructions are automatically sent to the lender to send principal and to the borrower to send collateral. When both of these hit the platform, the principal is automatically sent to the borrower and the collateral into custody at Digivault, Eqonex’s custodian, which is registered with the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)      That automated workflow is “supported by our own lending ops team who are there to make sure that clients have received notifications to minimize the chances of them being liquidated,” Beach said. In the case of liquidation, Eqonex sells into the market either on exchanges, like Eqonex, or OTC liquidity providers.      Eqonex aims to have a loan book in the “hundreds of millions” by next year, Beach added. The peer-to-peer lending platform will be plugged into a prime services offering in the future, he said.      “There’s an increasing number of organizations that are keen to get involved in the crypto lending space,” Beach said. “You’re seeing everything from traditional banks that are forward thinking and interested in getting into crypto.You’re also seeing interest on the borrow and lend side from corporate treasuries.”",POSITIVE,BTC | USDC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | USDC,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/17/eqonex-launches-peer-to-peer-crypto-lending-marketplace-for-institutions,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

The round, which was led by PayPal founder Peter Thiel's Valar Ventures, values the company at $4.1 billion. It comes just months after a $170 million Series B funding round in March that valued the firm at $1.2 billion and made Bitpanda Austria's first-ever tech unicorn, which means a startup that's worth at least $1 billion.  The Vienna-based investment platform said it will use the fresh capital to double down on technology, international expansion and growth.

Technological evolution and social changes have a deeper and more direct effect on the financial industry than on most other sectors, for its basic raw materials are information and money. And money, in turn, can dematerialize and transform into accounting entries—in other words, into data that can be stored, processed, and transmitted in real-time and at costs so low that they are on the verge of disappearing altogether. This has brought about the need for innovations or better put disruptive innovations, which refers to the use of technology and other enhanced strategic operations to significantly affect the way the banking and financial institutions function and carry out their operations. With the fastest-growing consumer base for digital finance, Africa is gearing up to become a major hub for banking innovation. You can take advantage of this by joining key stakeholders in conversations that could shape the trajectory of the banking and financial services sector in Africa.

Aside from enabling DeFi participants to create on-chain digital assets representing assets and instruments in the real world, Horizon Protocol also allows its users to earn its native token (the HZN token) by staking and yield farming. The Horizon Staker dApp provides pools for PHB (Phoenix Global), HZN (Horizon), and an HZN-BNB liquidity pool token. Horizon Staker was integrated into Horizon Genesis in the July 23 launch, further incentivizing users to stake HZN to provide collateral in the system at even higher rewards. By building on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Horizon Protocol leverages the native BSC ecosystem while utilizing blockchain bridges such as PolyNetwork and Cosmos to facilitate cross-chain interoperability. In the future, with Horizon Exchange, any type of asset with a price feed will allow Horizon Protocol to provide users exposure to a synthetic variant on BSC, thereby removing the necessity to go through the difficulty and costs of transferring between multiple blockchains. Horizon Protocol Staking pools There are three staking pools available through the Horizon Staker platform, where users can stake HZN, PHB BEP-20, and HZN-BNB LP tokens to earn HZN tokens in the respective staking pools.
