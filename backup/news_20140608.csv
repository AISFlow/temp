42377348,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70MFV,1402228841,New York's Hester Street Fair Teams Up With BitPay for Weekly Bitcoin Market,"Hester Street Fair located in the heart of the Lower East Side is the largest pushcart market in New York City. Now in its fifth season, the market is dotted with 60 to 90 small businesses selling anything from artisanal food to vintage clothing to handmade arts and crafts.  Next weekend, like every other Sunday, the market will be up and buzzing, but with a twist in the tale.  Starting 15th June, more than 30 vendors at the Hester Street Fair will be trading their artisan goods for bitcoin every Sunday until the end of October. Over its four-month run, the 'NYC Bitcoin Fair’ will showcase special bitcoin events, and opportunities for newbies to learn more about digital currencies.  The NYC Bitcoin Fair is the brainchild of Suhyun Pak, one of the co-organisers of the Hester Street Fair, who told CoinDesk the fair is a great place to incubate regular bitcoin activity:  “The fair is the perfect environment for the use of bitcoin. The small businesses that vend at Hester Street Fair are very entrepreneurial and flexible and willing to try new things out. They aren't burdened by having to go up a chain of command for permissions to try things. They are also excited to be at the forefront of this new technology.”  Pak initially got introduced to bitcoin by Pat Che, who owns xCubicle, a tech and skill-share hackerspace located across the street from Hester. As an early adopter of bitcoin, Che also runs a meetup in New York and has been incubating the city’s bitcoin community since 2012.  Together they decided to field test the idea of a NYC Bitcoin Fair at one of Hester Street Fair’s December Christmas markets. The trial run wasn't a roaring success, will only about three vendors accepting bitcoin and the volume of transactions being low, to say the least. The initial transactions were also very clunky, as Pak admits. He said, “We were figuring it out as we went along.”  “We were new to it. It was really in its early stage for us. We didn’t have the support, the education, the workshops and that sort of thing.”  However, they did have one big transaction to boast of: $450 for a photograph.  Take two  Six months later they are back, and for a much longer run. Pak and his co-organisers are confident and more prepared this time around, he said:  “I think Bitcoin has come leaps and bounds since then, especially with the adoption by so many larger and more reputable companies.”  They have also partnered with payment processor BitPay to streamline the bitcoin acceptance process for the merchants.  Its Executive Chairman Tony Gallippi released the following statement regarding this partnership:  “We are so pleased with our new partnership with Hester Street Fair. It is another milestone for bitcoin. We are seeing it used in more brick and mortar outlets which is amazing to witness.”  Tony Gallippi will be speaking at CoinSummit in London on 10th-11th July.  After Party  The hosts have organised an after party at Rosette Restaurant to wrap up the opening weekend of the fair. The cash and bitcoin-accepting bar is offering a 25% discount on drinks to those who pay with digital currencies.  Charlie Shrem, who has been indicted on charges relating to anonymous online marketplace Silk Road and recently had his 24-hour house arrest lifted, will also be at the fair and joining the after party.

42377351,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70MJH,1402221927,If Digital Currencies Were Popular Technology Companies ...,"There's no doubt that the technology industry has made its presence in pop culture known loud and clear.  Gone are the days when only engineers and geeky hobbyists talked about using new software applications or gossiped about the most recent company acquisition.  Today, it's difficult to think of anyone in our social circles who doesn't use Facebook, and the mainstream media buzzed about the social networking giant’s recent acquisition of WhatsApp.  Technology companies have impacted the lives of almost everybody on the planet. Along the way, they have used their products, marketing campaigns and the power of branding to create their own distinct identities within the broader scope of pop culture's influence.  Though digital currencies may be relatively late to the party, they’re certainly making up for lost time. Thanks to the open source nature of the Bitcoin protocol, anyone with some time and programming experience can create their own uniquely branded digital currency.  Some of the biggest players in the digital currency space are already distinguishing themselves from others in the market using carefully crafted branding strategies.  Whether these currencies are modeling their marketing tactics after those of well-established tech companies or not, some similarities between digital currencies and our favorite technology companies are hard to deny.  ... Bitcoin would be Google  Just like how Google is the de facto search engine of choice for Internet users, a vast majority of people who use digital currencies are dealing with bitcoin.  Bitcoin and Google’s dominating popularity in their respective industries is not the only similarity between them, though.  Bitcoin has made it this far in part due to its open source development model, which allows developers to build applications that expand on the core protocol. Google has also taken a noticeably open approach to its development.  In contrast to competitor Apple, Google's Android operating system embraces open source development, which is why digital currency apps are only available for use on Android platforms — at least for now.  ... Litecoin would be Yahoo!  Litecoin was one of the first alternatives to bitcoin for digital currency enthusiasts. Though nearly identical to bitcoin, litecoin distinguished itself with a faster block time of 2.5 minutes (compared to the 10 minutes it takes on the Bitcoin protocol), and has even been declared the “silver to bitcoin’s gold”.  Though Yahoo! was around before Google, the veteran search engine has fallen behind Google in traffic rankings. In recent years, however, Yahoo! has revamped its marketing approach and has sought out expansion to new verticals, similar to litecoin’s quest to use branding to distinguish itself and gain market share from its titan rival.  Regardless of popularity, litecoin and Yahoo! have another similarity in their consistent reliability as an alternative option to their respective industry’s leader.  ... Ripple would be Uber  Ripple arrived on the digital currency scene and right away grabbed everybody's attention. Situating itself more as a payment protocol than an actual currency, Ripple was successful in disrupting the ecosystem of digital currencies that largely consisted of near clones of the Bitcoin protocol.  Ripple relies on mathematical algorithms and a consensus ledger for its protocol, and its decentralized nature has already proven to be disruptive in the world of traditional payment protocols.  Like Ripple, Uber made a loud entrance into the world of ridesharing and taxi services when it was founded in 2009. Uber used software to build an app that quickly proved to be disruptive to the taxicab industry.  Uber offers its users to all the same services of traditional taxis, but with a technologically advanced twist, just like Ripple’s approach to payment protocols.  ... Dogecoin would be Snapchat  Aside from bitcoin, dogecoin may be the most buzzed-about digital currency. Members of the dogecoin community are active, loyal, and vocal about their digital currency of choice. There is a lighthearted feel to the dogecoin movement, and supporters of the meme-inspired coin sometimes struggle to be taken seriously by other digital currency enthusiasts.  Similar to the story of dogecoin, few people expected Snapchat to become so popular in its early days. Both dogecoin and Snapchat have found considerable success, thanks in large part to their active user bases and the happy-go-lucky culture of their communities.  Selfie-taking teenage users of Snapchat also face some of the same problems of dogecoiners: they're the clear drivers behind their respective movements, but are still scoffed at by peers who consider themselves more mature.  ... Namecoin would be GoDaddy  Namecoin was one of the first digital currencies created with a specific purpose outside of the standard uses of bitcoin. Namecoin builds on the Bitcoin protocol to operate as a domain name system (DNS), but is novel in its decentralized approach to domain name registration.  Their utility as DNSs is possibly the only similarity between namecoin and GoDaddy. Namecoin solves many problems that plague centralized DNSs like GoDaddy; chief among them is the issue of domain name censorship.  Using namecoin, anyone can register a .bit domain outside of ICANN – Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers –control, which makes it much easier to avoid Internet censorship, with all of the authority lying in the hands of the peer-to-peer namecoin network.  ... Darkcoin would be Apple  Darkcoin made quite the splash when it was introduced to the public. The creators crafted darkcoin to have all the qualities that make bitcoin great, but with added functionality as a truly anonymous digital currency. Their hope is for darkcoin to become as ubiquitous as bitcoin, but to make sure that any and all transactions on the darkcoin blockchain can remain completely anonymous along the way.  If bitcoin is the Google of digital currencies, then darkcoin is certainly the Apple amongst its peers. Apple is notoriously opaque in their business operations, preferring to keep important decisions behind closed doors.  A prime example of Apple’s darkcoin-like ambiguity is the recent update to their policies regarding virtual currency apps in the App store:  “Apps may facilitate transmission of approved virtual currencies provided that they do so in compliance with all state and federal laws for the territories in which the app functions.”  While many speculate this may open the door for bitcoin apps to make their return to the App store, Apple never explicitly discloses what constitutes an “approved” virtual currency.  BONUS:  ... Ethereum would be Tesla  Even though Ethereum has not yet been officially introduced to the public, it's still one of the most talked about platforms in the digital currency space. In theory, Ethereum’s technology could be truly revolutionary to the Internet and beyond. It's easy to imagine an ethereum-fueled decentralized utopia, but even with all the hype, only time will tell if this product will be received by and adopted into society with open arms.  Replacing “ethereum” with “Tesla electric cars” and “digital currency/Internet” with “automotive industry/transportation” in the above paragraph makes a strong enough argument for the similarities between the two that any further explanation is superfluous.
