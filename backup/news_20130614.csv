First we had Firmcoins, and now we have the more established Trezor team taking pre-orders for its self-named Bitcoin wallet-cum-dongle.  There are two versions of the device. A plastic-encased model, set for a November 2013 release, sells for 1 BTC. That is followed by a brushed aluminum version which costs 3 BTC and is slated for an October 2013 release. Pre-ordering for either of the wallets is available through the Trezor eShop.  ""This Pre-Order allows you to purchase a TREZOR today and be among the first TREZOR owners when produced,"" the company's FAQ states. ""Please note, that the estimated delivery dates for each type of design might change. We are doing our best to be able to send you your TREZOR even earlier than announced.""  The company adds, ""Because our main goal is to support the Bitcoin economy, TREZOR is available only for bitcoins.""  Based in Prague, TREZOR is led by Marek Palatinus -- known in the Bitcoin community as ""slush"" (of the Slush Mining Pool) -- and Pavol Rusnak, or ""stick,"" who founded the Prague hackerspace.  Once ready, Trezor will be one of a variety of different methods of storing your bitcoins.  Update: You can now read our review of the Trezor wallet.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MINING | WALLET,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/14/trezor-now-taking-pre-orders-for-its-hardware-bitcoin-wallet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5ff5b29653b450626169a5e988a9532ffc5ff532-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376547,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AsUz,1371228068,Bitcoin in business: Buyer's Best Friend,"We talk with Adam Sah, founder and CEO of Buyer’s Best Friend and former Google employee.  Buyer’s Best Friend (BBF) is a retailer of artisanal food, high-end chocolates and gifts, sweet and healthy snacks. Since Sah founded the company in 2010, BBF has established three groceries in San Francisco: in the Ferry Building, North Beach and Haight-Ashbury. All three locations accept bitcoins, offer bitcoins in exchange for cash, and offer cash for bitcoins.  CoinDesk: We understand you are accepting bitcoin as a payment method. What are your other current payment methods? Are you open to the possibility of accepting other types of cryptocurrencies as well?  Adam Sah: We programmed our POS (point of sale) to accept bitcoins and also accept credit/debit (most popular), cash or check (almost nobody). Bitcoin is our favorite payment method – cash is a pain to count and handle, and credit cards charge large processing fees. Before we accept other cryptocurrencies, they would need to be as popular as bitcoin is with consumers.  CD: Why did you decide to accept bitcoins? Was it because you or an influential person in your company is a personal enthusiast, did a customer request it, or were you targeting bitcoin users?  Sah: We’re a young business and wanted to find ways to attract new customers. I'm a techie and heard about the growing community of bitcoin users, and also saw there were online directories such as bitcoin.travel and localbitcoins.com where you can connect with them. To me, that's all you need.  CD: How long have you been accepting bitcoins?  Sah: About a month.  CD: How exactly does your business do a bitcoin transaction? Is there any specific app or wallet that you prefer to use? Can transactions be immediately confirmed, or is there a lag time?  Sah: We confirm transactions immediately and let the customers move on – there are better hacks than stealing chocolate. It can take an hour to fully confirm a bitcoin transaction, which sure beats credit cards that take 30-60 days to fully confirm.  We recommend wallet apps from Coinbase, BitPay,and Blockchain.info, but most wallets work fine for us. I'm excited to test new paper bitcoins, and carry them as notes in the stores so our customers can buy them with cash.  CD: What exchange rate do you offer? What is this based on?  Sah: BFF changes bitcoin at the 24 hours’ average posted on Blockchain.info – we make our money by selling product, not pretending to be a bank.  We also offer two other services: “bitcoin back” from cash purchases and “cash back from bitcoin purchases,” both integrated with the POS. Bitcoin back means you can acquire bitcoins at the store with any purchase (we limit to around 1 BTC). Cash back means you can use BBF to exchange excess BTC you might have – this is limited to whatever cash we have on hand, which is rarely more than $200. Both are done at the posted exchange rate with no markup.  CD: How many customers are taking advantage of your acceptance of bitcoins?  Sah: It’s a small but influential percentage, and they're new customers -- probably one customer per day or so. Surprisingly, the bitcoiners have been very normal, average customers – neither going bananas (as we’d hoped) nor buying one tiny item (as we feared).  CD: What challenges have you faced when using bitcoins?  Sah: The only interesting challenge was one of software compatibility – QR codes don’t work well with all applications, and sometimes we have to switch payment methods, either BBF emailing a request for payment, or customers proactively emailing us the BTC. This slows down the checkout process.  CD: What do you feel the pros and cons of using bitcoins have been for you and your business? Has it been worthwhile for you?  Sah: It’s been great – so easy that I wasn’t even present for our first transaction, one of our staff just did it. It was no big deal either – they simply followed the instructions on the screen.  CD: What do you feel bitcoin needs to do in order to receive more widespread adoption?  Sah: The same things the experts are saying: higher global transaction rates, address deflation and hoarding, think through anonymity and the public chain, etc. Robert Macmillan of Wired wrote a nice piece about us, pondering the question of anonymity given the public transaction history.  I’d add that consumers need a reason to switch to cryptocurrencies from credit cards, which continue to outpace debit cards and AmEx because they help consumers manage the timing of their cash flows, provide an ombudsman service for disputes, and offer rewards.  CD: Do you feel bitcoin is here to stay?  Sah: Yes – I’ve been working in Silicon Valley for 20 years (and) have seen many trends, such as the rise of the web when Mosaic launched. I believe bitcoin has that kind of momentum, because it solves real, practical problems – lower transaction costs, independence from politically motivated government policies, increased security, and more. As a business operator, I think the lower transaction costs are a very big deal too.  CD: Is there anything else you'd like to say about bitcoin?  Sah: It's been a great experience – the bitcoiners are blown away that we handle bitcoin as easily as cash and credit card. There are no flashing lights, no fancy anything, it just works. And, it lets us get back to our passion, which is introducing people to amazing food.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Mary Ernst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/14/bitcoin-in-business-buyers-best-friend,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/edf27ef825380268db81edce97583f1d79dd007d-1600x1195.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376546,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AsPx,1371223814,A grave case of spooks,"Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 14th June 2013 — a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.  No secret  The whole world had to pretend to be shocked this week when it was revealed that American spies had been spying. Edward Snowden, a system administrator, popped up in Hong Kong clutching a few Powerpoint slides he’d been given while contracting at the National Security Agency. From this, everyone learned that the NSA was routinely collecting data from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and so on, as part of a mysterious programme called PRISM. Things like search terms, email addresses and web browsing were being scooped up and carefully cross-checked for signs of naughtiness.  The spooks reacted accordingly, claiming that if anyone ever found out that the NSA had an Internet account, untold damage would result. Some collateral misery did indeed result, with bitcoin prices dropping twenty dollars or so as it dawned on some cryptocurrency fans that if you do interesting things on a global public network, not everybody will politely look the other way. Others took the opportunity to buy up cheap BTC and normality soon resumed.  John Law is delighted by all this for a number of reasons, and not just because someone’s finally found a use for Microsoft Bing. It does no harm whatsoever to turn over a few stones and see what lives beneath; those who really do have things to hide from the security services tend to be perfectly well informed about what not to do online, and if the mighty machineries of state secrecy can be compromised by a twenty-something geek with a USB key, it’s as well that we all know this before giving them yet more power.  Some decent legal oversight would be nice. American spooks aren’t allowed to tap into American citizens’ messages without explicit legal permission; British spooks have similar restrictions on UK nationals. But they can both do what they like with foreigners - to wit, Brits on American systems and Yanks over here. Of course, neither side then asks the other what they found out - that would be cheating - but since both sides know perfectly well what the other is interested in and can share without being asked, there’s no need.  This sort of thing has been going on for exactly seventy years. BRUSA - a British/USA agreement on espionage co-operatiion, was signed in 1943, merely the first in a series of mutually advantageous pacts that have survived the ending of the Cold War and thrived thanks to the War on Terror and the invention of the search engine. That’s not going to change any time soon, and you can bet your bottom bitcoin that anything that happens online gets sampled, classified and reported on by men in bad suits behind anonymous doors.  Assume that and arrange your affairs accordingly, but don’t panic. 007 probably has other things on his mind.  Knocking the blocks off  Talking of British online activities, do keep an eye on Feathercoin, an open source cryptocurrency from Oxfordshire. Unlike BTC, its founder is not only open about his identity - stand up Peter Bushnell - but happy to give interviews in which, with typical English understatement, he desribes the creation and maintenance of a brand-new currency as a hobby.  Feathercoin is a good sign of how cryptocurrencies are evolving. It’s designed to be minable by people who don’t want to invest in ever more powerful custom rigs, while retaining the right level of difficulty to maintain its value as more sign up. It’s undergoing - and surviving - determined attacks by parties unknown, who probe its weaknesses, break up the blockchain and keep Bushnell agreeably busy. And as it’s entirely open source, its community base can chip in and help make it more robust and trustworthy.  As with so many aspects of the current state of the art, the single most important fact is that evolution like this is going on. What Bushnell is doing isn’t in competition with established financial and technology organisations, it’s creating something they cannot - imagine anyone within Microsoft or HSBC trying to get permission for a currency project that didn’t directly benefit or remain under the control of the company. Yet that level of independence is necessary for any general-purpose currency to catch on: the big guys just can’t play.  As one of a number of new cryptocurrencies, Feathercoin may or may not have the chops to survive and prosper. Bushnell says that there’s room for lots of different coinage, and he’s undoubtedly right. Indeed, with no shortage of interest and expertise on tap, it’s increasingly unthinkable that there’s any way to stop this happening. Gentlemen and ladies, place your bets.  Hatching, matching and dispatching  The more elderly among you may remember those far-off days of decent summers and no Internet. Then Tim Berners-Lee invented the Web, which was so simple to use and understand that even journalists could work out something was happening. The stories duly followed - you could download naughty pictures! Meet people you didn’t already know! And date them!  Much the same is now happening to online currencies. Having got its head around the complex idea that a set of data can be as useful as a lump of metal when it comes to exchanging value, the mainstream media is hungry for anything involving sex, babies and Bitcoin. This week delivered on all fronts, with a pair of to-be-weds deciding to live their first few blissful days of couplehood entirely on BTC, and the unveiling of a baby whose existence was due to fertility treatment paid for by - ah, you’ve guessed it.  With those two rites of passage in place, John Law couldn’t help but go looking to see if the final part of the puzzle was in place - had anyone been buried thanks to Bitcoin? It turns out that, yes, of course they had. For the sake of journalistic integrity, it should be noted that this is a Reddit story with no way to verify the claims, and if you’re of a sensitive disposition you shouldn’t read the comments. But even if it isn’t true, it should be - which seems to be the main qualification for so much online news these days anyway.  It’s not clear how long this phase will last, with the mere combination of Bitcoin and daily life noteworthy enough to merit column inches. Before it’s over, expect stories of kids getting their pocket money, prostitutes accepting payment and court fines settled, all in crypto-cash. (Hopefully, not all involving the same person.)  When such stories stop coming, you’ll know that another milestone’s been reached. Meanwhile, if you fancy some free publicity and can think up some normal activity that’s yet to be paid for by virtual dosh, an eager world awaits.  John Law  is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler. Having reformed the French economy, invented paper currency, state banks, the Mississippi Bubble and other ideas essential to modern economics, he took three hundred years off in a small cottage outside Bude. He has returned to write for CoinDesk on the foibles of digital currency.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION,John Law,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/14/a-grave-case-of-spooks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7eb9a5e5872daf374ac44b5f912f924531a162d4-1000x665.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376534,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AsEd,1371216332,Firmcoin - a new physical form of bitcoin,"The most notable thing about digital currencies are that they rarely exist in the real world. Instead they are stored as data in computers or smartphones. Firmcoin is a new project that is attempting to create tamper-proof cards that can hold an arbitrary amount of BTC and will be scannable via NFC.  The project was announced on the Bittalk forums by user Sergio_Demian_Lerner, who is from the company behind the idea, Certimix. The so-called Firmcoin is intended to be cheap enough (they hope as little as $5 USD) to be physically given to a payee just like any other 'real world' currency.  Here is an excerpt from the announcement:    When requested, a Firmcoin will send you its Bitcoin private key, but will automatically and atomically wipe the private key from memory, preventing double-spends.      There are several ways to verify the authenticity of a Firmcoin. For low value payments, you can just query the device if it has funds or not. Also the device can cryptographically prove that it is holding a certain private key, by signing user provided messages (but not transactions!)    If you want to verify the authenticity of a Firmcoin with more confidence, you must have connected to the Bitcoin network in the last 24 hours in order to download the list of Firmcoin addresses with funds. The Firmcoin can only receive funds if the transactions that load the funds are 24 hours old.    Carrying this small database, you can check the full validity of a Firmcoin without being online!    Of course, when dealing with any physical currency the problem of forgeries presents itself. Certimix claims it will be able to prevent this. It says you will be able to ""download a physical description of random features of each manufactured token and check its physical authenticity by just taking a photo of the Firmcoin.""  As for the software stored on the card that will manage transactions, Certimix have posted a long technical document on how it can protect firmware authenticity and defeat attempts to put malicious code onto a Firmcoin.  We've seen physical bitcoins before with Casascius coins and BitBills, but Certmix has this to say about its competition:  Firmcoins are a new kind of currency. They can work as Casascius coins or Bitbills, but they are reusable. You can load funds in a Firmcoin as if it were an hardware wallet, such as Trezor, and at any time you can unload the funds. Also you can check if a Firmcoin has associated funds by querying the device. A Firmcoin proof [sic] it is has a private key, without revealing it.  The technology behind Firmcoin is said to be open, however, there are elements which Certimax admit are patent pending.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | WALLET,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/14/firmcoin-a-new-physical-form-of-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/167cba51ae07d2eb36c912ffacf07df288b558b6-419x266.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376532,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AsC7,1371209442,New prepaid credit card funded by bitcoins,"Prepaid credit cards are not new. However, a prepaid credit card that can be funded with bitcoins is. The BitcoinCard is a credit card that can be funded via BTC.

42376551,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AsWF,1371200453,Colored coins paint sophisticated future for Bitcoin,"Bitcoin is a useful way to exchange money, but what if you could do other things with it? If bitcoiners could use it to issue shares, bonds and IOUs, or even to create alternative currencies atop bitcoins, they could add even more value to this innovative cryptocurrency. Bitcoinx, a community wanting to ""democratize finance,"" is hoping to facilitate just that, with a concept called ""colored coins"".  Colored coins is a concept designed to be layered on top of Bitcoin, creating a new set of information about coins being exchanged. Using colored coins, bitcoins could be ""colored"" with specific attributes. This effectively turns them into tokens, which can be used to represent anything.  “It's a distributed asset management infrastructure that leverages the Bitcoin infrastructure, allowing individuals and companies to issue various asset classes,” says Ron Gross, an Israeli programmer and active member of the bitcoin community, who was involved in the early stages of the colored coins project.  “The issued assets can then be traded between users without relying on a central authority. All the relevant advantages of Bitcoin apply (your account cannot be frozen, no middleman, cheap transactions).”  In a whitepaper (still in progress) on the subject, another contributor, Meni Rosenfeld, describes a variety of applications. Colored coins can be used to represent physical assets, such as a house or car. They could stand in for financial instruments such as stocks or bonds, or even interest-bearing assets. How about an IOU? Smartcoins open the way for credit infrastructures built on Bitcoin.  There are challenges for colored coins, however. One came in the form of a patch to the Bitcoin protocol, announced in early April. The ""anti-dust"" patch, as it has become known, imposed a minimum size on any output in a bitcoin transaction. An output is a unit in a bitcoin transaction that defines the new owner, and the amount of bitcoins that he or she receives. In the new setup, any amount fewer than 5,430 satoshis (0.0000543 bitcoins) is disregarded. The developers made this patch to stop people from stuffing the blockchain with lots of microscopic transactions.  While 5,430 satoshis may seem small, colored coins works best with far more granular transactions than this. The patch was a setback for the project. “Colored coins can still work more-or-less fine even with these drawbacks, but now people say we should redesign (the) coloring scheme,” says Alex Mizrahi, who heads the colored coins project. “There are several proposals, but this is just a major slowdown.”  What would it take to get the Bitcoin community using colored coins? Much depends on whether we're talking about native support at the protocol level, or add-on, ""floating"" support in bitcoin clients.  Native support will help with the performance of thin clients (client-server versions that don't store entire copies of the blockchain), says Mizrahi. “I believe it is very unlikely. Bitcoin does not welcome new features, from what I can tell.”  He expects native colored coin support in an altcurrency before bitcoin. However, the major Scrypt-based currencies aren't looking at it. “We may look into providing some color coin implementation directly in the Litecoin protocol, but nothing is planned right now,“ said Litecoin creator Charles Lee.  Neither is Feathercoin, another Scrypt-based altcoin based on Litecoin. Founder Peter Bushnell said that he has his hands busy at the moment, after fending off a massive 51-percent attack earlier in June. “We are busy enough right now and find ourselves at a crossroads. This is the sort of thing I would like to look into at some point later on,” he says.  But the creator of another SHA-256 currency – Freicoin - is very interested in a variation on colored coins. It is perhaps no wonder that Mark Friedenbach is enthusiastic about the idea. After all, he wants to rewrite the rules of usury with his currency.  Building a colored coins technology that is binary-compatible with Bitcoin will be problematic, he asserts, because of what he describes as high transaction fees. “We came up with a proposal that achieves everything that people want from colored coins. We will implement those on Freicoin, and then let Freicoin be basically the medium for exchanging credit and IOUs in the same way that Bitcoin is for exchanging hard cash.”  He says that the specification is almost finished, and that he is working to get it peer reviewed. “As soon as we deploy Freicoin assets, we’ll be hitting the scaling of Bitcoin,” says Friedenbach. He’d better prepare himself, then, as he wants his version of colored coins – called Freicoin Assets – out by Christmas.  But Bitcoin could see its own implementation in the form of a floating set of specifications that can be implemented in third-party bitcoin clients, rather than in the protocol itself. The good news is that, unlike some other services such as anonymity, colored coins don’t explicitly need integrating into the protocol, says TamásBlummer, CEO of Bits Of Proof. His company produces an open-source, enterprise-class Bitcoin server that he says can already propagate colored coins.  “Colored coins is a logical layer above the core Bitcoin protocol,” says Blummer. “I believe that it should not need changes, only extensions.” He aims to have a color-aware wallet by the autumn, and says that a supporting infrastructure for transactions could be reality by the end of the year.  In fact, clients are already available. Mizrahi and his colleagues produced a version of the Armory client capable of handling P2P colored coin transactions in January of this year. Then, realizing that colored coins added a processing burden to an already resource-hungry client, he produced a web-based client instead: WebcoinX.  Part of the problem with implementing colored coins, says Mizrahi, is getting developers to work on it. Gross agrees. “Unlike Bitcoin, a clear path to monetize the colored coin infrastructure hasn't emerged yet. So, there is relatively little incentive for people for work on colored coin projects,” he says. “As a result, Ripple.com, a direct competitor, has gained significant market share. Ripple.com solves very similar problems to colored coins.”  Like colored coins, Ripple is designed to facilitate credit structures in the world of math-based currencies. But Ripple is based on its own currency, XRP, and is also still currently controlled by a holding company, putting it in direct opposition to the decentralized ethos underpinning Bitcoin.  There are other issues. Any credit-based mechanism in colored coins would have to involve an element of trust. In colored coins, the trust would have to happen ""out of band,"" using a separate system.  “I believe we'll see some infrastructure around it. Something like rating agencies, which will audit companies that issue stocks, bonds and currencies based on colored coins,” says Mizrahi. Such third-party systems would verify assets.  “Of course, it is completely decentralized, and potentially such agencies will compete with each other. We are going to offer some support for this on an 'asset-definition' level,” he says.  Ratings agencies? Stocks? Bonds? Futures trading? All of this begins to sound suspiciously regulatory, doesn’t it? The Bitcoin community is still in a world of pain thanks to regulatory tensions over issues such as whether an exchange is a money services business. Now, bitcoinX is proposing a decentralized way to create complex financial instruments while dispensing with those pesky anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-client (KYC) rules.  If colored coins enable people to trade bitcoins as a placeholder for anything, they could land us in a world of trouble with already nervous governments. When bitcoins and stock trading have mixed in the past, things haven’t gone well. Remember the Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange?  “Tensions are unavoidable and will be even more severe here,” agrees Blummer. “I believe that Bitcoin has to work itself up the food chain, first targeting areas like crowd-funding before we attempt to ‘attack’ clearinghouses of stocks.”  Colored coins have a long way to go, but there is significant interest in making this work. David Johnston, the executive director of altcurrency investment network BitAngels, is interested in the concept.  The will and the technology is there. If Bitcoin is to get beyond the mundanities of mining, and turn into something more sophisticated, it needs this. The question is, who will use it first? As Blummer says: “Bitcoin is cash. With colored coin, you get the rest.”",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | LTC,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/14/colored-coins-paint-sophisticated-future-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/462147b670c24bbf6d5f651f9e8babe96ca64e0b-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376553,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AsXV,1371193253,"Bitcoin100's dilemma: Too many bitcoins, not enough charity","Dmitry Murashchik is faced with quite the problem. He's sitting on more than $30,000 (US) in bitcoins, just waiting to dole them out, but everyone thinks he's a snake-oil salesman.  Perhaps it's because he's dealing in bitcoins, and public perception of the crytpocurrency is still shaky. Or perhaps it just sounds too good to be true.  Murashchik is the treasurer for Bitcoin100, an organization dating back to November 2011 that aims to donate $1,000 worth of bitcoins to various charities. As a volunteer — all members of the group are — he's tasked with a number of responsibilities, from overseeing a website relaunch to finding beneficiaries to donate to. The latter has been proving especially challenging.  ""It's like you beg people: Please take my $1,000. It'll be very quick and easy,"" Murashchik said.  To prove that Bitcoin100 isn't a fraudulent scheme, he said all transactions in and out of the charity are publicly visible.  ""Any unauthorized expense will be instantly seen by everyone,"" he added. ""We can't funnel money to personal expenses or hide it through accounting shenanigans, like some shady charities have gotten accused of before. Being able to easily verify and keep tabs on an organization that chooses to be public, without needing to necessarily trust the people behind it, is another benefit of bitcoin.""  When Bitcoin100 was created, the idea was to donate 100 bitcoins per charity. But back then, 100 bitcoins were worth roughly $1,000. As of this writing, it's up an order of magnitude, closer to $10,000.  ""Since bitcoin has gone up in price, we switched to $1,000 instead of 100 bitcoin(s) per donation,"" Murashchik said. ""I guess we'll keep giving out money until we don't have any more.""  To date, Bitcoin100 has received close to 1,600 bitcoins from about 110 donors. Though the organization originally asked for pledges, many contributors ended up donating directly to the group's fund, giving Bitcoin100 the discretion to distribute to charities on behalf of donors.  Beneficiaries include BUND Berlin e.V., a conservation group in Germany; Group B Strep International, which promotes awareness of the bacteria that affects pregnant women and infants; and My Refuge House, an organization that runs a safe house in the Philippines for sex-abuse survivors and sex workers. On Friday, Bitcoin100 added three more to the growing list: the news source antiwar.com; The Fessler Foundation, which funds spinal cord research; and Songs of Love, which creates personalized songs for children facing medical, physical or emotional challenges.  ""There are so many advantages to accepting donations in bitcoin,"" said Stephanie Murphy, director of operations at Fr33 Aid, which provides supplies to medical skilled volunteers and offers educational health programs. ""It is easier to start accepting bitcoin — just post an address — than to set up bank accounts, PayPal and other legacy banking system options. I think this lowers the barrier for starting charities and non-profit organizations because they can focus on their mission rather than dealing with banking hassles.""  Fr33 Aid's account was locked by PayPal twice, she noted. ""Both times, it was difficult to get in touch with an actual person, and the reasons for locking us down were not clear.""  Murashchik added that charities have incentive to receive donations in bitcoins because there aren't transaction fees and the digital currency is accepted globally. Furthermore, bitcoin doesn't encounter the same chargeback issues associated with credit-card fraud. Increasingly, identity thieves are using stolen credit cards to donate to charities ""as a nice gesture,"" he said. But when a credit-card company investigates fraudulent charges, it will pull those funds and levy an additional fee on the merchant ... in this case the charity.  Because Bitcoin100's donor base is so varied, the group avoids donating to political or religious groups. The charities, which volunteers bring on board, go through a vetting process to ensure they are in fact legitimate. After that, money is sent via BitPay.  Noble as its goal might be, the organization's mission has always been to promote Bitcoin.  ""The main purpose is to spread awareness of bitcoin and the benefits of bitcoin,"" Murashchik said. ""We're focused on getting as many charities as possible.""  Still, supporters of Bitcoin100, some of whom have profited greatly from the currency's boom in value, have continued to pay it forward.  ""Many of the charities we've converted (to accept bitcoin) have continued to receive donations, with members sending a few extra bucks here and there,"" he added.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | TRADING | RESEARCH,Alice Truong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/14/bitcoin100s-dilemma-too-many-bitcoins-not-enough-charity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a59696e41846199d87b6991fd9e8bdd64a9f9f7-628x356.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
