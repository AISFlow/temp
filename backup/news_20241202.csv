37154755,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315437,1733183994,Bitcoin Dip Fuels Institutional Appetite: Can Today’s Huge Buys Push the Price to $100K in December?,"Several major companies recently invested heavily in Bitcoin despite a price dip, raising questions about the cryptocurrency’s potential to reach $100k by December. These big investments across various sectors signal continued institutional interest in Bitcoin, even as market volatility persists. From software intelligence firms to educational platforms, the influx of capital into the Bitcoin market suggests a bullish sentiment despite the recent price dip. Bitcoin Price Fluctuations Attract Institutional Investors On December 2, MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm known for its Bitcoin investments, disclosed another substantial purchase. According to a Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company acquired 15,400 BTC for roughly $1.5 billion in cash, paying an average price of $95,976 per Bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses. This acquisition adds to MicroStrategy’s already considerable Bitcoin holdings, underscoring the company’s continued confidence in the cryptocurrency. For the quarter, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin return reached 38.7%, while its year-to-date return sits at 63.3%. MicroStrategy has acquired 15,400 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$95,976 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 38.7% QTD and 63.3% YTD. As of 12/2/2024, we hodl 402,100 $BTC acquired for ~$23.4 billion at ~$58,263 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/K3TK4msGp0 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 2, 2024 Simultaneously, MARA Holdings, a company operating in the digital asset and blockchain computing industry, revealed its plan to secure $805 million by issuing convertible senior notes due in 2031. This capital raise seeks to bolster the company’s Bitcoin reserves and address existing debt. MARA intends to allocate up to $199 million to buy back a portion of its convertible notes maturing in 2026, utilizing the remaining funds to increase its Bitcoin holdings and support general corporate activities. $100k Bitcoin Price: A December Dream? Further fueling the Bitcoin market, Genius Group Limited, an AI-driven education company embracing a “Bitcoin-first” approach, announced on Monday that it had added $1.8 million to its Bitcoin treasury. The latest purchase raises the company’s total Bitcoin reserves to 172 BTC, valued at $15.8 million, with an average net price of $92,006 per Bitcoin. This investment follows Genius Group’s recent commitment to hold at least 90% of its current and future reserves in Bitcoin, aiming to accumulate $120 million worth of the cryptocurrency. Adding to the wave of Bitcoin acquisitions, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet unveiled a shareholder reward program on Monday, offering Bitcoin prizes through a lottery system. Shareholders owning a minimum of 100 shares by December 31 are eligible for the program, which boasts a total prize pool of 30 million yen (approximately $199,500) in Bitcoin. Metaplanet has seen its stock soar by 1,000% in 2024, becoming Tokyo's top stock through its partnership with Sora Ventures and adopting Bitcoin as part of its treasury strategy, showcasing the potential advantages of integrating Bitcoin into corporate finance. #Metaplanet … — Vanquish Adept (@VanquishAdept) December 2, 2024 The rewards, distributed via lottery, will be allocated to 2,350 shareholders in varying amounts. In addition, new accounts opened with SBI VC Trade between November 18th and March 31st, 2025, can participate by registering through a dedicated website before the deadline. Bitcoin Price Predictions: Institutional Influence on the Horizon Bitcoin’s price has experienced substantial fluctuations recently, with a considerable increase of approximately 40% following Trump’s U.S. presidential victory in November. The question now is whether the investments by companies like MicroStrategy, Metaplanet, MARA Holdings, and Genius Group, amid a Bitcoin price dip, can provide the necessary momentum to propel the Bitcoin price towards this ambitious target in December. The current market dynamics, driven by massive investments from established and emerging players, suggest a potential upward trajectory for the Bitcoin price. With the $100k target in sight, the influence of institutional buying on the future of Bitcoin remains a topic of keen observation. The combined efforts of these major players create a new wave of investment, potentially signaling a bullish trend for Bitcoin despite the recent price fluctuation.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/mr-chill-doge-solana-memecoin-to-surge-14000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Is it the innovation it brings to blockchain, its potential to solve real-world problems, or the jaw-dropping returns it could offer? With the crypto space brimming with opportunities, finding the best altcoin to buy in December 2024 can feel like striking gold. While Arbitrum has been gaining traction with its Layer-2 scalability and EOS continues to innovate with its smart contract capabilities, Qubetics ($TICS) is redefining what’s possible in crypto payments and asset management. Let’s dive into why these three projects deserve your consideration. Qubetics ($TICS) Redefines Crypto Payments And Asset Management Qubetics is making cryptocurrency more accessible with its multi-chain wallet, an advanced application designed for users to manage digital assets with ease. The wallet is not just a storage space; it’s an all-in-one platform for debit and virtual card integration, and compatibility with payment giants like Apple Pay and Google Pay. With a decentralised VPN service and a tokenised asset marketplace, the Qubetics wallet is turning heads for its practical applications. The multi-chain wallet’s real-world utility is unmatched. A small business owner, for example, could use Qubetics to manage payments without worrying about high transaction fees. Imagine a local café offering its customers a way to pay with $TICS using the wallet’s integration with Visa or Mastercard. The business owner can instantly convert the tokens into stablecoins like USDT or USDC, providing reliable fiat currency payouts while bypassing crypto volatility. For developers, Qubetics simplifies blockchain interaction with its innovative design. Whether creating decentralised marketplaces or managing NFT royalties, the wallet streamlines every process. Even for artists, the ability to tokenise artwork and earn royalties every time their piece is resold is groundbreaking. The marketplace within the wallet also allows users to explore tokenised real-world assets like real estate and commodities, providing diversification opportunities that were once limited to institutional investors. The wallet’s accessibility across iOS, Android, and desktop platforms ensures users can manage their $TICS tokens and other digital assets anywhere. For a closer look at its features, watch this informatve video . The Qubetics Presale Opportunity The Qubetics presale continues to attract attention with its 11th stage already underway. Over 259 million $TICS tokens have been sold to more than 5,700 holders, raising an impressive $4.1 million. At the current price of $0.0282 per token, investors have a chance to lock in before the price increases by 10% in the next stage. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering a return of 783%. Investing in $TICS now could lead to life-changing returns. A $4,000 investment today would be worth $35,460 if the token reaches $0.25. Analysts forecast $TICS climbing to $1 post-presale, turning that investment into $137,450. Long-term projections indicate the token could hit $5, translating to $702,835, and at $15 after the mainnet launch, an astounding $2.1 million. These potential returns showcase why Qubetics is being recognised as one of the best altcoins to buy in December 2024. Arbitrum Strengthens Its Lead In Layer-2 Solutions Arbitrum is setting new benchmarks in blockchain scalability. Designed as a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum, it handles transactions off-chain to reduce congestion and costs. This makes it ideal for decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms, NFT marketplaces, and developers looking for a reliable ecosystem. Recent updates reveal that Arbitrum has processed over 1 billion transactions, highlighting its growing adoption among developers and businesses. The introduction of streamlined deployment tools for smart contracts has further solidified its reputation as a preferred platform for blockchain applications. Arbitrum’s real-world relevance lies in its ability to cut costs and speed up transactions. DeFi platforms using Arbitrum can now process trades at a fraction of the cost, which is a game-changer for investors looking for efficiency. NFT marketplaces have also benefited from the platform’s ability to handle large volumes of transactions without slowing down. Analysts believe that as more projects migrate to Layer-2 solutions, the value of Arbitrum’s token, ARB, is likely to grow. With its innovative technology and growing user base, Arbitrum is clearly one of the best altcoins to buy in December 2024 , particularly for those eyeing long-term scalability. EOS Continues To Innovate With Smart Contracts EOS has long been a key player in blockchain development, and recent upgrades have brought it back into the spotlight. Known for its focus on high performance and user-friendly interfaces, EOS remains a go-to platform for developers building decentralised applications (dApps). The latest Antelope protocol upgrade has boosted EOS’s scalability and security, making it even more appealing to developers. Reports indicate that the daily user count on EOS has grown by 18% over the past month, thanks to partnerships with gaming and DeFi platforms. EOS’s low transaction fees and fast processing speeds make it a practical choice for both developers and users. Imagine a gaming company creating a decentralised in-game economy on EOS without worrying about lag or high network costs. Similarly, financial institutions using EOS for DeFi applications can process loans and trades with near-instantaneous speeds. With its ongoing focus on innovation, EOS is well-positioned to attract more developers and investors. Its continued evolution makes it one of the best altcoins to buy in December 2024, especially for those looking for a platform that combines performance with reliability. Conclusion Whether you’re looking for scalability, smart contract innovation, or real-world usability, Qubetics ($TICS), Arbitrum, and EOS each bring something unique to the table. Arbitrum leads the charge in Layer-2 solutions, while EOS continues to refine its developer-friendly ecosystem. However, Qubetics stands out for its multi-chain wallet, blending innovation and practicality with a user-focused design. Its presale offers unmatched potential, with the opportunity to turn modest investments into life-changing returns. If you’re searching for the best altcoin to buy in December 2024 , Qubetics should be at the top of your list.

After weeks of bitter standoffs, the National Assembly has finally agreed to vote in favor of a government-proposed bill that will see crypto tax launch in 2027 , rather than January 2025. Crypto-related Stocks: Buoyed by National Assembly News Gangwondomin Ilbo reported that crypto-related stock prices “rose in tandem” on the morning of December 2, reacting to developments over the weekend. Hanwha Investment & Securities share prices over the past five days on the Korea Exchange.

Hanwha Investment & Securities, which owns shares in Dunamu, the operator of the Upbit crypto exchange , saw prices spike upwards as soon as the Korean Exchange opened on December 2. Both Hanwha Investment & Securities and Hanwha Investment & Securities Preferred Stock prices rose by 8% and 11% respectively.

When Will a Crypto Firm Debut on the Korea Exchange? As of yet, no South Korean crypto firm has successfully floated on the Korea Exchange. Bithumb this year shelved its IPO bid in favor of a move to list on US markets. The Upbit partner K Bank was also forced to pull the plug on its own IPO bid recently. However, the company claims it may return for a third bid to go public early next year. On December 1, Democratic Party lawmakers – representing the largest political bloc in the National Assembly – caved in to government demands to delay crypto tax. The Democratic Party had created a bill that instead suggested raising the annual threshold for crypto tax to parity with stock exchange investment. However, the DP conceded defeat after the bill failed to pass the subcommittee phase.

37153296,https://crypto.news/?p=14315594,1733181888,Ethereum recorded an inflow of $2.2 billion this year,"The second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, Ethereum, has seen a major inflow from the financial market, with a total of $2.2 billion this year. According to CoinShare’s published report on Dec. 02, Ethereum ( ETH ) has an outstanding record, along with Bitcoin as the most prominent crypto in the world, receiving a large amount of inflow this year. Ethereum has gained market attention with funding of about $2.2 billion. This is a new record that exceeds the number of funds in 2021 by $2 billion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) inflow reached $34 billion, while the coin kept testing the target price of $100,000 in the past two weeks. “Bitcoin saw outflows of US$457m, the first significant outflows since early September this year in what we believe is profit taking following bitcoin testing the very psychological level of US$100k,” says CoinShares on the report. Multi-asset crypto and Solana ( SOL ) led the next inflow, which amounted to $441 million and $110 million, respectively. Although both cryptos have seen an outflow this week of $20 million, the month-to-date (MTD) flows have seen different results, with multi-crypto seeing an outflow of $25.3 million. In comparison, Solana records $40 million of inflow. Ripple’s XRP also records massive inflows, with $95 million this week and $141 million year-to-date (YTD). This was because of the hype of the upcoming XRP’s ETF, which was proposed to the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). At the time of writing, XRP’s price also surged to 27.38% in a day of trading.

In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report , CoinShares says that institutional crypto investment products saw a surge in net inflows that brought yearly flows to $37.3 billion last week, a new record. “Digital asset investment products saw inflows totaling US$270m last week, while the flows displayed an unusual dichotomy between assets within the asset class. Since the launch of options on US ETFs, despite their high initial volumes, we have not seen a commensurate rise in ETP volumes at US$22bn last week, compared to US$34bn the week prior. Total inflows this year so far are at a new record of US$37.3bn.” Source: CoinShares The US region led the world with $266 million in inflows, followed by Hong Kong and Germany at $39 million and $12.3 million. “Minor outflows were seen in Switzerland and Canada of US$26m and US$10m respectively.” Following Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) unsuccessful push for the key psychological price level of $100,000 last week, BTC saw outflows of $457 million. Meanwhile, Ethereum ( ETH ) set a new record for yearly inflows. “In stark contrast, Ethereum saw inflows of US$634m, and has experienced a dramatic turnaround in sentiment which has seen year-to-date inflows hit US$2.2bn, finally beating its 2021 inflows record of US$2bn.” XRP products brought in $95 million, possibly due to possibility of an upcoming XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF).

37152596,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656322,1733180452,"Shiba Inu All Set For ‘Bull Show’, Eyes 180% Rally – Analyst","Shiba Inu (SHIB) is stirring up excitement again. The meme-based cryptocurrency has seen bullish momentum lately, grabbing the attention of investors and analysts alike. But is this rally sustainable, and could SHIB really soar to the heights some experts are predicting? Crypto analyst Javon Marks thinks so. He just recently published insights suggesting SHIB may be targeting $0.000081, a massive 179% jump from where it is today. The market has been very unpredictable, but Marks said that this breakout is a sign of strength. Is this enough to keep SHIB in the spotlight? Bullish Signals Shine Bright Recent success by Shiba Inu in closing above important resistance levels has revived expectations for more gains. Technical successes along these lines are suggestive of good buy order accumulation. When SHIB continues on this trend, then reaching the $0.000081 target is not very far-fetched. $SHIB (Shiba Inu), after recently confirming another bull pattern, looks to be further joining the bull show as prices are now showing signs of MAJOR STRENGTH! With holding breakouts implying that $0.000081 target to still be in play, these prices can be subject to another… https://t.co/CKpxZb7CMh pic.twitter.com/lu2QT5FzEg — JAVON MARKS (@JavonTM1) December 1, 2024 At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.00003061, which is an increase of 13% in the last 24 hours. That is no small achievement in a volatile market. According to analysts, for SHIB to keep on moving upward, maintaining support levels will be of prime importance. It is not about breaking resistance; it is also about staying above it. Recent Setbacks And Market Volatility However, not all has been smooth sailing. SHIB saw a slight pullback recently, dropping to $0.000029 after losing 6% in a single day. This decline mirrors a broader market slump, with the total crypto market cap shrinking by 6%. Even against Bitcoin, SHIB stumbled, recording a 4% loss. With these fluctuations, one can see the risks that crypto trading poses. Investors should wait for clear breakout confirmations and keep an eye on broader market trends. Short-term price movements are always misleading, so patience is key. The Road Ahead For Shiba Inu Beyond price movements, there are strategic moves made on the part of Shiba Inu to evolve its ecosystem. Developers are working on advanced integration of blockchain technologies to boost utility. Smarter contract platforms can transition it from a mere meme coin to a valuable tool for decentralized applications (dApps). The whole shift might attract long-term investors to look for more than speculative gain. Meanwhile, as the memecoin’s journey to $0.000081 is ambitious, the short-term to medium-term performance of Shiba Inu is quite robust, showing a 109% increase in the last three months. If the bullish trend is sustained and it takes advantage of the technology involved, even the critics will be surprised.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-loves-russia-solana-memecoin-to-explode-17000-before-exchange-listings-as-shib-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

This decision follows months of recovery efforts that ultimately failed to restore the platform’s viability. DMM Bitcoin to Transfer All Assets to SBI VC Trade According to a report from Nikkei Asia, the exchange also plans to sell all its assets to SBI VC Trade, a trading company owned by the SBI Group. SBI VC Trade confirmed in a December 2 statement that an agreement had been reached to acquire all assets of DMM Bitcoin as part of its liquidation process. The transfer, expected to conclude by the end of Q1 2025, will include customer accounts and assets held by the exchange. Details on the specific transfer methods and dates will be disclosed in future announcements. As part of the transition, the company plans to expand its services by offering 14 crypto spot trading options currently available on DMM Bitcoin’s platform. The two firms will continue discussing the asset and account transfer process. DMM Bitcoin was hacked on May 31, 2024, resulting in the theft of 4,502.9 BTC, worth approximately $305 million at the time. The exchange confirmed the breach , announcing that it had taken steps to prevent further unauthorized withdrawals by suspending all spot purchase transactions. Further, it assured customers it would reimburse lost funds by acquiring an equivalent amount of Bitcoin with backing from its associated companies. To that end, DMM Bitcoin secured a 5 billion yen loan in June and outlined plans to raise an additional 50 billion yen to meet its obligations. Failed Recovery Efforts Despite the recovery efforts, ongoing service restrictions and increased challenges forced the exchange to abandon its plans and ultimately decide to shut down its operations. In July, the attackers, believed to be the infamous Lazarus Group, were tracked laundering more than $35 million in stolen funds through Huione Guarantee, an online marketplace that has reportedly become a hub for illicit activities. PeckShieldAlert also reported that an additional 500 BTC had been transferred across multiple wallets in August. However, all attempts to recover the stolen funds have been unsuccessful. The DMM Bitcoin hack ranks as Japan’s second-largest digital asset breach, following the $534 million Coincheck attack in 2018. Coincheck’s incident was mainly attributed to the exchange’s inadequate security practices. Most of the stolen tokens were stored in a single online hot wallet secured by just one private key rather than in offline cold storage or secure multi-signature wallets, as recommended by their issuer.

While experts believe it will boost privacy-focused projects, many are unsure of its benefits to new cryptos like Lunex and established tokens like UNI and XLM. Regardless of its impact on DeFi, Lunex’s focus on security and enhanced privacy features already account for some of its massive attraction to investors and the explosion in its presale phase. Read more about why Lunex trump's XLM and UNI’s performance. Lunex Network attracts investors with privacy guarantee, sells 2 billion tokens With the rise of DeFi, users face growing security and privacy risks to their funds and data. Lunex Network (LNEX) addresses these challenges by offering innovative solutions, including a non-custodial wallet with access to over 50,000 assets across multiple blockchains. Users retain full control over their private keys, reducing risks of hacks or fund loss. Lunex further employs advanced encryption methods and regular smart contract audits, including by Solidproof, to add further protection layers, safeguard sensitive data, and prevent breaches. Lunex also prioritizes user privacy by minimizing data collection and eliminating reliance on centralized servers, reducing the risk of hacks or leaks. Its no-KYC policy allows users to trade, store, and manage assets anonymously. Making waves in its presale, this new crypto is closing in on 2 billion $LNEX tokens sold and almost $3.7 million in collected funds. It is currently available at an extremely low price of $0.0033, making now an excellent time to acquire LNEX tokens. Stellar (XLM) partners with Blockaid to upgrade security amid hacks Blockaid, a Web3 security platform, has partnered with XLM to enhance the protection of decentralized applications (dApps) by integrating its advanced Onchain Detection and Response (ODR) technology. The integration begins with XLM’s Freighter and Lobstr wallets, which will now benefit from Blockaid’s real-time threat monitoring and swift response capabilities. These security features aim to fortify the Stellar (XLM) blockchain against potential vulnerabilities. Ido Ben Natan, CEO of Blockaid, announced that the company’s latest round of security enhancements is designed to alert users about potentially risky transactions, decentralized applications (dApps), or tokens. Using Blockaid, XLM adds to its most recent security upgrade, which it partnered with Hypernative Labs. This partnership enabled Stellar to integrate advanced security features to prevent phishing attacks, fraud, and market manipulation. These improvements will likely drive greater adoption of the Stellar network, benefiting its native token, XLM. With increasing engagement from users and projects, XLM could see a surge in demand, potentially influencing its market price. Uniswap (UNI) upgrades security with a $15.5 million bounty Uniswap Labs (UNI) has offered $15.5 million to identify vulnerabilities in the core smart contracts of its v4 decentralized exchange (DEX) platform. This initiative bolsters UNI’ssecurity and protects users' funds from potential risks. UNI’s announcement coincided with a significant price surge for its native token. Over the past week, UNI saw a 15% increase, with experts crediting the price rally to renewed optimism in the DeFi, coupled with Uniswap's proactive security measures. Despite UNI’s projection for a 30% increase and XLM’s for a massive surge, Lunex’ssecurity measures and additional features ensure it’s gaining faster. Investors have locked on to the enormous potential of the project, and they’re now positioning themselves to take advantage of the huge gains fast-approaching on the horizon.

Over 1.78 billion tokens have already been sold, raising an impressive $3.7 million. It’s clear that investors are flocking to Lunex for good reasons. First, it’s all about the perks. Lunex offers advanced performance analytics, giving you real-time insights and predictive market tools to stay ahead of the curve.

Shibarium strikes ATH: Shiba Inu's layer-2 increases independent of market upheaval Shibarium, Shiba Inu's layer-2 protocol has reached an interesting benchmark, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) achieving an ATH of $8.57 million. Despite SHIB’s current dip in TVL to $4.58 million, data shows Shiba-related activities dominate with $3.06 million, followed by WoofSwap and ChewySwap contributing $875,270 and $497,016, respectively. Shibarium's wallet activity is also on the rise, nearing 1.9 million addresses. This growth indicates strong engagement, with new wallets likely contributing to staking during the recent SHIB ATH. Even so, the community's unwavering participation continues to underscore Shibarium’s potential for long-term growth and innovation. Pepe’s bull flag signals a breakout on the horizon PEPE is showing exciting potential, with a bull flag pattern forming on its 4-hour chart, a classic signal of a possible breakout. This setup indicates that the meme coin could surpass $0.000025 and potentially reach as high as $0.000041. If this happens, all current holders could return to profitability, highlighting PEPE’s strong recovery prospects. Adding to the optimism is the Global In/Out of Money (GIOM) indicator, which reveals weak resistance at $0.000023 and solid support from PEPE holders. This means PEPE has room to grow, supported by a robust base of committed investors. However, as with any investment, it’s crucial to keep an eye on market conditions and make informed decisions.

37151292,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=621681,1733177430,Moodeng (MOODENG) jumps by 95% after fast Coinbase listing,"Solana meme token Moodeng (MOODENG) nearly doubled its price, rallying close to $0.60. MOODENG expanded following a faster-than-expected listing on Coinbase. Moodeng turned into the new rollover token for the meme space, after going through a vertical rally. The chief reason was the quick listing from Coinbase, soon after adding the token to their roadmap. The listing suggests the meme super cycle is far from over, and the exchange has deemed this token promising enough. Coinbase has bypassed other cult assets like DogWifHat (WIF) and Popcat (POPCAT) in favor of a mass-appeal meme. Assets added to the roadmap today: Moo Deng (MOODENG) https://t.co/rRB9d3hSr2 — Coinbase Assets 🛡️ (@CoinbaseAssets) December 2, 2024 As an immediate effect, MOODENG daily volumes reached an all-time high above $890M. The token was on track to repeat its previous price record above $0.64, with sustainably high activity. Open interest for MOODENG increased above $232M but with a shift toward short positions. In the past day, short positions expanded from 29% to 49%, as the rally is expected to stall after the initial enthusiasm. The Coinbase listing highlights the lack of a Binance spot pair. MOODENG is only listed on the futures market. Spot pairs also mean parts of the MOODENG supply shift to exchanges, with fewer decentralized whale wallets. While previous tokens took a while to be listed, MOODENG went on the fast track. As a result, the token broke out of its stagnation around $0.30, returning to the $0.60 range in a near-vertical rally. MOODENG was one of the few meme tokens in the green in the past 24 hours, as attention shifted to XRP and altcoins. MOODENG rallied from its recent lows up to $0.60. | Source: Coinmarketcap The Coinbase listing of Pepe (PEPE) had a similar effect, granting additional legitimacy to the token. Coinbase has onboarded a small selection of memes, including SHIB and BONK. MOODENG struggles for $1B valuation Despite the expansion, the market cap of MOODENG is still suck under $600M, with no easy path to growing above $1B. The meme token market is going through a series of rollovers into new tokens, as sentiment and exposure shifts. The direction of the meme market is still dependent on dog-themed tokens. MOODENG is seen as potentially becoming a blue-chip meme, after adding Coinbase as its first major exchange. The meme has universal appeal and has been selected as part of meme portfolios. MOODENG is an expansion of the animal meme theme, which has a wider adoption potential, instead of being a cult. The lack of a cult community also means MOODENG may go through boom and drawdown cycles, with no general drive to hold for the long term. Wintermute increased MOODENG supply Wintermute, emerging as a leading market-maker in 2024, increased its MOODENG supply in the past four weeks. MOODENG is now the second-biggest holding for Wintermute, after accumulating more tokens. The market maker started with 552K tokens in October, expanding to a peak of 80M tokens. After some selling, Wintermute is still the third-largest holder of MOODENG, with 61M tokens. The Wintermute accumulation happened ahead of the Coinbase announcements, leading to speculations of upcoming listings. Wintermute’s selection of tokens is seen as an indicator of a potential addition to exchanges. MOODENG already spread to 54,547 holders, with more than 30% of the supply stored on exchanges. This meme token is at the bottom of the list when it comes to decentralization. According to crypto influencer Murad Mahmudov, MOODENG is the least decentralized among top memes. The top 100 addresses hold more than 56% of the MOODENG supply. Despite the mass hype and the popularity of the meme, MOODENG shows some signs of sniping and accumulation in whale wallets. The Ethereum version of MOODENG also shows a prevalence of connected wallets, revealing a controlled supply. The addition of Coinbase may distribute MOODENG to more retail wallets, but may not make a dent in the largest and most influential holdings. The token relies more on centralized markets, with the potential to realize fast profits. The recent listing will further change the MOODENG trading profile, potentially increasing its activity to rival Popcat (POPCAT) or older assets.

37151297,https://thecoinrise.com/romania-taps-blockchain-technology-for-its-electoral-processes/,1733177356,Romania Taps Blockchain Technology for Its Electoral Processes,"Romania has employed blockchain technology in its elections to promote transparency and clarity. The South Eastern European country utilized the technology to monitor the electoral processes, including validating and counting the presidential votes. Romania is the first European country to utilize technology in this way. All transactions can be viewed on the ledger made available online through the official website of the Permanent Electoral Authority in Romania (ROAP). The electoral body developed a dashboard where citizens can track the results live on a public ledger. To maintain voter privacy, the dashboard conceals the name of the candidate for whom the voter voted. ROAP Promotes Electoral Transparency and Accountability With STS The voting system is a collaborative effort of ROAP and the country’s Special Telecommunication Service (STS). According to STS, the system utilizes the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI), with nodes scattered across 27 European countries. In this context, nodes are computers or devices that keep the public records of the transactions in the blockchain. “This modern technological implementation aims to strengthen the resilience of the electoral system in Romania by ensuring traceability and increasing confidence in data integrity,” STS explained. Noteworthy, ROAP’s synergy with STS offers an extra layer of transparency and accountability to the system. How Romania’s Blockchain Voting System Works All data collected at the various polling stations are recorded as a transaction on the blockchain. Each transaction contains public information and a hash of private data. This privacy is maintained from the beginning to the end of the process. With decentralization at the core of many blockchain processes, the network’s nodes are hosted by dozens of national and regional authorities and academic institutions. Apart from ensuring decentralization, this action also alleviates opportunities for any alterations. Other Countries to Follow Suit After Romania The United States recently held its 2024 presidential elections , with a tough battle between the Republican and Democratic parties. Former US president Donald Trump represented the Republicans, while the current Vice president Kamala Harris was for the Democratic party. Of the two, Trump demonstrated a more pro-crypto stance, which eventually helped him secure a seat in the White House. With a more blockchain and crypto-friendly stance, America may consider adopting a similar voting system for its future election.

You might be wondering if Avalanche (AVAX) made the cut, or if other hidden gems are ready to shine. And speaking of innovative projects, there’s one that’s already caught our attention— IntelMarkets . With its dual-chain functionality, combining Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem with Solana’s speed and low fees, it’s shaping up to be a game changer. Let’s dive into the top contenders! Doge Days Ahead: Can Dogecoin Fetch $1 This Altseason? Dogecoin is a strong crypto market challenger, particularly as Altseason approaches. Dogecoin’s trading volumes and price have increased due to retail FOMO. DOGE’s RSI (Relative Strength Index) has bounced from the oversold zone, signalling buying possibilities for a recovery. DOGE regularly recovers from short dips in earlier booms. As the price action continues to gain momentum, the moving averages are suggesting a bullish trend for Dogecoin. These technical indicators indicate that the momentum could carry DOGE past key resistance levels. With its strong community support and increasing retail interest, Dogecoin is positioning itself to dominate this Altseason. Looking ahead, many analysts are predicting that DOGE could break past $1, especially with the ongoing FOMO and heightened trading activity. As retail traders keep fueling its movement, Dogecoin is likely to continue its impressive run throughout December. Avalanche (AVAX) could be the surprise altcoin winner this December The December Altseason is looking good for AVAX, which might lead to big profits. Avalanche (AVAX) reversed its 2022–2023 negative trend by breaking out of a long-term downtrend. With a steady 11.27% advance in the previous week, AVAX may break over the $45 resistance zone and reach its next big objective of $65.

BTCW offers a 0% expense ratio until January 2026. However, IBIT counters with a six-month discounted fee of 0.12%, narrowing the effective savings. I see BTCW’s declining trading volume as a shift toward long-term holding, while IBIT continues to attract active traders and benefits from a virtuous liquidity cycle. Despite BTCW’s temporary fee advantage, IBIT remains the superior ETF due to lower transaction costs, higher liquidity, and additional features like options availability. This is my second article part of the “Bitcoin ETFs Showdown” series I am writing for Seeking Alpha, where I analyze different Bitcoin ETFs, comparing them against the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), the largest and most liquid Bitcoin (BTC-USD) exchange-traded fund on the market. My last article concerned the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), which I see as an overall slightly inferior choice than IBIT. This article focuses on the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund ETF ( BTCW ). Once again, I will compare BTCW against IBIT to determine whether IBIT remains the best choice for investors. This series does not explore whether it’s the optimal time to invest in Bitcoin. I continue to see Bitcoin as a high-risk, asymmetric opportunity based on its potential to evolve into a global reserve asset. Investors unsure about Bitcoin should study its fundamentals and evaluate if it fits their risk tolerance and investment goals. If you are interested in learning more about Bitcoin, you can find my broader investment thesis and thoughts about Bitcoin on my Seeking Alpha profile . BTCW: ETF profile The first thing that I noticed when opening BTWC’s webpage is the relative chaos in terms of documentation for this ETF. WisdomTree released an initial 21 page ETF prospectus , followed by three prospectus supplements of 20+ pages each, the latest of which came in November of this year. Additionally, quarterly 10K reports are also available to download. While very generous in terms of documentation, the webpage of BTCW is surprisingly scarce in terms of information about the fund. There is no clear mention of custodians, nor of what exact Bitcoin index or index proxy the ETF tracks (if any). WisdomTree claims its BTCW fund will track the price of Bitcoin based on an “independently calculated value based on an aggregation of executed trade flow of major bitcoin spot exchanges”. Interestingly in my view, only one of the four available prospectus documents reveals what WisdomTree means with “independently calculated”: The Trust will hold bitcoin and will value its Shares daily based on the value of bitcoin as reflected by the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate – New York Variant (the “Reference Rate”), which is an independently calculated value based on an aggregation of executed trade flow of major bitcoin spot platforms. Which is to say, the BTCW ETF tracks the same index as IBIT and most other Bitcoin ETFs - the ME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate – New York Variant. This is an index that produces a once a day price for Bitcoin aggregating multiple trade data from different cryptocurrency exchanges. IBIT, while tracking the exact same index, makes it clear the fund uses this index from the very beginning in its website and marketing material. Further deep diving into available documentation also reveals how, exactly like IBIT, the BTCW fund uses Coinbase (COIN) as its custodian. I see custodian risk as one of the main elements to keep in mind when investing in Bitcoin via ETFs - something I covered in my very first article about IBIT, explaining the differences and risks between self custody and exposure to BTC via ETFs. While the BTCW ETF is in line with other Bitcoin ETFs for what concerns custodian and index tracking, the issues start when looking at key financial metrics and how they compare with those of IBIT. I will cover these elements in the next sections of this article. Key metrics at a glance The BTCW ETF has the following key metrics at the time of writing: Expense ratio of 0.25%, with the fee completely waived until January 10th, 2026 or until the fund reaches $ 2.5 Billion in Assets Under Management ( AUM ). Asset Under Management of $ 365 Million - which makes it seem likely the expense ratio will remain at 0% until January 2026. Average Bid/Ask Spread of 0.09%. Average Daily Trading Volume of $ 5.51 Million. The main issue of the BTCW ETF in my view is the fact it is a very illiquid fund, compared to major BTC ETFs such as IBIT. The Bid/Ask spread is very high, at 0.09%. The fund often trades at a somewhat significant difference with its Bitcoin holding, as outlined by WisdomTree itself in the chart below. BTCW's premium / discount trading levels, history (BTCW webpage) Except for its effectively 0% expense ratio (which I will cover in more detail in comparison to IBIT in the next section), I see this ETF is not competitive in the context of Bitcoin ETFs. Investors purchasing it are effectively giving up 0.09% of their fund in the form of Bid/Ask spread, with the added risk of purchasing a fund that trades at a discount from its holdings. The relative complexity of its documentation, which in my view signals a weak marketing support from its issuer, also does not help in making BTCW a decent choice for investors. BTCW vs. IBIT IBIT vs. BTCW, key metrics at a glance (Author's elaboration of Seeking Alpha and ETF.com data) The chart above compares key metrics of the BTCW ETF with IBIT, with ""P3M"" reflecting changes between August and November 2024. Similar to my observations about ARKB in my previous article, BTCW experienced a notable decline in Average Daily Trading Volume over the past three months, contributing to its relative illiquidity. I find this data point interesting, as I believe it indicates how BTCW investors are shifting from active trading to long-term holding, while active Bitcoin traders gravitate towards more liquid options like IBIT. This dynamic creates a virtuous cycle for IBIT, which becomes increasingly liquid over time, and a vicious cycle for less liquid funds like BTCW. The only positive element that would make me consider BTCW against IBIT is that - given the fact the fund has less than $ 500 Million in AUM - the expense ratio is likely to be 0% until January 10th, 2026. This could result in meaningful fee savings, potentially offsetting BTCW's illiquidity for investors holding until early 2026 before switching to a more liquid ETF like IBIT. However, a more careful analysis reveals how IBIT is still preferable to BTCW, even when accounting for its 0% effective expense ratio. First, IBIT also offers a discount for first time buyers in the form of a 6 month period where the issuer only charges 0.12% in fees. So the effective “saving” of buying BTCW instead of IBIT in the first year would only be of about 0.13%. Second, BTCW’s higher bid/ask spread of 0.18% outweighs the fee advantage when compared to IBIT's 0.02% spread and 0.13% expense ratio. Ultimately, IBIT’s liquidity and lower transaction costs make it the superior option despite BTCW’s temporary fee waiver. Conclusion: I cannot find a good reason to enter BTCW over IBIT IBIT vs. BTCW, qualitative assessment (Author's work) The above table summarizes the qualitative assessments I made across this article. Due to its illiquidity, I find it difficult to recommend investing in the BTCW ETF. Investors would face up to 0.18% in costs just to enter and exit their positions. Additionally, there’s a risk of the fund becoming even less liquid over time, as suggested by the declining trend in Average Daily Volumes observed in recent months. Even accounting for the fee waiver until January 2026 does not change the picture for BTCW. This is a trend that I have started observing in the world of Bitcoin ETFs: they are all seemingly losing their battle with IBIT, primarily due to the sheer size of the latter fund, which constantly improves its liquidity metrics. I believe many issuers, including WisdomTree, will need to rethink their Bitcoin ETF strategies in the coming years to ensure their products remain relevant in the market. Finally, a note about options: these are available for IBIT since November, while there are currently no options on offer for the BCW ETF. Risks to investing in Bitcoin ETFs and BTCW Investing in Bitcoin remains a highly speculative bet on its potential to mature into a global reserve asset. While I personally find this bet compelling, it represents the primary risk for anyone considering BTCW or any Bitcoin ETF and should be carefully evaluated. Another critical risk for Bitcoin ETFs is custodian reliance. Funds like BTCW depend on custodians such as Coinbase to safeguard their Bitcoin holdings. Any fraudulent activity or security breach by the custodian could lead to significant losses for investors. BTCW's reliance on a single custodian heightens this risk. Lastly, BTCW's potential illiquidity is a concern. If its bid/ask spread rises significantly above the current 0.09%, it could pose another challenge for investors.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4741602-bitcoin-etfs-showdown-btcw-falls-short-against-ibit?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37150657.jpeg

Trading volume grew and grew through the fall. All along, doubts lingered about whether the platform’s trader base would hold steady after the ballots were cast.  On Election Day, the research arm of gaming and VC giant Animoca put out a report with a bold prediction: there's nothing for Polymarket to worry about. The crypto-based prediction market, according to the report, had a significant base of non-election bettors to carry it through.  Naturally, there would be smaller numbers – what can be as captivating as a political face-off involving Donald Trump? – but it'd be a far cry from a ghost town. Three-quarters of Polymarket users, Animoca noted, trade   contracts unrelated to the election.  A month later, that analysis is looking right.  A key data point to track is the open interest on Polymarket. Open interest, which is the total value of active positions in Polymarket’s prediction markets, reflects the platform’s liquidity, user activity, and overall market engagement.  Data from a Dune Analytics dashboard shows that while open interest hit peaked just above $475 million on Election Day – and, predictably, significantly declined in the days after – it has been ticking back up in the last week.  The data shows open interest dropped to a low of $93.91 million on November 12, then slowly climbed to $104 million by November 15 and further to $115.25 million by November 30. These aren't bad numbers  for Polymarket by any means, because this is where open interest was in mid-September, when election fever was in full swing.  Similarly, daily volumes, while down sharply from their $367 million peak the day after the election, have plateaued in the mid- to high eight figure range, which is still higher than they were in September.  The next metric to look at is the number of active wallets on the platform.  In the last week, this metric – which reflects the number of traders active on the platform – has been hovering around the mid-30,000 mark, which isn't substantially lower than the weeklong run-up to election day, when there were an average of 39,100 active wallets at work.  And is Polymarket reliant on a few whales to drive volume? Not really.  Data shows that around 60% of all bets are coming in under $100, and only 5.8% of bets are between $1,000 and $5,000.  Polymarket is here to stay, but dark clouds remain. It needs to work through its legal issues, which may soon be resolved if President-elect Trump installs a crypto-friendly financial regulatory regime.  Influencer Mea Culpa  A social media influencer involved in a Kalshi plot to bash Polymarket and its founder, Shayne Coplan, has apologized for a post in which he called Coplan the ""n-word"" and said he ""look[ed] guilty.""  ""I was doing other business with Kalshi and just tweeted it,"" Antonio Brown wrote on X (formerly Twitter) Saturday. ""I want to say sry to Shayne Coplan.""  Earlier, Clown World, an influencer account that regularly tweets Kalshi-related content, deleted a post calling Coplan and convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried lookalikes.  Kalshi's CEO, Tarek Mansour, has previously declined to comment on the record.  Markets Missed Biden Pardon  Hunter Biden, the wayward son of President Joe Biden, was pardoned Sunday, a move that surprised many – including traders on Polymarket.  The pardon covers all offenses committed in a ten-year period between January 1, 2014, and December 1 of this year, a statement from the White House reads. This covers Hunter's tax and gun charges – in addition to any undetected crimes.  Before the pardon announcement, contracts representing the yes side of the question were trading around 28 to 30 cents, reflecting a 28% to 30% chance a pardon would happen. Now that the White House has confirmed the executive grant of clemency, these contracts shot up to 100%, which means they will pay out 1 USDC, each worth $1, per share.  The market was skeptical a pardon would happen, given multiple pledges by the President that it would not.  In June, the elder Biden promised to respect a jury decision regarding a gun charge and not pardon his son. At the time, the market was giving a 12% chance of a pardon.  Data aggregator Polymarket Analytics shows that the top holder of the yes side, a user who goes by ""PollsR4Dummies"" took home $223,472 on his bet of $87,740.  The polling skeptic is also holding two long-shot yes positions, betting that Fox News personality Pete Hegseth will be confirmed as Secretary of Defense, currently at 32% given recent sexual assault allegations, and that the Fed will cut interest rates three times in 2024 (the market gives this a 29% chance).",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/02/polymarket-retains-loyal-user-base-a-month-after-election-data-shows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9e9573769a9a020fa289fea235667765d2a3aa87-1920x1349.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The latest development addresses the common pain points that users usually experience when onboarding crypto such as the time-consuming exercise going through KYC, which can be lengthy as well as the use of multiple apps, which eventually force users to “abandon ship.” Coinbase addresses challenges users previously encountered to transact With Onramp, developers can embed tools for buying cryptos into third-party applications, for instance, self-custody wallets or decentralized finance platforms. According to Coinbase’s blog post , with Apple Pay supported, users can purchase crypto using the popular payment method already familiar to millions of iPhone owners. This therefore limits the challenges users previously experienced when converting their fiat currencies to digital assets. With Apple Pay on Onramp, Coinbase can now offer a streamlined process with users able to complete transactions in a matter of seconds as they benefit from Apple Pay’s inbuilt security features. It said the aim is to reduce the challenges users experience entering the crypto markets such as connecting bank accounts and KYC verifications. “The process has a lot of friction, and as a result, users abandon ship. But not with Coinbase Onramp.” Coinbase. “Coinbase Onramp takes the hassle out of fiat-to-crypto conversions with lightweight KYC for eligible purchases, free USDC on and offramping, and access to the most popular payment methods,” added Coinbase. Accessing the Coinbase Onramp Formerly known as Coinbase Pay, Onramp is a suite of developer tools that supports fiat-to-crypto payments across apps and wallets. According to Coinbase, already existing customers using Coinbase Onramp do not need to do anything as they will automatically see Apple Pay appear as an option when making an eligible purchase. Onramp is usually used in wallets such as MetaMask, Rainbow, Phantom, and Coinbase wallets. While this latest development takes away the rigorous KYC process that can discourage users, eligible transactions on Onramp are subjected to lightweight KYC checks to meet regulatory requirements, but without unnecessary delays. Coinbase added that users buying the USDC stablecoin with Apple Pay on Onramp will be exempted from transaction fees, as a form of incentive. Apple Pay was introduced in 2014 and now has over 500 million active users worldwide. Responding to the news of this collaboration, some users expressed optimism that this development would “speed up the growth of the crypto industry.” Others described it as the “digital marriage of the century.” Another user identified as EveryBiz said this would also be a game changer. “Big news for $COIN! Integrating Apple Pay makes fiat-to-crypto purchases even more seamless.” User Could this be a game-changer for onboarding new users into the crypto space?” EveryBiz. The collaboration also becomes a significant move towards bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology at a time when the market wants easier access to digital assets.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports.

This remarkable rally was initially propelled by speculative bets on Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, colloquially referred to as the “ Trump trade .” Following Trump’s electoral success, the momentum was sustained by the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), spearheaded by Elon Musk, a prominent advocate within the Dogecoin community. December 5 Could Be A Major Catalyst For Dogecoin The crypto market is now anticipating a pivotal week for Dogecoin, centered around a significant event scheduled for December 5th in Washington, DC. On this date, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are set to address members of Congress, presenting key proposals under the auspices of the Department of Government Efficiency. This development could have a substantial impact on the Dogecoin price. The Department of Government Efficiency , abbreviated as DOGE, has been instrumental in shaping Dogecoin’s recent price movements. Under Musk’s leadership and with support from Donald Trump, DOGE aims to streamline government expenditures and enhance operational efficiency within federal agencies. The mere announcement of this department, coupled with its association with influential figures like Musk and Trump, has ignited significant speculative activity around Dogecoin, leading to pronounced price fluctuations. Historical data underscores the department’s influence on Dogecoin’s valuation. The announcement of Musk’s appointment to lead DOGE resulted in a 15% increase in DOGE’s price. This surge was further amplified by an additional 120% rise within a week, following endorsements and activities related to the initiative. Moreover, Dogecoin experienced a further 10% uptick as DOGE gained traction through extensive discussions on social media and Musk’s financial contributions to related political actions. These price movements are a direct reflection of the heightened trader speculation and public interest driven by media coverage and Musk’s active promotion of the Department of Government Efficiency. The upcoming December 5th event marks a critical juncture for Dogecoin. According to a CNBC report , House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana announced that Musk and Ramaswamy will meet with Republican congressional leaders to discuss major reform ideas aimed at achieving regulatory rescissions, administrative reductions, and cost savings. Johnson stated, “The entrepreneurs will discuss major reform ideas to achieve regulatory rescissions, administrative reductions, and cost savings with GOP lawmakers.” Musk and Ramaswamy have articulated an ambitious agenda for DOGE, including significant reductions to the federal workforce and the closure of numerous federal agencies and regulators. In a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, they articulated their intent to “eliminate expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress,” and to curtail federal funding for entities such as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, several international organizations, and Planned Parenthood. Furthermore, Musk proposed that the White House should “delete” the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent agency tasked with overseeing financial institutions. However, the implementation of these proposals is contingent upon congressional approval, given that the House holds authority over the appropriation of federal funds to agencies. The forthcoming meeting on December 5th signifies the Republican leadership’s serious consideration of Musk and Ramaswamy’s initiatives. The implications for the Dogecoin price are multifaceted. The convergence of governmental initiatives and high-profile endorsements by Musk has heightened DOGE’s visibility within the broader public sphere. Increased trading volumes and speculative trading activity are to be expected as investors closely monitor the outcome of the December 5th meeting. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.41.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-alert-why-december-5-game-changing-date/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png
37150295,https://thecoinrise.com/btfd-surges-past-500k-npcs-hits-24m-and-popcat-goes-viral/,1733175014,"BTFD Surges Past $500K, NPCS Hits $24M, and Popcat Goes Viral","December 2024 has already become a defining moment for the crypto world, with several standout projects dominating the scene. BTFD Coin continues its presale frenzy, raising over $500,000 in just one week. Meanwhile, Non-Playable Coin Solana (NPCS) has seen its market cap explode to $24 million, solidifying its position as a rising star. Adding to the mix, Popcat is stealing the spotlight with its viral appeal, bringing humour and potential utility to the crypto space. Over the years, meme coins have proven they’re more than just internet laughs. From Dogecoin to Shiba Inu, they’ve shown how timing and community can outshine even the most sophisticated tech. BTFD Coin, NPCS, and Popcat are the latest projects poised to redefine the meme coin narrative in 2024. From Dogecoin’s early hype to Shiba Inu’s explosive success, these tokens prove community and timing can outshine tech. Now, BTFD Coin, Gigachad, and Brett are poised to reshape the market in 2024. BTFD Coin: Flipping Market Lows into Big Wins BTFD Coin has wasted no time grabbing the spotlight. With a presale price starting at $0.000004, it’s now in its sixth stage at $0.000058. Over 10 billion coins have been sold, raising more than $500,000 in just days. That’s a staggering pace for a newcomer, but it’s not just the numbers that have people talking. The presale’s momentum has been nothing short of electric. Within 24 hours, BTFD blitzed through 25% of its 16-stage presale journey, raising $150,000 in that first-day frenzy. Early adopters are already seeing the potential for huge returns, especially with the price set to hit $0.0006 once it’s listed. That’s a 10x gain for those who got in at the ground floor. Take this example: Imagine you dropped $4,000 in Stage 5 when the price was $0.00005. That would’ve scored you 80 million BTFD Coins. By the end of the presale, at $0.0006 per coin, your $4,000 investment balloons to $48,000. Let that sink in. What really sets BTFD apart is its ecosystem. A P2E game is in the works, designed to keep the community engaged and earning. There’s also a staking rewards system offering a sweet 90% APY. And with the “Bulls Squad” pushing its ethos of turning market downturns into golden opportunities, BTFD isn’t just a coin; it’s a movement. If you’re looking for the best crypto coin to buy this December, it’s hard to argue against the numbers and the vibe. Gigachad: Meme Culture Meets Crypto Power Gigachad isn’t just a coin; it’s a movement. Inspired by the meme culture surrounding the “Chad” phenomenon, this token has carved a niche for itself by appealing to a community that values humour and confidence. It’s a lighter, fun-driven investment for those who want to mix profit potential with a dose of entertainment. What’s fascinating about Gigachad is its ability to rally a community around its unique branding. Meme contests, hilarious promotions, and an engaged online presence have made it a standout in the crowded crypto market. While it may lack the technical depth of BTFD or the market positioning of Brett, its charm is hard to ignore. If the team behind Gigachad continues to innovate and engage its audience, this coin could ride the wave of meme culture straight into 2024’s crypto spotlight. Brett: A Rising Star in the Meme Coin Universe Brett has been on a tear, recently hitting an all-time high of $0.22 and cementing its place as one of the top-performing meme coins of 2024. With a market cap of $2.21 billion, it now holds the 60th position on CoinMarketCap. This remarkable feat has been driven by strong liquidity inflows and a bullish flag breakout, setting the stage for a December rally. What makes Brett even more intriguing is its potential for listings on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Such developments could inject fresh liquidity and push Brett into the top 50 cryptos by market cap. However, the token’s recent overbought status could lead to short-term pullbacks, making it a more volatile choice for traders. For those who thrive on market swings, Brett might just be the best crypto to buy as it continues to ride its momentum into 2024. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, 2024 is shaping up to be an exciting year for crypto investors. BTFD Coin’s explosive presale performance has set it apart as a powerhouse with unparalleled growth potential. Gigachad’s vibrant community and clever branding bring a fresh twist to the meme coin market, while Brett’s record-breaking rally and top 60 market cap status position it as a strong contender for further success. If you’re ready to dive into the world of high-potential cryptos, now is the time to act. Join the BTFD Coin presale today to secure your stake in this groundbreaking project.

37149929,https://blockworks.co/news/competitors-react-to-jupiter-founder-post,1733175000,Competitors circle after Jupiter founder posts slur,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Over the weekend, the anonymous founder of Jupiter used a racial slur multiple times in an X post — and the Solana DeFi giant’s competitors perceived an opportunity. The post came in response to another anonymous account asking whether a memecoin containing the slur could be verified on Jupiter. Meow, Jupiter’s founder, left the post up for roughly a day, arguing that he didn’t have malicious intent when making the post. He also reposted an “n-word pass” and wrote that he “didn’t know that there is such a big difference between r & a” in reference to the slur. Some pointed out that meow is not American and “sees everyone using” the term online, so he may not have grasped the word’s potential hurtfulness. Still, the crypto community’s response was swift and mostly negative, with Solana ecosystem leaders calling out the behavior and multiple posters pledging to sell Jupiter’s native token. Meow eventually issued an apology for the post, saying, “Racism is obviously completely unacceptable and I love you all.” The market didn’t seem to care much about the incident, however: JUP slid 7.7% over the past 24 hours, but multiple major Solana DeFi tokens drew back 5-10% over that time frame, and JUP’s fall occurred several hours after meow’s racist remark. JUP traded relatively flat on Saturday, and seemingly even saw its price increase relative to other Solana DeFi tokens immediately after the post. Jupiter’s killer feature is a so-called aggregator that automatically routes user swaps across multiple venues to achieve the best possible price for users. In short, you get more value per dollar when swapping on Jupiter than on Phantom or Coinbase, for instance. Jupiter has a pretty big moat with this feature, as we’ve written before , but would-be competitors spied an opportunity after meow’s snafu. Solana-compatible swap app DFlow essentially came out of stealth after the faux pas, posting instructions for how developers could switch their APIs away from Jupiter. DFlow’s founder wrote “crypto needs a massive change culturally,” citing meow’s post as evidence. “After the Meow posts on the weekend, I think [it’s] becoming clear to everyone that a reasonable competitor for their swap product has to come in,” Chris Chung, CEO of the Solana-based aggregator Titan, told me in a text. However, Chung added that “value is everything,” and any Jupiter competitors would have to significantly outperform Jupiter to convince users to switch. I think another part of this story, if it winds up being much of a story at all, could be the institutional side of things. Risk-averse institutions moving into crypto will likely look to do business with professional-seeming founders, and posting racial slurs on social media probably won’t fit the bill.

On December 3, 2024, the sentiment across the cryptocurrency landscape appears bearish, with assets struggling to gain momentum. Solana (SOL) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels Amid the price correction phase, Solana (SOL) has failed to hold its crucial support level and has fallen below the $227 mark. According to expert technical analysis, after hitting its all-time high, SOL entered a consolidation phase, forming a bearish head-and-shoulders price action pattern. Source: Trading View In today’s bearish, or rather price-corrective, stance, SOL breached the neckline of the bearish pattern and attempted to close a daily candle below it. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if SOL closes a daily candle below the $226 level, there is a strong possibility it could decline by 10% to reach the $200 mark in the coming days. On the positive side, SOL is trading above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating an uptrend. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests a potential upside rally in the coming days, as its value is near the oversold zone. The outflow of $159M SOL Despite the bearish outlook, whales and institutions have shown strong confidence and interest in the altcoin, according to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. SOL’s spot inflow/outflow data reveals that over the past four days, exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $159 million worth of SOL. Source: Coinglass In the cryptocurrency context, outflow refers to whales withdrawing tokens from exchanges to their wallets, which is considered a bullish sign and suggests a potential upside rally in the coming days. Considering the outflow, it seems that SOL investors may be capitalizing on the current market sentiment and price decline by acquiring more assets. Current Price Momentum At press time, SOL is trading near $222, having experienced a 6.55% price decline in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume surged by 101%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day.",NEGATIVE,SOL,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/solana-sol-crash-warning-as-support-collapses-eyes-on-200/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37150531,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51215,1733174799,VeChain (VET) Gains Traction with VeBetterDAO Launch,"VeChain (VET) , a blockchain platform specializing in supply chain management and real-world asset integration, demonstrates strong bullish momentum as its ecosystem evolves. The token’s performance reflects its expanding relevance and adoption, supported by significant developments in technology and governance. Current Price and Performance Overview As of report time, VET is trading at $0.05 recording a remarkable 8.51% surge over the past week. This growth aligns with broader market recovery trends and is also driven by VeChain-specific innovations, particularly the launch of VeBetterDAO. The upward trend in VET’s price showcases renewed investor confidence, as the platform positions itself as a leader in integrating sustainability and decentralized technologies. VeBetterDAO: A Game-Changer for Sustainability and Governance A significant contributor to VeChain’s recent success is VeBetterDAO, a groundbreaking initiative combining sustainability, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and real-world assets (RWAs). By incentivizing sustainable behaviors and connecting decentralized governance with tangible assets, VeBetterDAO has captured widespread attention. VeBetterDAO’s sustainability incentives characteristically encourage eco-friendly practices by rewarding participants, making sustainability practical and financially beneficial. Also, its decentralized governance empowers users to have a direct say in ecosystem decisions, fostering transparency and trust. VeBetterDAO links blockchain-based solutions with physical assets, showcasing real-world asset Integration and expanding practical applications. VeBetterDAO’s open participation model has widened its appeal, drawing in a diverse range of stakeholders. This model is expected to strengthen VeChain’s position in the blockchain space, especially as industries increasingly focus on sustainability. Broader Trends in Blockchain Adoption VeChain’s initiatives align with emerging trends in the blockchain sector, including “earn” mechanisms that reward user engagement and sustainability-focused projects. These trends reflect a growing preference for platforms that combine financial incentives with real-world impact. As blockchain adoption expands, VeChain’s focus on community-driven models and real-world applications places it at the forefront of innovation, making it an attractive option for investors and enterprises. VeChain Price Analysis: Support and Resistance Levels for VET The founder of MN Consultancy, Michaël van de Poppe, highlighted VeChain’s price movements. According to his analysis, key levels include $0.02048, which has historically provided a solid foundation for price stability, and a $0.05 resistance Level, a zone where selling pressure tends to emerge. These levels provide crucial insights for traders, suggesting that a sustained break above $0.05 could trigger further bullish activity. TradingView data shows VeChain’s RSI at 68.44, which points to strong bullish momentum without venturing into overbought territory. This indicates the potential for continued upward movement before significant corrections occur. Older coins are actually growing. $VET is one of them. They recently announced VeBetterDAO, $B3TR, an ecosystem in which you earn tokens for taking sustainable actions.

A brief pullback was observed, but it acted as a trendline retest, consolidating the token’s upward trajectory. Using Fibonacci projections, analysts have identified potential targets for VET with $0.087 and $0.15 in view. $0.087 would represent a significant milestone for the token, reflecting nearly double its current value, while $0.15 would equate to a 227.5% increase from current prices, showcasing the platform’s immense growth potential.

Decentralized Technology Mentioned By Enron Corporation Stunt According to a December 2 press release , the parody claims that the once-bankrupt organization will begin a “new chapter” as 2024 comes to an end—one that supposedly includes decentralized technology . We're back. Can we talk? pic.twitter.com/9kt4g0Q84Z — Enron (@Enron) December 2, 2024 “We are dedicated to solving the global energy crisis,” Enron said in a statement.“With a bold new vision, Enron will leverage cutting-edge technology, human ingenuity, and the spirit of adaptation to address the critical challenges of energy sustainability, accessibility, and affordability.” In a video shared to X by Enron, the company said it was ready to “lead by example,” while a countdown on its website claims that it has “something very special to introduce” in seven days. The Houston-based company also announced five “key pillars” to guide business operations, including adaptation as strength, forgiveness and progress, leadership by example, solving the energy crisis, and a nod to cryptocurrencies with the incorporation of permissionless innovation. “Decentralized technology is advancing, and we will of course have a role to play in its future,” Enron stated. Kenneth Lay-founded Company’s Questionable Comeback However, not all were convinced of its official relaunch, with Intelligencer’s Matt Stieb uncovering that the company’s logo is owned by one of the performance artists behind Birds Aren’t Real, a stunt satirizing the ludicrousness of governmental conspiracy theories. For instance, the website itself features highly overpriced merchandise with vague statements, suggesting it could be a method for capitalizing on the logo itself. Similarly, frequent typos and mindless jargon frequent the website, with two of its company values simply labeled as “nice” and “repentant.” However comedic, the second iteration of Enron is sure to be marred with controversy, as the company name is effectively synonymous with financial woe following its 2001 bankruptcy that rocked the nation. Current FTX CEO John Jay Ray III notably led Enron from the ashes during its lengthy bankruptcy process, calling the FTX collapse worse than the energy giant’s. “Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,” Ray wrote in a 2022 court filing . “From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated, and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented.” The post Parody Of Enron Relaunch Makes Waves On Social Media appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/enron-announces-relaunch-hints-at-decentralization/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37151188.jpeg

The rally came after MicroStrategy announced it had acquired nearly $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, adding to its already substantial holdings. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView highlighted the sharp increase in BTC price, a response that deviated from its usual muted reactions to similar news. MicroStrategy’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Dec. 2, later confirmed by CEO Michael Saylor, detailed the week-long acquisition up to Dec. 1. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, commented on the scale of MicroStrategy’s investment. “$MSTR spent $13.5B on 149,900 BTC, with holdings up $21.5B in 30 days,” he noted on X. “Bitcoin market can’t absorb tens of billions short-term without driving prices up, making returns nearly inevitable. If BTC breaks $100K, the gains could grow even more as it enters price discovery.” Trading firm QCP Capital also weighed in, mentioning an upcoming vote by Microsoft shareholders on Dec. 10 regarding adding Bitcoin to the tech giant’s balance sheet. “Could this be the catalyst BTC needs to break 100k before year end?” the firm speculated. QCP added that major Microsoft shareholders, such as Vanguard, BlackRock, and Fidelity, already have crypto exposure through investments in MicroStrategy, Coinbase, and similar firms. If the proposal passes, it could further bolster Bitcoin and related investments. At the time of writing, Bitcoin hovered around $96,000, after briefly testing support below $95,000. Despite some volatility, sentiment among traders remained bullish, with $100,000 as the primary target. “Nice corrective upwards consolidation here resetting RSI & other indicators,” trader Roman noted on X. “We’re also seeing bullish divergences form while building volatility for higher.

37149605,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98248,1733174450,Here’s Why Onchain Analysts Are Projecting An Ultra Bullish Bitcoin Breakout In Two Months,"Bitcoin price has shown signs of a larger breakout in the coming months due to positive market indicators. According to market analyst Crypto Dan , a golden cross has formed on the asset’s Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). This points to high points in a bull market with holders anticipating price peaks. Last month, Bitcoin tapped multiple all-time highs, rallying as high as $99K before the price correction. A golden cross signal indicates another upward swing, although short-term sideways trading has been seen in recent days. Charts mark a golden cross when the 50-day simple moving average crosses the 200-day point, showing bullish levels. This is shown in several assets like XRP and Bitcoin amid the market swing. Meanwhile, SOPR shows that Bitcoin’s profit levels moved within a certain period. Moved BTC is often attributed to sales, which makes it a key metric for analysts. When assets are in the green zone, it points to a wider BTC whale inflow. A Repeat of Progressive Price Action The golden cross of a SOPR occurs twice within a bullish window. The first in this cycle was recorded in January 2023, following institutional entrants into the market after turmoil in the previous year. Crypto prices slumped in 2022 following the collapse of Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin and FTX, wiping billions off the market. The price of BTC increased systemically, trading above $45k following ETF optimism . Approval of these products spiked the price to new levels. Notably, after a golden cross, crypto assets hit new momentum within two months, forming a new target among Bitcoin bulls. “ As the market moves towards the later stages of the cycle, the magnitude of the rise tends to be larger, and the periods of decline/adjustment are shorter. If a steep rise occurs as implied by this indicator within the end of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025, it can be expected that new inflows and additional funds will enter the market, bringing it to its peak,” Dan added. Slow Trading Affects BTC Price Coming off the weekend, Bitcoin recorded outflows alongside the wider market. BTC trades at $95,523, down 1.87% today as bulls attempt to recover losses. Longer-term numbers still stand in the green zone for the asset, but whales signal slow movements above the $90k zone with sights above the $100K. Altcoins have moved similarly except for XRP , which trades above 36%. Meanwhile, Solana and BNB posted 5.16% and 2.77% losses in the last 24 hours.",POSITIVE,BTC | XRP,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/heres-why-onchain-analysts-are-projecting-an-ultra-bullish-bitcoin-breakout-in-two-months/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

37149320,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98246,1733173784,"XRP to $20 Price is Inevitable, Asserts Pundit Amid Surprising Market Setup","XRP, now the 3rd largest cryptocurrency by market valuation, traded in rocket mode for most of Monday following a strong recovery on Sunday. This came after a dip earlier in the week when the price briefly fell to around $1.30, as investors took profits from the recent rally. Despite these short-term fluctuations, XRP has demonstrated impressive resilience, surging more than 275% over the past month and solidifying its position as one of the leading cryptocurrencies. As a result, analysts are growing increasingly bullish on the asset’s long-term outlook. In a tweet, analyst Armando Pantoja expressed his optimism, stating, “$XRP to $2 isn’t even a question. $8-20 is inevitable,” and pointing to several factors driving his bullish sentiment. First, Pantoja pointed to bullish chart patterns indicating a long-term upward trend, sharing an XRP chart highlighting the recent breakout from a seven-year consolidation pennant, with price returning to retest a critical support-resistance level. He also emphasized the notable whale activity, with these investors steadily accumulating XRP at current price levels. According to data from Santiment, over the past weekend alone, these major investors purchased more than 50 million XRP tokens, positioning themselves strategically ahead of what many expect could be a major price surge. The pundit also mentioned favorable technical indicators, such as the MACD cooling off and the RSI reaching a neutral level, suggesting a potential breakout. “ FOMO incoming, sentiment flipping,” he added, suggesting that a surge in retail interest is likely to drive the price higher. Pantoja’s bullish outlook echoes the sentiments of Bitcoin maximalist MMCrypto, who, despite previously dismissing XRP , now acknowledges its potential for a significant price rally. In a recent tweet to his 1.5 million followers, MMCrypto noted , “If you zoom out 4 years for $XRP,” signaling his expectation that the token could surpass $4 in the coming weeks after its breakout from the long-standing pennant pattern. Beyond technical analysis, XRP’s price had long been constrained by the protracted SEC lawsuit. However, a recent landmark court ruling in Ripple’s favor, declaring XRP is not a security, has removed a significant regulatory obstacle, opening doors for broader adoption. Notably, other recent crypto-related legal victories, such as this week’s ruling in favor of Tornado Cash against regulators attempting to classify its activities as illegal. Investors interpret this decision as a clear message that regulators like the SEC lack the authority to enforce rules in areas where Congress has not enacted specific legislation. This precedent could influence future rulings in cases like XRP’s, potentially leading to more favorable outcomes for Ripple and its investors. Adding to this bullish sentiment is the potential for XRP ETF approvals, with recent filings from notable issuers such as WisdomTree , Bitwise, Canary Capital, and 21Shares. The introduction of an XRP ETF would significantly enhance the asset’s credibility among institutional investors, potentially driving substantial capital inflows and accelerating its growth trajectory. XRP traded at $2.7 at press time, reflecting a 25.12% gain over the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/xrp-to-20-price-is-inevitable-asserts-pundit-amid-surprising-market-setup/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

The asset provider has recently launched a platform catering directly to retail investors. This marks the first time the firm, founded in 2013, offers its comprehensive services, which include regulated digital asset trading, staking, lending, wallet management, and self-storage custody, to a global audience of individual investors. BitGo’s Retail Platform Built on A Legacy of Trust and Security BitGo’s reputation in crypto is built on years of providing robust security solutions for large-scale institutional clients. The firm has been entrusted with safeguarding billions of dollars in crypto assets. It has served as a custodian for major players’ client repayments, including Ark Invest, 21Shares, Valkyrie , and the now-defunct Mt. Gox exchange. It is also the custodian for the largest Ethereum-based Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) asset. For years, BitGo’s institutional clients have benefited from its secure custody, seamless trading services, and advanced settlement solutions. For the first time, BitGo has made these services available to the retail market, promising the same high-level security and transparency for individual investors. This decision aligns with a broader trend in the crypto industry. Infrastructure providers increasingly recognize the rising demand from retail investors for institutional-grade services. BitGo’s Retail Platform to Bridge Retail and Institutional Services BitGo’s CEO, Mike Belshe, emphasized the importance of security and trust in the launch of the new platform. To incentivize early adoption, U.S. users can register for the chance to win a full Bitcoin, a move designed to attract a large number of participants to the platform. This move concerns more than just opening up new revenue streams for BitGo. He stated that it also bridges the gap between retail and institutional services. With concerns over crypto platform security, BitGo’s trusted reputation gives it an edge in attracting users seeking reliability. BitGo’s $100M Funding Boost Powers Retail Launch and WBTC Strategy The launch of the retail platform comes on the heels of BitGo’s $100 million Series C funding round in 2023. This valued the company at $1.75 billion. This funding is expected to help drive the growth of the new retail platform, making it a formidable player in the space. However, BitGo’s strategic shifts extend beyond just its new retail offerings. The company has also gained attention for its role in wrapping Bitcoin (WBTC) governance . WBTC is a popular tokenized version of Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain. In August, BitGo announced plans to become a minority owner in a joint venture with Hong Kong-based BiT Global to manage WBTC custody. BiT Global is a trust company linked to Tron founder Justin Sun.

On Monday, the business intelligence firm and “Bitcoin development company” announced that it had purchased even more Bitcoin for approximately $1.5 billion. Microstrategy Acquires Additional 15,400 BTC According to an 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, MicroStrategy purchased 15,400 additional Bitcoin for a total of $1.5 billion at an average price of $95,976 per Bitcoin between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1. https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1863569873713955156 While that’s smaller than the company’s most recent BTC buys and a drop in the ocean compared to its overall stockpile, it does push the size of the company’s holdings to a new record peak. As of Nov. 2, MicroStrategy holds 402,100 Bitcoin, or $39 billion worth at the current price of the asset. The company’s overall average purchase price is $58,263. The 402,100 tokens represent over 1.9% of the 21 million BTC that can ever be created, with roughly 19.7 million Bitcoin of the total 21 million supply currently circulating. The latest acquisition follows the sale of a further 3.7 million MicroStrategy shares under the firm’s existing at-the-market program. According to the disclosure, the company still has $11.3 billion worth of shares remaining available for sale as part of its planned $21 billion equity offering and $21 billion of fixed-income securities, seeking a total of a whopping $42 billion capital raise over the next three years for further Bitcoin acquisition. MicroStrategy’s Monday announcement marked the fourth consecutive week of major BTC purchases in a row, following Nov. 25th’s record-shattering 55,500 BTC purchase for a whopping $5.4 billion at an average price of $97,862 per coin and the previous week’s $4.6 billion BTC buy . MicroStrategy founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor is one of the most vocal Bitcoin evangelists in the finance world.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Ripple CTO David Schwartz accuses the government of pressuring banks to cancel unfavored individuals and businesses with no evidence that they committed crimes. According to Schwartz, this type of “indirect regulation” is unconstitutional as it ignores due process and the First Amendment. Schwartz refers to the trend as “Orwellian nonsense” and calls for an end to it in its entirety. “Our government has become addicted to indirect regulation precisely because of these evils. It is cheaper and easier to pressure someone else to punish me than to charge me with a crime and give me due process. But the government ought not to punish people without giving them due process. It is easier to pressure banks to cut off disfavored businesses than to make that business illegal. But if the government wants to stop some commercial activity, it should go through the proper lawmaking process, with full political accountability, to prohibit it, not use backdoor secret pressure to drive it underground. END ALL INDIRECT REGULATION.” Last week, Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong said that Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler wanted to destroy the crypto industry and possibly broke the law in their crusade against digital assets. “Warren and Gensler tried to unlawfully kill our entire industry, and it was a major factor in the Democrats losing the election. The Democratic party should realize Warren is a liability and further distance themselves if they want to have any hope of rebuilding.” Armstrong made the statement amid swirling rumors that the US government cut off 30 tech and crypto founders from banking services.

To read full editions, subscribe . The transatlantic trade-dependent Euro Area is prepping for Donald Trump’s second term and the return of higher tariffs . US tariffs may lower Euro Area GDP by 0.4%, the Institute of International Finance (IIF) estimated in a Monday note . With many European countries yet to fully recover from the pandemic and increased competition from China , renewed tariffs could lead to a “substantial economic hit,” the report adds. Among the countries most likely to be impacted are Germany, France and Italy. Machinery and industrial goods exports from Italy and Germany are expected to be hit especially hard by new policies. Germany, the US’s largest exporter, also heads into its second straight year of zero growth. France could see exports of goods in the aerospace and luxury industries decline by as much as 4% over Trump’s next term, according to the IIF. But, as a new tariff scenario chart from Bloomberg Economics points out, Trump’s statements, which often shake global currencies, come much faster than the tariff policies themselves. Those could take weeks if not months, depending on how liberally Trump plans to take advantage of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Aside from timing, there’s also likely to be a discrepancy between Trump’s threats and what actually happens (during his first term, Trump walked back his initial proposed tariff on Mexico after the country agreed to increase border patrol). We’ll be watching as policies unfold, and as the next administration continues to tease its plans (I’d keep an eye on Truth Social).

And today, it reached a price not seen in nearly seven years, subsequently making a historic comeback as the third-largest crypto by market cap. XRP’s rally has caught the attention of the cryptoverse, with Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal publicly admitting that he was wrong about XRP — a coin he had previously slammed for being a laggard. “You Were Right, I Was Wrong” Ripple’s XRP fell out of the top 3 elite crypto club in December 2020 as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued the San Fransisco-based fintech firm for allegedly raising $1.3 billion in an unregistered securities offering. With Ripple claiming several legal wins this year and the SEC’s case nearing resolution in the near future as the agency’s chair Gary Gensler prepares to step down in January, XRP has surged meteorically in recent weeks, outperforming other crypto majors. After lagging behind Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), Tether’s USDT, Solana (SOL), BNB, and Circle’s USDC for years, XRP has finally reclaimed its spot as the third most valuable crypto in the market. On Dec. 2, the price of XRP jumped to a recent high of $2.79, according to data tracked by CoinGecko . The last time the Ripple-promoted token was trading above $2.7 was in early 2018, just after setting its all-time high peak of $3.40. That was roughly seven years ago. XRP has jumped by approximately 96% over the last week, pushing its 30-day gain to 443%. Amid this upsurge, well-known industry pundit Raoul Pal took to X (aka Twitter) to address XRP fans, referring to them as “XRP Jedi Warriors.” Pal admitted being wrong, while XRP investors were right about the crypto’s bullish price action. “You were right, I was wrong. Well done! Dinosaurs still roam the earth.” Raoul Pal Praises XRP Community’s Resilience The Real Vision CEO also revealed that he still owns some XRP from the “delisting times” the coin suffered after the SEC lodged its lawsuit against Ripple. He further commended XRP holders for their unwavering conviction in the asset despite the regulatory cloud that hung over it for four years. According to him, XRP investors have “walked through hell to get here.” Notably, Pal had urged investors to ditch XRP in September, dubbing it “old.” He claimed investors would miss out on the bull market by holding XRP. The token was changing hands at 50 cents at the time, indicating lackluster growth and ranking among the worst-performing crypto majors. Pal went as far as to suggest that XRP investors were doing themselves a disservice by being in a “cult.” However, XRP has proven Pal wrong, skyrocketing amid expectations of a crypto-friendly Trump administration and the significant progress on Ripple’s dollar-pegged, overcollateralized RLUSD stablecoin .",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/raoul-pal-admits-he-was-wrong-and-xrp-army-was-right-as-ripples-xrp-hits-seven-year-high/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Intraday volume also increased significantly, rising from around $2.18 million to over $60 million. This explosion put XYO on top of the leading gainers in the market on the day, with the price jump over the past month reaching 278%. XYO offers a decentralized physical infrastructure network with key features including consumer software, developer tools, and digital assets.

In October, the XYO team announced that the project had bridged the native token to Solana. This meant native availability on Solana as well as Ethereum, with trading support on decentralized exchanges Raydium and Jupiter. Bridging has allowed for decentralized applications that integrate XYO on the Solana network to tap into SOL’s low transaction fees. XYO reached an all-time high of $0.08203 in November 2021.

In total, Jump has made 10 $SLAP purchases totaling approximately $489,690 and no sales. The first buys were on November 23, two days after the token was listed. The large purchases made earlier today (52 and 49.92 ETH) indicate that Jump is building up a substantial position, so these are not ‘pump and dump’ flash-in-the-pan trades. Jump Trading’s average entry price is $0.0038. Is a Tier 1 exchange about to list Catslap ($SLAP)? The whale news comes two days before a Ca tslap ‘major announcement,’ which will reveal the name of the centralized exchange(s) that will list the coin. Could it be that Jump Trading has an inside track on information regarding the CEX listing and is taking a position accordingly in preparation for a skyrocketing price? Catslap continues to trend on Tier 1 exchange Crypto.com – could it be the CEX in question, or maybe it is Binance or OKX? Slap-to-Earn, burning, buybacks, staking – there’s a lot going on with Catslap Catslap has released a torrent of product releases involving the initiation of a substantial burn program, advanced news of forthcoming Slap-to-Earn features, and the launch of a buyback dashboard detailing the team’s purchases in the open market to support the $SLAP price. The last burn saw 25 million tokens removed from circulation valued at $102,341. Altogether $158,107 worth of tokens have been burned , with the previous burn milestone of 10 million $SLAP worth $40,936. Including the burns from users ending their stakes early. Total $SLAP burned is 38,622,538. The next burn milestone will be when the Slapometer reaches 100,000,000 – when a colossal 100 million $SLAP tokens (worth more than $350,000 at the time of writing) will be thrown into the fire. Currently, the slap count stands at 69.3 million. In addition to the burning, the buyback program is purchasing $SLAP worth 0.13623 ETH every 20 minutes. The total buyback was $190,361 earlier today, equating to 46.3 million $SLAP bought. These buybacks are being used for burning and future community rewards. Only 11 days old, Catslap has already made a name for itself with its hilarious take on the slapping cat, which is growing in popularity. Simply connect the wallet that holds your $SLAP in order to take part in Slap-to-Earn – now when you click to slap, the slaps go towards your individual total for which you earn rewards. Users can slap without connecting their wallet and also click to slap but will earn no rewards. However, all slaps go towards the global total, which is then subdivided by country and ranked. At the moment the leading slapping countries are Japan, Malaysia, France, Turkey and Germany.

Zhao, released from a US prison in September after pleading guilty to charges of money laundering violations, has said that he has “no wish” to return as the company’s CEO. “No wish to be CEO again. But definitely wouldn’t mind a pardon,” Zhao stated. His response came after an X user opined that US President-Elect Donald Trump needed to pardon Zhao so he could rejoin the Binance exchange. “President [Trump] should consider a pardon for [CZ] so he can return to being the CEO of Binance and help the crypto industry mature and realize its full potential. He is also a victim of lawfare,” the user stated . Zhao stepped down from Binance last year as part of a $4 billion settlement with the US government. He was replaced by Richard Teng, the exchange’s current CEO. Plans to work with the Trump administration Zhao further stated that he would be happy to work with the Trump administration on plans to formulate friendly crypto policies in the United States. However, he clarified that he could not be appointed to head the crypto policy division for the Trump administration as he was not a US citizen. The statement comes amid ongoing discussions on who would be appointed to head this unit. During his campaign trail, Trump stated that he would form a crypto advisory council within the first 100 days to create a friendly and transparent regulatory climate. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has already been rumored to be a top pick for this position amid speculation of a meeting between the executive and Trump. Binance co-founder’s new venture Since his release from prison, Zhao has been adamant about launching a children’s platform dubbed Giggle Academy. Recently, the platform unveiled a competition in which winners will be rewarded with BNB tokens. Zhao previously said he would focus on this new initiative after his ouster from Binance. He has also unveiled plans to teach children about artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Zhao’s release from prison boded well for the BNB token, which has gained more than 180% over the past year.

37148685,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311351,1733172915,PlanB Doubles Down on Massive Bitcoin Price Prediction for Market Cycle Peak – Here’s His Outlook,"Popular quant analyst PlanB is doubling down on his prediction that Bitcoin ( BTC ) will surge to an astronomical value in the current bull market cycle. In a video update, the pseudonymous analyst tells his 188,000 YouTube subscribers that his stock-to-flow (S2F) model indicates Bitcoin may soon soar anywhere between $250,000 and $1 million. His stock-to-flow (S2F) model, which was traditionally used for traditional commodities before he adapted it to Bitcoin, predicts the performance of an asset based on the idea that price increases as the asset becomes more scarce. Historically, PlanB’s S2F model has forecasted the beginning of strong bull runs soon after the halving, when miners’ rewards are cut in half. “Right now we have the 2024 halving. I expect the same will happen this time. Obviously, there is a lag between the jump in model value and the market that has to adjust the prices over time. And, of course, there’s inertia in the markets… And of course, again, don’t look at the exact number. The number [after the 2020 halving] was $50,000 and it turned out to be on average $34,000, which is okay. It’s not spot on. It’s not precise at all. But if you take a margin of say two times the model value, $500,000 two times is $1 million, and you divide it by two, it’s $250,000, in that area that’s where I expect the average of this four-year period to end.” Source: PlanB/YouTube The analyst also notes his stock-to-flow model is predicting a higher cycle peak for BTC than many other analysts’ models. “And mind you that is a lot higher than most other models in the space, because there’s a lot of models that think we will have an even lower bull market than the last one, and that we will top out anywhere between $200,000 and $300,000 – so not the average, but the top – and then fall back to below $100,000 again in the later years.” Bitcoin is trading for $95,371 at time of writing, down 2.1% in the last 24 hours.

Why is XRP Rising?,"XRP rose to $2.84, its highest price in six years, making it the third most valuable cryptocurrency in the world. While it is still below its all-time high of $3.30 set in 2018, experts believe that XRP could surpass that record. Arthur Azizov, CEO of crypto exchange B2BinPay, listed several factors that led to XRP’s dramatic rise. Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election on November 5 has reignited bullish sentiment in the crypto market. Investors are betting that Trump will deliver on his pro-crypto promises, sending the market’s value up 42% to $3.5 trillion. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said Trump will “make crypto great again.” Since Trump's win, XRP has surged fivefold, outpacing gains by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. XRP’s recent price surge coincides with a surge in trading following Robinhood’s decision to relist the coin last month. The platform delisted XRP in 2020 amid regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, which accused Ripple of selling unregistered securities. Analysts say whale activity on Coinbase is also driving XRP’s rally. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju noted that XRP trading on Coinbase represents a price premium compared to retail-focused platforms like Upbit. Meanwhile, South Korean retail investors are largely contributing to the rally, with XRP trading volumes on exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb surpassing Bitcoin. Related News: Coinbase Announces Long-Awaited Feature: ""Could Attract More People"" SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s resignation, scheduled for Jan. 20, is seen as a positive sign for Ripple. Gensler’s tenure has been marked by a hostile stance toward cryptocurrencies, including Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the SEC. Azizov suggested that Gensler’s departure could pave the way for Ripple to resolve its regulatory issues and unlock further growth for XRP. While Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market has fallen from 60% to 53% in the past week, altcoins like XRP are benefiting from this shift. Historically, a decline in Bitcoin dominance alongside market expansion could signal the start of an “alt season,” where altcoins receive greater attention. Following the success of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs this year, XRP could be next. Companies like Bitwise, 21Shares, and WisdomTree have filed XRP ETF applications with the SEC. Ripple CEO Garlinghouse has called an XRP ETF “inevitable,” and analysts suggest that approval could significantly boost the price of XRP. With Trump taking office and potentially appointing a pro-crypto SEC chairman, market experts believe the regulatory path for XRP ETFs could become smoother. *This is not investment advice.

Chainlink will offer its oracle services for reliable pricing data, bridging on-chain events with financial information. In the past few months, Chainlink additionally researched business processes for fintech and trading companies, including investment banking giants. The on-chain oracle service aims to fetch data in ways that also lead to simpler business processes . 21X is preparing to launch a platform with Chainlink’s standard-setting approach to on-chain finance. Trading is not yet active but will operate under the regulation of the German financial authority, BaFin. Chainlink will supply its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which will help 21X settle assets from multiple chains. 21X considers stablecoins to be tokenized assets and will onboard stablecoins from multiple chains to offer to its clients. The platform is expected to launch in Q1, 2025, immediately tapping data on listed products from Chainlink. With this partnership, Chainlink joins the regulated crypto asset in Europe, connecting all acceptable assets with the tokenized ecosystem of 21X. 21X will be one of the few fintech companies to operate under the proposed EU distributed ledger technology (DLT) legal framework. The fintech firm aims to offer tokenized stocks, bonds, and funds. In addition to carrying tokens based on EU assets, 21X will bring contract-based issuance, trading, and settlement for those assets, as well as existing coins and tokens on selected public chains. The EU has strict requirements for stablecoins, one of the most common types of tokenized assets. For stocks, bonds, or funds, the EU has a sandbox regulation. In the past, EU-based companies have tried to offer security tokens, though the influence of those assets has been limited. LINK rallies ahead of December 10 announcement More news is riling up the long-standing Chainlink community. In the coming week, Chainlink is expected to attend the Abu Dhabi Finance Week and sign a Memorandum of understanding (MOU) with key partners. The still-unannounced partners are causing speculations, even mentioning BlackRock’s Larry Fink as a potential representative. Chainlink still carries more than 51% of all oracle services for crypto insiders and is making forays into the traditional financial ecosystem. Within crypto, Chainlink secures $37.29B in notional value, surpassing competitors like Chronicle and Pyth. Chainlink is also the most active oracle startup to research fintech companies and suggests solutions for pricing and trading data. Chainlink is also tied to the usage of stablecoins, which have grown their influence in the past year. The CCIP cross-chain platform focuses on USDC usage, tapping the most heavily regulated stablecoin. CCIP targets DeFi, carrying GHO tokens, WETH, ETHx, and other niche tokens with multi-chain representation. Chainlink (LINK) was one of the assets to rally as signs emerged of an active altcoin season. LINK moved above $23 on news of new integrations for its oracle services. LINK is one of the older assets to rally into a new price range. LINK recovered above $23.21, the highest level since January 2022. LINK broke its 2024 record and expanded its daily volumes above $7B in 24 hours. The spectacular recovery also led to a high turnover of LINK tokens, trading more than 50% of the supply in the past 24 hours. LINK follows the trend for older coins and tokens to rally, based on their high liquidity and reliable listings. The LINK rally follows the lead of XRP, and the expansion of older utility projects, including IOTA, EOS, Tezos, and others. The Chainlink community has shown readiness for long-term holding, in expectation of LINK breaking to a higher price range. LINK open interest is on track to break above $500M, repeating the peak from April 2024. LINK is expected to break its all-time high above $49, and then potentially move into price discovery above $100.

In an X post on Monday, Schiff pointed out that MicroStrategy has already spent $11.5 billion of its $42 billion Bitcoin ( BTC ) investment plan in just over a month. He questioned the sustainability of this pace, highlighting that Bitcoin prices remain below the highly anticipated $100,000 mark. As of Dec. 2, MicroStrategy holds approximately 402,100 BTC, which is valued at over $38 billion as of press time. Bitcoin is trading at around $96,000. Since announcing its three-year plan to spend $42 billion buying Bitcoin on Oct. 30, $MSTR has already spent $11.5 billion, or 27.4% of the entire plan, in just over a month. @saylor is blowing through this cash quickly, yet #Bitcoin remains below $100K. I wonder who's selling. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 2, 2024 MicroStrategy, led by Bitcoin proponent Michael Saylor, has positioned itself as a major institutional investor in Bitcoin. The company views Bitcoin as a value store akin to digital gold and a hedge against inflation. Since 2020, it has converted much of its corporate reserves along with billions of dollars of debt into Bitcoin. You might also like: WisdomTree files S-1 for spot XRP ETF with SEC Schiff’s logic Critics like Schiff argue that this strategy is risky, especially given Bitcoin’s volatility. Schiff has long opposed Bitcoin, favoring gold as a safer investment. His latest critique suggests that such massive purchases might be unsustainable, particularly if Bitcoin doesn’t reach higher price levels. On the other hand, Bitcoin supporters defend MicroStrategy’s strategy, emphasizing the cryptocurrency’s scarcity and potential for long-term growth. Schiff’s critique of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchases overlooks the company’s long-term strategy, which treats Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a scarce asset with the potential for value growth. While Schiff focuses on Bitcoin’s current price, MicroStrategy’s approach aligns with dollar-cost averaging — a method designed to reduce the impact of market volatility over time. Moreover, his skepticism does not consider that traditional investments, like gold, face similar criticisms regarding volatility and limited returns compared to other asset classes.

The company launched a podcast on November 19 to assist other firms in considering Bitcoin for their treasury reserves. Additionally, Genius Group will host an Investor Meeting on December 10, live from Bitcoin MENA 2024 in Abu Dhabi. During the meeting, Hamilton will share the company’s growth plans for 2025, including details on its “Bitcoin-First” Treasury Strategy and its AI-powered decentralized education network plan.

Similarly, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet, which holds more than 1,000 Bitcoin, revealed plans to buy more , funding the acquisition through one-year bonds worth 1.75 billion yen ($11.3 million). Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings (formerly Marathon Digital) also entered the Bitcoin reserve game, offering $700 million in convertible senior notes partly to acquire more Bitcoin.

Whether it’s their quirky branding, loyal fanbases, or the sheer thrill of watching them go viral, meme coins continue to dominate the scene. And this month, one presale, in particular, is making serious waves—BTFD Coin is taking centre stage, raising over $150,000 in just 24 hours with its price currently sitting at $0.000058. If you’re not paying attention to this presale, you’re missing out on what could be the breakout hit of the year. But BTFD Coin isn’t the only star of the show.

ShibaSwap, the platform’s native DEX, and projects like the SHIB Metaverse and Shibarium have turned Shiba Inu into a multifaceted powerhouse.

According to a Messari report, the Avalanche ( AVAX ) ecosystem witnessed an uptick in quarter-on-quarter metrics during Q3 2024. Compared to the year’s second quarter, the layer-1’s total value locked reached $1.5 billion due to a 66% increase. Daily transactions across sovereign layer-1 blockchains on Avalanche grew by 18%, as the stablecoin supply on AVAX surged by 31%. AVAX user progress was attributed to the so-called Avalanche9000, a network upgrade designed to simplify launching a layer-1. You might also like: Avalanche announces $40m grant program for L1 developers Avalanche uses a proof-of-stake smart contract architecture to power its “Avalanche Consensus,” a mode that supports an interconnected network of sovereign layer-1 chains. According to the protocol, Avalanche9000 will allow more builders to innovate with scalable technology without suffering traffic congestion issues. The upgrade shipped to AVAX’s Fuji testnet on Nov. 24, along with millions in retroactive rewards for active users and community members. Developers tentatively expect to deploy the upgrade to mainnet sometime in 2025. Furthermore, the L1 giant announced a $40 million grant program for layer-1 builders. Dubbed “Retro9000,” the initiative aims to attract blockchain founders to AVAX’s burgeoning ecosystem. On-chain growth for AVAX also filtered into the token’s market price. AVAX has surged 100% in the last 30 days and traded around $48.45 on Dec. 2.

Latest Report Released,"Cryptocurrency analytics firm Messari has published an in-depth report on Ripple (XRP) following the coin's recent rally. The report outlines key developments in XRP Ledger (XRPL), including advancements in smart contracts, stablecoin integration, and network activity trends. Smart Contract Integration: Ripple and the broader XRP community have announced plans to offer native smart contracts on XRPL through the upcoming XLS proposal. Stablecoin Launches: Ripple announced that its USD-pegged stablecoin RLUSD is in private beta on both XRPL and Ethereum. Native Lending Protocol: Development is underway for a lending protocol on XRPL. Users will be able to lend and borrow assets such as XRP, stablecoins, wBTC, and wETH through single-asset vaults. Decentralized Identity and Price Oracles: Recent changes to XRPL introduced decentralized identity (DID) capabilities for verifiable digital identities and price oracles for pricing bundled or bridged assets. Related News: Coinbase Announces Long-Awaited Feature: ""Could Attract More People"" Messari’s report revealed notable trends in XRPL’s network metrics in Q3: Transaction Volume Increase: Average daily transactions increased by 94% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to 1.7 million, driven primarily by detected microtransactions (less than 1 XRP). New Address Growth: Total new addresses increased by 10% QoQ to 105,000, but this metric is down 34% YoY compared to Q3 2023. Decline in Active Addresses: Total active addresses decreased by 3% compared to the previous quarter, while active sending addresses decreased by 20% compared to the previous quarter. In contrast, active receiving addresses increased by 7%. Messari noted that XRPL’s account creation and deletion dynamics are unique, as accounts require a deposit of 10 XRP to be created, which can only be reclaimed if deleted. This mechanism makes XRPL’s account metrics more reliable compared to other networks that are prone to zero-cost spam account creation. *This is not investment advice.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/mr-chill-doge-solana-memecoin-to-surge-14000-before-exchange-listing-as-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

After months of strategic discussions, the acquisition, completed for an undisclosed amount, positions the Dai Lo to harness Fractal’s groundbreaking ZK (zero knowledge) technology and revitalize its vision for the future. The acquisition encompasses Fractal’s robust technology portfolio, token reserves, intellectual property and most importantly, its dedicated community. By integrating these assets, The Dai Lo aims to expand upon the exceptional work initiated by Fractal’s founders and deliver transformative solutions. Gary Mitchell, the Dai Lo’s unofficial leader, said, “Fractal should be part of every technology stack in DeFi, AI and others on every chain possible. “Privacy is a killer app and should be an option on every application on every chain. Fractal aims to be used everywhere.” A strategic vision for Fractal Earlier this year, the Dai Lo embarked on a journey to explore groundbreaking projects in the Bitcoin, UTXO, BRC20 and Runes ecosystems. Fractal stood out as a project with immense potential but lacked the momentum to realize it fully. While Fractal demonstrated the capacity to operate as an independent layer-one or layer-two platform, its greatest value lies in serving as a foundational component for broader ecosystems, bridging blockchain and traditional Web 2.0 applications. With privacy as a core focus, Fractal’s technology is uniquely positioned to redefine the market. Gary Mitchell added, “It’s our belief that this project could achieve a $1 billion market cap or more. Our mission is to realize that potential and build a future where privacy is prioritized and celebrated.” Meet the Dai Lo The Dai Lo is a team of transformation specialists committed to identifying undervalued projects and driving them to success. Gary Mitchell – A startup veteran passionate about innovation, Mitchell brings a wealth of experience from the Ethereum, Cardano and Solana ecosystems and will dedicate his focus entirely to Fractal. Yeolin Han – A coding prodigy with expertise in UTXO chains and the RGBPP space, Han’s technical acumen will be instrumental in unlocking Fractal’s full potential. Plus, a team of about 10 developers with expertise in AI, ZK and other related technologies. The path forward Revitalizing Fractal’s community is the team’s top priority. Acknowledging frustrations from past mismanagement, the Dai Lo is committed to rebuilding trust, improving transparency and expanding the community with new supporters who align with the project’s vision. In tandem, the team is revisiting branding to return to Fractal’s roots as a privacy-focused project. With cutting-edge zero-knowledge technology in the pipeline, the long-term goal is to make Fractal scalable, reliable and user-friendly. Yeolin Han said, “Privacy isn’t just a feature – i t’s the foundation. Fractal will empower users to decide what remains public and what stays private, revolutionizing on-chain transaction privacy.” Acknowledgments and looking ahead With the dissolution of Discreet Labs, the organization behind Fractal, the Dai Lo expresses its gratitude to all contributors who laid the groundwork for this acquisition. Special thanks go to Sam Harrison for his instrumental role in finalizing the deal. The Dai Lo is excited to usher in a new era for Fractal, with ambitious plans to elevate the project to unprecedented heights. The team invites the community to join them in shaping the future of FRA and blockchain innovation. About Fractal Network Fractal Network is a multi-layer network committed to applying ZK cryptography at every level of the Web 3.0 stack.

VeChain (VET) Poised for Significant Growth as Altcoin Season Nears VeChain's price has been climbing, showing a 110.07% increase over the past month. Currently trading between $0.0334 and $0.0529, it stands above both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages. The Relative Strength Index is at 51.62, indicating steady momentum. A positive MACD level suggests further upward movement. The nearest resistance level is at $0.0598; breaking this could propel the price toward the next resistance at $0.0792. This jump would mean a substantial gain from the current price range. With these bullish signs and the altcoin market heating up, VeChain seems ready for significant growth. FET Soars Over 40% This Month, Targets $2.21 Resistance Level FET's price has surged 29.87% in the past week and 42.90% this month. Trading between $1.28 and $1.68, it shows strong upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index is at 50.75, indicating room for growth. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $1.87, above current prices, suggesting a bullish trend. If FET breaks the nearest resistance at $1.82, it could reach the next level at $2.21, a potential increase of over 30%. The positive MACD level of 0.01245 supports this outlook. With altcoin season approaching and a global crypto bull run expected, FET could be set for significant gains. Ondo (ONDO) Rallies 80% in a Month: Ready for a Breakout? Ondo (ONDO) has surged recently, showing an impressive 80.35% gain over the past month. Trading between $0.95 and $1.15, it's approaching its nearest resistance at $1.24. The RSI stands at 55.04, indicating room for further upward movement before hitting overbought levels. A break above $1.24 could see ONDO targeting the second resistance at $1.44, offering potential gains of around 25%. The MACD positive at 0.0083 suggests bullish momentum is building. With the altcoin season looming and a global crypto bull run anticipated, ONDO might continue its ascent, making it a coin to watch closely in the coming weeks. Uniswap (UNI) Poised for Breakout Amid Bullish Market Signals Uniswap (UNI) is showing strong upward momentum, with a 1-month price jump of 73.66%. Currently trading between $9.14 and $12.01, UNI is consolidating before a potential surge. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages at $13.09 and $12.84 indicate an upward trend. The Relative Strength Index stands at 58.37, suggesting more room for growth before reaching overbought territory. Breaking the nearest resistance level at $13 could propel UNI toward the next resistance at $16, representing an increase of over 30% from current levels. With altcoin season on the horizon and a bullish global crypto market, UNI may be set for significant gains. Conclusion While VET, FET, ONDO, and UNI show promise, their short-term potential may be limited. In contrast, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to all. Offering a potential 700% ROI during its presale and triple utility features, Catzilla invites participation in the fight against crypto villains.

37148005,https://blockworks.co/news/btc-november-recap-december-outlook,1733171400,What to watch for in December after an eventful November,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . November was an eventful month for crypto, as you know — jumpstarted by Donald Trump’s election win . Bitcoin rose 37.3% last month, CoinGlass data shows. That was the asset’s best performance in November (the month with the highest average BTC returns, at 46%) since 2020, when bitcoin gained 43%. Looking ahead, December is not historically as good a month for BTC (+4.9% returns on average). Bitcoin price did rise by 47% in December 2020 (also after a presidential election); but from 2021 to 2023, the asset’s returns were -18.9%, -3.6% and +12.2%, respectively. Bitcoin has been unable to breach the $100,000 level — with some analysts attributing that to investor profit-taking, as well as put option-fueled resistance as traders hedge against possible dips. BTC was trading around $95,650 at 2 pm ET — down 1.6% from 24 hours prior. Jeff Embry, managing director of crypto hedge fund Globe 3 Capital, told me he does not necessarily expect specific developments this month to impact crypto markets. Rather, he predicts “an across-the-board continuation” from November of strong crypto demand spurred by the US “taking its boot off the throats of the innovators, risk takers and investors and telling them ‘we support you now.’” “Before November, the most recent peaks for BTC and ETH were in mid-March,” he explained. “That is an eight-month consolidation period in a bull market, so that market was ready for a catalyst to push to new highs, and the November election provided that catalyst in a gigantic way.” Globe 3 Capital’s end-of-year BTC price prediction (proclaimed at the start of 2024) was $124,000 — a number Embry said the firm is sticking to. Some others have pointed to $80,000 as a support level in the case of a drawdown. “Of course, higher prices depend on higher demand and we are seeing demand across the board from retail , [high-net-worth individuals], institutions, sovereign wealth funds and governments themselves,” Embry added. We certainly saw plenty of examples in November of companies buying BTC for their treasuries. That appears set to continue. From Nov. 25 to Dec. 1, MicroStrategy bought 15,400 bitcoins for roughly $1.5 billion in cash, according to a Monday filing . Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital revealed (also today) it intends to offer $700 million of convertible senior notes — the proceeds of which will primarily go toward buying more BTC. MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor shared a video explaining why Microsoft should hold BTC on its balance sheet . Such a proposal is on the tech giant’s agenda for its Dec. 10 shareholder meeting; though the board recommends a vote against it (noting it already considers this), it’s something to keep an eye on. Then there’s the Federal Reserve’s rate decision on Dec. 18. Polymarket odds suggest the market expects a 25-basis point decrease (67% chance). Rate cuts have historically been good for risk assets like bitcoin. Finally, the industry continues to await clarity around a possible US strategic bitcoin reserve. To Embry’s point about governments showing interest , US support for this would likely lead to more countries doing the same . But analysts at Compass Point Research & Trading believe the BITCOIN Act ( floated by Sen. Cynthia Lummis) has a less than 10% chance of becoming law. “We do not expect the Republican-controlled Congress, which will be focused on expiring tax provisions and the federal budget, to allocate funds for this purpose,” Joe Flynn and Ed Groshans wrote. “The primary challenge this action would encounter is the deficit financing of BTC purchases.” Though Trump could issue an executive order (perhaps creating a subaccount within the Treasury’s general fund), they added, a future administration could undo the action.

Technical indicators point to bullish momentum, with the RSI at 63.11 and a positive MACD level of 13.43. The price is approaching the nearest resistance level at $3770. Breaking this could see Ethereum target the next resistance at $4242. Simple moving averages over the last 10 and 100 days are above $3600, supporting upward movement. With a 10.20% gain in the last week, Ethereum shows strong potential for further growth. The bullish trend suggests it may continue to rise, possibly reaching new highs soon. Algorand (ALGO) Experiences Remarkable 319% Growth in One Month Algorand's price has surged recently, fluctuating between $0.20 and $0.35. Over the past month, ALGO's price jumped by 319.27%, and in the last week alone, it increased by 63.83%. The Relative Strength Index is at 59.41, indicating moderate market momentum. The nearest resistance level is $0.41, with a second at $0.56, while the nearest support is at $0.12. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.47, surpassing the 100-day average of $0.38, which suggests an upward trend. The MACD level of 0.0153 also reflects positive movement. These figures highlight ALGO's significant growth potential in the current market climate. Worldcoin (WLD) Poised to Break Resistance Amid Bullish Momentum Worldcoin (WLD) is trading between $2.15 and $2.82, showing strong momentum with a 1-week price increase of 38.42% and a 1-month rise of 76.46%. The RSI is at 52.25, indicating neutral market sentiment, while the MACD is positive at 0.0394, suggesting upward potential. The nearest resistance level is $3.09; breaking this could see WLD reach the second resistance at $3.75, a potential gain of over 30% from current prices. The SMA for 10 days is $3.41, and for 100 days is $2.96, both above the current price, indicating room for growth. With altcoin season approaching, WLD might surge past resistance levels.

Special target groups, such as small merchants and vulnerable consumers, are being prioritized. To further explore the potential of a digital euro, the ECB is forming partnerships with merchants, fintech companies, universities, and other stakeholders. An outcome report detailing these activities is expected in July 2025. What’s Next for the Digital Euro? ECB Reveals Plans and Partnerships as 2025 Deadline Nears The ECB has also concluded a call for applications to identify potential providers for the digital euro’s components and services. This selection process, launched in January , has reached the evaluation phase. Once finalized in 2025, the results will be published on the ECB’s website. Features such as fair transaction fees, high consumer privacy, and support for the European payments ecosystem show its potential impact. While the project began in July 2021 , progress has been slow, with delays in establishing the necessary legal framework. Nearly 17 months after the European Commission’s proposal, the framework remains incomplete, raising concerns among ECB officials. Globally, 134 countries, representing 98% of the world’s economy , are exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), with 66 already in pilot stages. While the ECB continues to refine its approach, the final decision on launching a digital euro rests with the ECB’s Governing Council and will depend on legislative developments.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin started in 2013 as a joke. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin was made to be abundant. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there's no maximum limit. What began as a fun and friendly cryptocurrency quickly gained a loyal community. In 2021, Dogecoin's value soared, reaching over $50 billion in market cap. This surge was fueled by social media buzz and support from celebrities like Elon Musk. Dogecoin's technology is based on Litecoin, allowing for quick and easy transactions. Its plentiful supply makes it great for small online transactions and tipping content creators. Some see Dogecoin as a symbol of how online communities can shape markets. In the current crypto market, Dogecoin continues to be popular. Compared to other coins, it offers a lighthearted entry into cryptocurrency. While it started as a meme, its growth shows that even a joke can make a big impact. SPX6900 (SPX) In a world where digital numbers can outweigh gold, SPX6900 has emerged from the depths of internet culture. This meme token has set an audacious goal: to topple the S&P 500 by reaching a staggering $69 trillion market cap. The logic is delightfully simple—6900 is greater than 500, so SPX6900 must be infinitely better than traditional investments. Riding on this whimsical reasoning, SPX6900 embarks on a journey toward financial domination, powered by the belief that bigger numbers make better investments. But does SPX6900 have a place in the current market cycle? With the rise of meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, there's a growing appetite for playful yet promising tokens. SPX6900 taps into this trend, blending humor with ambition. Its potential lies not just in its lofty goals but in its ability to capture the imagination of investors looking for the next big (or amusing) thing. In a market that celebrates innovation and bold ideas, SPX6900 stands out as an attractive option for those ready to embrace a meme-fueled financial adventure. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a new memecoin making waves on the Ethereum blockchain. Inspired by Matt Furie's Pepe the Frog, a meme that gained internet fame in the early 2000s, this cryptocurrency embraces its playful roots. Aiming to join the ranks of popular meme-based coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, PEPE stands out with a no-tax policy and a straightforward approach. It doesn't claim to have utilitarian value; instead, it keeps things simple and fun, appealing to enthusiasts who appreciate its meme culture origins. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced a remarkable surge, with its market cap soaring to $1.6 billion. Early adopters saw significant gains, and a vibrant community formed around the coin. This explosive growth contributed to what some call a ""memecoin season,"" where numerous meme-inspired tokens rapidly rose and fell in value. PEPE's roadmap is ambitious yet focused, aiming for listings on major exchanges and a ""meme takeover."" Though the future is uncertain, PEPE's rise reflects current market trends where community-driven projects capture attention. As the crypto world anticipates the next Bitcoin halving and a potential bull run, coins like PEPE showcase the dynamic and unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency markets. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin's fun and meme culture. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator named Ryoshi, it runs on the Ethereum blockchain, tapping into its vast ecosystem. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's Ethereum base allows for more possibilities. At launch, one quadrillion SHIB tokens were created. Half were sent to Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's co-founder, to build trust. Buterin donated a large portion to COVID relief and ""burned"" 40% of the supply, removing them from circulation. These actions put SHIB in the spotlight. SHIB's integration with Ethereum means it can do more than be a meme coin. It supports decentralized applications like ShibaSwap, where users can trade tokens without a middleman. Plans include an NFT platform and a system where holders can help make decisions. These developments give SHIB potential beyond trading. In the current market, as cryptocurrencies seek real-world use, SHIB's alignment with Ethereum could make it more attractive than other meme coins. While the crypto market is volatile, SHIB's growing ecosystem might appeal to those looking for coins with community buzz and technological promise. Conclusion Though DOGE, SPX, PEPE, and SHIB are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely combines meme culture with sports, aiming for massive growth and offering early adopters significant advantages.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen significant price movement recently. Over the past week, its price surged by 18.68%, and over the past month, it soared by 72.37%. However, over the last six months, the price change is a more modest 26.10%. This suggests SHIB has been gaining momentum in the short term. Currently, SHIB trades between $0.0000231667 and $0.0000282767. The nearest resistance is at $0.0000307733, about 8% above the current high. The nearest support is at $0.0000205533, roughly 11% below the current low. Breaking above resistance could target $0.0000358833, around 27% higher. Falling below support might see $0.0000154433, approximately 33% lower. Currently trading between $0.76 and $1.22, Cardano faces its nearest resistance at $1.41, about 16% above the current high. Breaking this could see the price aiming for the second resistance at $1.86, which is approximately 52% higher. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.51, around 33% below the current low. The second support at $0.0526 is much lower, marking a significant drop if reached. Considering its recent performance, ADA might test resistance levels soon, signaling potential growth ahead. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) has been on the move lately. In the past week, its price shifted by a modest 0.56%, showing stability after recent gains. Over the past month, ADA skyrocketed by 214.66%, and over six months, it increased by 134.28%. This surge highlights growing interest and strong performance in the market. Looking at the technical indicators, the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $1.06 and $1.04 respectively, suggesting consistent price levels. The Relative Strength Index stands at 51.61, indicating a balanced market without extreme buying or selling pressure. The Stochastic oscillator at 60.52 supports this neutral stance. With a MACD level of -0.001972, there's a slight bearish momentum, but it's minimal. Based on this data, ADA's price may continue to rise or consolidate around current levels. Currently trading between $0.76 and $1.22, Cardano faces its nearest resistance at $1.41, about 16% above the current high. Breaking this could see the price aiming for the second resistance at $1.86, which is approximately 52% higher. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.51, around 33% below the current low. The second support at $0.0526 is much lower, marking a significant drop if reached. Considering its recent performance, ADA might test resistance levels soon, signaling potential growth ahead.

37147295,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373040,1733170133,Pump.fun Faces $22M Revenue Crash Amid Livestream Controversy,"Pump.fun, the popular Solana-based meme coin launchpad, has seen its fortunes plummet following a series of alarming incidents tied to its livestream feature. The platform seems to be grappling with the fallout from a decision to temporarily pause its livestream function after users broadcast disturbing content in a bid to pump their tokens’ values. Weekly Income Nosedives Information from decentralized finance (DeFi) data aggregator DefiLlama shows that between November 18 and November 24, Pump.fun generated an impressive $33.83 million in revenue, the highest since its launch in early 2024. The figure represented a 60% increase from the prior week and a 400% jump since the beginning of November, as meme coin mania hit the broader crypto market. However, the following week saw a dramatic $22.52 million reversal, with proceeds plunging to $11.31 million, the lowest the platform recorded since the end of October. Despite the dip, the $82.78 million raised in November, per DefiLlama, is still the highest amount Pump.fun has raked in across a 30-day period since it opened to the public. Monthly returns have been on a steady rise since March, with only a slight contraction in September, when they went down to $14.41 million, being the only blip. In that time, the meme coin launcher has earned more than $227 million in revenue. The weekly income slump was also accompanied by a significant dip in the number of tokens launched on Pump.fun during that period. On November 30, according to data from Dune, only 34,359 were created, a 50% drop from a record 69,046 registered just ten days earlier on November 20. Exploitative Livestreams The decline came against the backdrop of Pump.fun’s decision to suspend its livestream feature amid rising concerns over harmful behavior. Originally intended to help developers promote their projects, some seemingly abused the feature by airing acts ranging from threats of self-harm to extreme violence. One incident involved a developer claiming they would commit suicide if their token failed to hit a specific market cap. At the same time, another allegedly threatened to harm a pet in exchange for their project’s success. In another incident, a user had to be hospitalized for several days after sustaining severe burns when he doused himself in isopropyl and set off fireworks during a live broadcast to promote the TruthOrDare (DARE) meme coin. However, following public outcry, the Pump.fun team issued a community note on November 24, acknowledging the disturbing nature of the events. They also announced that they would indefinitely pause the platform’s livestream feature, promising to work on its moderation tools to prevent such content from being broadcast in the future.

It aims to empower the Solana community by shifting influence from venture capital tokens to users. After a significant surge following its listing on Coinbase, BONK established itself as a community coin, distributing half of its supply to participants in Solana's projects. By December 2023, it became the third-largest memecoin by market value, with a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Its integration into the Solana ecosystem and involvement in applications like BonkSwap suggest potential for further growth. BONK's performance indicates it may be an attractive option in the current market cycle. PEPE: A Deflationary Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin on the Ethereum network, inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme. It aims to mirror the success of memecoins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. PEPE stands out by having no transaction taxes and by focusing solely on its identity as a memecoin without utility. It reached a market cap of $1.6 billion in mid-2023, showing significant interest from crypto enthusiasts. The coin employs a burning mechanism to increase scarcity and rewards long-term holders through redistribution. As an ERC-20 token, it benefits from Ethereum's security. PEPE's potential hinges on community engagement and memecoin trends. Its attractiveness in the current market cycle depends on investor interest in memecoins. Conclusion Despite limited short-term potential for BONK and PEPE, DOGEN targets those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by presale's end, with potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season, DOGEN follows the success of tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat.

37147437,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315404,1733169779,Strong Buy Indicators as Analyst Predicts Cardano Could Hit $10 This Cycle – How Soon Will It Happen?,"Cardano (ADA) just hit new more than two-and-a-half-year highs above $1.24, as the buyers pile in on growing calls for the ADA price to hit $10 this cycle. The ADA price is up over 250% since US President-elect Donald Trump’s victory early last month, as traders bet that a shift to pro-crypto policy in the US will benefit Cardano and its ecosystem. Widely followed crypto YouTuber Lark Davis was recently bullish on the prospect of more gains for ADA. Cardano is getting the attention and hype required to send it as high as $10 this cycle, he said in a recent video. BREAKING: Lark Davis says "" #Cardano 's getting the attention and the hype, we could see $10.00 $ADA ."" pic.twitter.com/oOpCx0DuI6 — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) November 29, 2024 Right now, the ADA price is grappling with resistance in the $1.25 area in the form of the March 2022 highs. But should this break, the door would open for a fast surge back to record highs above $3.0. That would mark a 10x rally from the coin’s pre-Trump victory levels. The impressive gains come as Cardano pivots to trying to market itself as the DeFi chain for Bitcoin . There is also a chance that the blockchain’s founder Charles Hopkinson may play an important role in crypto policymaking in the upcoming Trump administration. Cardano founder, Charles Hoskinson will be working with Donald Trump on crypto policy. Are you beginning to understand? pic.twitter.com/RosDqO6euZ — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) November 10, 2024 That would presumably come as a major boost Cardano and its broader ecosystem. How Soon Could Cardano Hit $10? A rally to $10 would mark gains of nearly 10x from current levels. Investors coming from the traditional finance space would be forgiven for assuming it might take years or even decades for an asset to achieve such returns. Well, this is crypto. And Cardano is an “alt-coin”. And when altcoin markets start moving, they can go a very long way in a very short period of time. Just look at ADA’s move in the last month – a more than 250% gain in just a few weeks. In early 2021, it only took ADA just over four months to post gains of over 1,000% to rally from around $0.20 to nearly $2.50. The major pro-crypto shift anticipated in the US regulatory regime in 2025 has altcoin markets already buzzing, with altcoin season likely already having begun. Its not out of the question that ADA hits $10 sometime before the middle of 2025. The prospect of 10x gains would have many investors frothing at the mouth. But for a certain breed of crypto degenerates, that is chump change. These traders are hunting for the next 100x project that will make them rich, fast. Getting into a new meme coin before it really starts to trend is one of the best ways to bag 100x or more gains in crypto. But traders often make the mistake of FOMOing into a micro-cap meme coin they see moving on DEXScreener or a similar platform. More often than not, they will end up FOMOing into an illegitimate project that ends up as either a scam or pump-and-dump. A better alternative might be to check out meme coin presales. Presales offer a few key advantages over coins launched directly to the DEX. They normally run for a few weeks, giving investors ample time to do their research properly. Meanwhile, funds raised can go towards marketing and other exciting product/community development efforts, raising the chance the coin really goes viral. Analysts at cryptonews.com keep a close eye on the meme coin presale market. And one of their top picks right now is an exciting new vote-to-earn decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-powered meme coin called Flockerz (FLOCK) .

37146986,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656254,1733169626,Altcoins Poised For December Gains As Bitcoin Loses Ground: Analyst,"Although Bitcoin remains the world’s top digital asset, its price oscillating between $90k and $96k this week, some experts are looking ahead and beyond Bitcoin . According to some crypto commentators over Twitter/X, Bitcoin’s market dominance is dipping, which means that altcoin season is about to start. In a post by MikyBull Crypto, Bitcoin’s market dominance falls below its two-year support line, creating plenty of opportunities for holders and traders. According to TradingView, Bitcoin’s current dominance is 56.67%, from last week’s 57%, breaking through its support level for two years. Analysts say that the continuous dip in Bitcoin’s dominance will impact the general crypto market this December and onwards. On-chain and market data suggest that altcoins are poised for a market run, with MikyBull Crypto saying that its season started November 30th. Wow, Bitcoin dominance has just broken down the 2-year support. We are indeed officially in #ALTSEASON folks! https://t.co/IYfQF7P7XI pic.twitter.com/fVysBYuOKn — Mikybull Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) November 30, 2024 A Look At Bitcoin Market Dominance In crypto, analysts and market participants use a variety of metrics to assess Bitcoin’s performance. Bitcoin dominance is one reliable metric used to determine the relative market share of the asset in the crypto sector. The higher the percentage share of BTC, the better it is for holders and investors. However, Bitcoin’s dominance score has been dipping in recent weeks. As of December 2nd, it is at 55.3%, compared to 58.9% last month. According to MikyBull Crypto, Bitcoin has dipped below its two-year support. A declining Bitcoin dominance offers insights into the traders’ and investors’ strategies. One takeaway is that investors are reallocating their cash to other digital assets. Many analysts say that some of these investors are reallocating funds to altcoins, like XRP , which is now surging. Analysts say investors are potentially diversifying their funds and looking at other high-growth coin alternatives. Analysts And Crypto Commentators Offer Differing Insights A few altcoins are currently leading the market surge. Ether is experiencing a spike in price and increased demand for leveraged ETH exchange-traded funds. On-chain data shows the product experienced a 160% increase in demand immediately after the November 5th US elections. Analysts remain bullish on ETH, and many expect the asset to hit $4k soon. Then, there’s XRP, which trades above the $2 level. Pav Hundal of Swyftx offers a conservative opinion, saying that Bitcoin’s dominance score may still hit 65%, 67%, or even 70% before it declines. He argues that complex factors make it impossible to pick the right date for altcoin’s surge or Bitcoin’s decline. Not All Analysts See An Altcoin Surge Soon Meanwhile, not all crypto commentators agree that altcoins’ surge will come in days. Ki Young Ju of CryptoQuant advises caution on times like this. The CryptoQuant CEO remains bullish on Bitcoin, adding that there’s still institutional support for Bitcoin, and it’s unlikely that they will refocus on speculative assets. The CEO added that for altcoins to reach all-time high market caps, these assets need a considerable capital inflow to cryptocurrency exchanges. He said that altcoins must develop strategies to earn capital instead of relying on Bitcoin’s lack of momentum.

According to the SEC filing document , the WisdomTree XRP fund will be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. The Bank of New York Mellon serves as the administrator, fund accountant, and transfer agent for WisdomTree XRP ETF . “The Trust’s investment objective is to gain exposure to the price of XRP, less expenses and liabilities of the Trust’s operations. In seeking to achieve its investment objective, the Trust will hold XRP and will value its Shares daily,” WisdomTree wrote within its S-1 filing. Though WisdomTree has not unveiled a ticker symbol for the XRP ETF, the firm explained through the filing that the shares will be sold or redeemed in blocks of 5,000 shares based on the quantity of XRP attributable to each share. You might also like: WisdomTree files for XRP ETF in Delaware The WisdomTree ETF would track the XRP ( XRP ) price, which is currently the third-largest crypto asset by market value, just below Bitcoin and Ethereum. WisdomTree’s filing comes a week after the firm established a trust entity in Delaware for the proposed fund. At that time, no formal application had been submitted to the SEC . In order to bring a new ETF class into the market, WisdomTree must submit a 19b-4 Form. The firm would need the SEC’s approval for both the S-1 and 19b-4 Forms before the XRP ETF can list and trade on national exchanges. Though, that remains to be seen as XRP’s developer firm Ripple Labs is still engaged in an ongoing legal battle with the SEC that has been building up since 2020. WisdomTree is not the first firm to attempt to introduce more crypto ETF offerings beyond Bitcoin( BTC ) and Ethereum( ETH ). Bitwise has gone further in its effort to bring XRP ETF’s into the market after filing an S-1 Form on Nov. 26. In early November, 21Shares also did the same for an XRP-based fund amid skepticism toward crypto ETF demand outside Bitcoin products. Meanwhile, Canary Capital has also sought approval for ETFs based on assets like Solana( SOL ), Litecoin, and HBAR.

37146902,https://thecoinrise.com/hong-kong-bitcoin-etf-hits-a-trading-volume-milestone-in-november/,1733169206,Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs Hits A Trading Volume Milestone in November,"In a significant development, three Bitcoin spot ETF products on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) set a new market record. The digital investment product has recently recorded a monthly trading volume of $154 million, valued at 1.2 billion HKD in November 2024. This milestone reflects the increasing interest and confidence in Bitcoin-related investment products. It is particularly significant for a region that has only recently embraced cryptocurrency ETFs. Key Players Driving the Bitcoin ETF Surge in Hong Kong Many investors are riding on Hong Kong’s defined push for varied crypto derivatives offerings to go all out on Bitcoin ETFs. Three Bitcoin spot ETFs are leading the charge in this historic surge. This includes the ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF, Bosera Hashkey Bitcoin ETF, and Harvest Bitcoin Spot ETF. Together, these ETFs account for most of the trading volume. In particular, ChinaAMC, launched under the Huaxia Fund umbrella, has been the dominant player. This digital product is responsible for a significant portion of the monthly trading volume. As of December 2, ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF had recorded an impressive trading volume of 2.02 million shares, each priced at 11.89 HKD. This positions ChinaAMC as the clear leader among the three ETFs. Meanwhile, Harvest Bitcoin Spot ETF is the second-largest contributor, with 162,500 shares traded on December 2 at 11.96 HKD per share. Bosera Hashkey Bitcoin ETF, while contributing to the overall volume, saw a trading volume of 64,680 shares, with its shares priced at HKD 74.58. ChinaAMC and Harvest International alone accounted for about 88% of the total trading volume in November, around 1.06 billion HKD, equivalent to $136 million. These ETFs have been at the forefront of the market’s growth, capturing the lion’s share of investor interest. Hong Kong ETF Market: A Growing Market with Room to Expand Despite the impressive numbers, Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs are still far from reaching the scale of their U.S. counterparts. This includes the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF. These digital investment products boast average daily trading volumes of 40 million shares and 3.8 million shares, respectively. These volumes significantly surpass those seen in Hong Kong, showing the stark contrast in market size and investor activity levels. However, Hong Kong’s growth trajectory indicates its BTC ETFs are set for expansion, with rising investor interest likely boosting volumes soon. Hong Kong’s Strategic Positioning in the Crypto World Since their launch, Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong have steadily gained momentum , reflecting the region’s growing appeal as a cryptocurrency hub. The primary goal behind approving these funds was to offer local and international investors a secure and transparent platform for trading digital assets. November’s record-breaking trading volumes underscore this success, signaling strong investor enthusiasm for the digital asset market. Now firmly established in the global crypto landscape, Hong Kong is poised to attract increasing attention from cryptocurrency investors worldwide.

37146524,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311290,1733168758,South Korea Opposition Party Agrees to Two-Year Moratorium on Crypto Asset Taxation: Report,"South Korea’s opposition party has reportedly agreed to delay the implementation of a new policy that imposes a tax on cryptocurrency earnings starting January 2025. The Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) previously pushed back against the ruling People Power Party’s (PPP) proposal to postpone crypto asset taxation, which was supposed to take effect in 2021 but has already been put on hold twice. The DPK initially suggested increasing the tax threshold from 2.5 million won, or $1,784, to 50 million won ($35,688) instead of delaying the taxation of crypto gains, but the opposition is now changing its stance. The Korea Herald reports that during a press conference on Sunday, DPK floor leader, Representative Park Chan-dae, said his party no longer opposes the proposal to postpone the implementation of the crypto tax. “We have decided to agree to a two-year moratorium on the implementation of the cryptocurrency taxation proposed by the government and ruling party.” In July of this year, 13 representatives submitted a proposal to delay crypto taxation by three years, citing an anemic market at the time. “However, with investment sentiment toward virtual assets deteriorating, some argue that hasty taxation of virtual assets is not desirable right now, as virtual assets are high-risk assets with a higher risk of loss than stocks, and if income tax is also imposed, most investors are expected to leave the market. Accordingly, the tax enforcement date for virtual asset income, currently scheduled to be taxed from January 1, 2025, will be postponed for three years to January 1, 2028 (Article 37, Paragraph 5 of the Bill).” But with recent developments, South Korea may start taxing crypto income as early as 2027.

In a space dominated by dog-themed coins, new players like BTFD Coin, Apu Apustaja, and Cat in a Dog’s World are shaking things up in ways no one saw coming. Each of these projects brings something fresh to the table, with strong community backing and exciting growth prospects. BTFD Coin is breaking barriers with its record-breaking presale, offering a mix of high APY staking and a unique P2E game concept . Meanwhile, Apu Apustaja, inspired by its viral meme roots, is rallying a community of thousands and gaining traction among first-time crypto investors. Not to be outdone, Cat in a Dog’s World is proving that felines have a place in the meme coin universe, riding high on a Solana integration. With so many choices, it’s worth digging deeper into what makes these meme coins stand out. Whether you’re chasing the next big thing or just looking for the best meme coins to invest in this weekend, here’s the rundown on why BTFD Coin, Apu Apustaja, and Cat in a Dog’s World are stealing the spotlight. Why Everyone Is Talking About BTFD Coin and Its Mind-Boggling Presale Success BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a powerhouse in the making. Since its presale began on November 26, 2024, BTFD Coin has been generating buzz for all the right reasons. Launching at an initial price of $0.000004 per coin, it has advanced swiftly through its presale stages. Within the first 24 hours, the project raised over $150,000, marking a significant milestone early in its journey. By the end of the first week, it reached the 6th stage, with the price increasing to $0.000058. So far, the presale has raised over $600,000, attracted more than 1,500 enthusiastic holders, and sold an impressive 16 billion $BTFD coins . But BTFD Coin isn’t relying on hype alone. Its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, “Raging Bull,” promises to bring fun and utility when it launches in Stage 8, allowing players to earn rewards while gaming. Staking enthusiasts are already cashing in on the 90% APY program introduced in Stage 4, which offers unmatched returns for those willing to lock their tokens. To sweeten the deal, the project’s referral program gives both the referrer and referee a 10% bonus in BTFD tokens for purchases over $50. Now, let’s talk numbers. Imagine putting down $5,600 in Stage 6 when the price was $0.000058 per coin. That would’ve landed you approximately 96,551,724 BTFD tokens. By the time the presale wraps up and the price hits $0.0006, your investment would be worth a staggering $57,931. That’s a tenfold return—proof that early adopters could see life-changing gains. With so many features already in motion and a growing community of “bulls,” BTFD Coin is fast becoming one of the best meme coins to invest in this weekend.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-loves-russia-solana-memecoin-to-explode-17000-before-exchange-listing-as-shib-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

According to a new CNBC report, Coinbase’s Faryar Shirzad expects the US to begin enacting crypto regulations under Trump very quickly. At a recent Stand with Crypto event in the UK, Shirzard told CNBC that the Republican congress will easily approve pro-crypto measures. “We have the most pro-crypto Congress ever [in] history, we have an extraordinarily pro-crypto president coming into office. I think the combination should finally allow the 50 million Americans who own crypto to have their interests and voice heard in policy.” Congress is currently looking at two major pieces of crypto-related regulations, including the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act and the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act. According to Shirzad, the Republican congress is likely to pass botch acts rapidly. Crypto Political Action Committees (PACs) raised over $245 million for this year’s US Presidential election, reports CNBC. Last week, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said that Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler wanted to destroy the crypto industry. “Warren and Gensler tried to unlawfully kill our entire industry, and it was a major factor in the Democrats losing the election.

This transfer, stemming from a wallet linked to the Silk Road dark web marketplace, marks the latest in a series of large-scale Bitcoin movements by the government. Bitcoin price taps $94,497 following the transfer This large-scale move was executed in two phases, starting with a small test transfer of 0.001 BTC, worth roughly $97, followed by a much larger transaction of 19.8K BTC, approximately $1.92 billion. Source: Arkham The Bitcoin was initially sent to an intermediary wallet before making its way to Coinbase, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. This is not the first such transaction by the US government. In August 2024, 10,000 bitcoins, valued at $600 million at the time, were also moved from the same wallet to Coinbase, further fueling speculation about the government’s ongoing involvement in the cryptocurrency market. The US government’s crypto activities have continued to shape market sentiment, with the movement of such large amounts of Bitcoin often leading to fluctuations in the price of the cryptocurrency. The latest Bitcoin transfer caused Bitcoin price to plummet to $94,497 before slightly rebounding to $95,374 at press time. US government still has large crypto holdings The wallet from which the Bitcoin was transferred, which was originally tied to Silk Road—a now-defunct online marketplace known for facilitating illegal activities such as drug and weapon trades—still contains an estimated $18 billion worth of crypto. Aside from about 188.409k Bitcoin, the US authorities are also holding other crypto assets, including approximately 59.568k Ethereum, valued at about $213.27 million, and 122.131 million USDT, a popular stablecoin.

Charts Mirror 2021 Explosion, But This AI Rival Is Already Surging","As investors in the ever-evolving crypto market look for the next big thing, these coins have emerged as top picks of the season. Dogecoin has caught the attention of investors with its latest yield-earning utility. Meanwhile, already raising over $2.5 million in presale, IntelMarkets is gaining massive momentum for its potential to deliver exponential returns in 2025. DOGE meets BTC: Earn Yields with New Staking Protocol Exciting news for Dogecoin (DOGE) enthusiasts! – GOAT Network, a Bitcoin layer 2 scaling project, will allow users to stake their DOGE to earn yields. Through this staking feature, investors can now earn passive income on this platform by utilizing their DOGE shares. The platform whose mainnet is yet to be released allows users to earn network rewards through staking by utilizing BTC. Within the ecosystem, bitcoin holders can engage in various decentralized finance activities such as lending or trading, and earn while maintaining the ownership of their assets. Now, the protocol aims to let Dogecoin (DOGE) users in on this opportunity, by allowing them to stake their coins to earn fixed yields in BTC. In the future, the platform aims to introduce more financial applications for meme coins to provide better rewards for DOGE holders. In a statement to Coindesk on Wednesday, GOAT Network announced this latest development. By adding DOGE into its ecosystem, the platform wants to be known as “the home of people’s coins.” As Dogecoin continues to evolve and expand from its meme coin origin, the DOGE community is growing stronger. DOGE is currently trading on the market at $0.4028. Despite enjoying a massive rally after the US presidential election and Elon Musk’s support, the Dogecoin price surge has seemed to slow down.

XRP, HBAR, KAIA lead gains after Bitcoin consolidation","Altcoins took center stage as Bitcoin continued to consolidate under the coveted $100,000 mark, signalling that the highly anticipated altseason might finally be here. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin demonstrated a lot of volatilty, trading between $94,878 – $98,145 before finding its footing above $96,000 at press time. There was a lot of Bitcoin buying activity over the past few days but most it came from institutions as retails investors deviated towards altcoins. Bitcoin’s market dominance also slipped to the low 50’s, typical sign that liquidity was moving away from the benchmark crypto. According to anonymous crypto analyst ‘BATMAN,’ Bitcoin’s market dominance has broken below its year-long bullish trendline, which previously acted as a key support level. With a confirmed body close outside this trendline, the analyst suggests that Bitcoin’s dominance is likely to decline further. Adding to this narrative, liquidation data from the past 24 hours revealed $37.32 million in long liquidations and $34.20 million in short liquidations. This near-balance in liquidations highlights Bitcoin’s consolidation phase, as neither bullish nor bearish forces have managed to dominate the market. A pattern often seen during the lead-up to altseason. The cryptocurrency market cap hit an all-time high of $3.66 trillion, driven primarily by strong performance from altcoins. This surge occurred despite Bitcoin’s momentum slowing down, as market sentiment remained highly optimistic. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index reflected “extreme greed,” consistently staying above 80, signaling a strong appetite for risk among investors. What’s next Bitcoin? Most market experts on X predict Bitcoin’s price will dip to the mid-$80,000s in the coming weeks. However, the prevailing sentiment is that this is a natural correction on its journey toward $100,000. For instance, crypto commentator Byzantine General anticipates a deeper pullback in Bitcoin’s price, potentially dropping below $85,000 before staging a recovery. However, he stressed that it was a short-term correction but added that altcoins might also dip alongside BTC. Similarly, pseudonymous analyst CJ said he is eyeing the mid-$80,000 range as a key area of interest for Bitcoin. He sees this pullback as an opportunity for a bullish reversal in the short to mid-term, especially if Bitcoin reclaims key levels like $90,000 and holds above the 4-hour EMA 200, which he identified as a critical support for triggering long positions. Meanwhile, analyst Daan Crypto Trades highlighted that Bitcoin has entered a price discovery phase, a stage where significant gains have occurred in past cycles. He noted that Bitcoin surged 1,600% in 2017 and 245% in 2021 during similar phases, adding that even half of the 2021 rally could see prices reach $150,000 this time around. On a similar note, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Fund, explained that Bitcoin’s price discovery phase typically lasts 4–7 months and delivers substantial returns, and he expects “insane long opportunities” in the coming months. With Bitcoin consolidating, the altseason narrative has gained strength, with the Altcoin Season Index reaching 78—the highest since January. Typically, values above 75 indicate the market is in altseason. Several prominent projects posted notable gains on the day, with the leading performers being: XRP XRP (XRP) rallied 41.7% over the past day trading at $2.7 at press time while bringing its market cap to over $153.9 billion. The gains extended the altcoin’s monthly gains to over 430% while its daily trading volume jumped 321% hovering over $48.16 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap XRP’s recent rally followed the rumour that the Federal Reserve was considering XRP and XLM as potential systems to power the blockchain aspect of their FedNow payment system. Further, with SEC Chair Gary Gensler reportedly stepping down and a more crypto-friendly US. administration expected under Donald Trump in January 2025, rumors suggest the SEC may soon resolve its six-year lawsuit against Ripple, potentially boosting XRP. HBAR Hedera (HBAR) rose 42.9% over the last 24 hours, exchanging hands at a 10-month high of $0.279 before parting some of its gains and settling around $0.277 when writing. Its market cap was standing at $10.59 billion while its total trading volume over the past day was up 182%, at around $4.67 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap HBAR’s price rallied after it was selected to power the Federal Reserve’s payment system dubbed FedNow allowing real-time transactions in a more secure and efficient manner. Further rumours of Hedera integrating support for Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin have further fueled HBAR’s rally. The altcoin also gained amid ongoing speculation about the launch of an HBAR-focused exchange-traded fund, which could increase traditional investors’ exposure to the altcoin. Kaia Over the past day, Kaia (KAIA) gained 40.4% trading at its all-time high of $0.3371 per coin while its market cap surged past $1.9 billion at the time of publication. The price rally came along with a jump in KAIA’s trading volume which was up 255% hovering over $385.4 million. Source: CoinMarketCap KAIA’s recent price surge follows its integration with Avalon Labs’ USDa stablecoin, allowing users to earn yields of up to 15% while improving liquidity for the platform. The altcoin’s rally was also fueled by news of upcoming developments including a plan to roll out a mini dapp portal on the Japanese social media app Line that would enable its users to launch and enjoy web3 games on the platform.

37145965,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=621630,1733167216,"U.S. government transfers 19,000 Bitcoins worth $2 billion to Coinbase","The U.S. government has transferred 19,800 Bitcoins worth approximately $2 billion to Coinbase Prime. This stash, seized from the infamous Silk Road marketplace, was part of the government’s long-running effort to liquidate confiscated crypto assets. The funds, initially moved to a fresh wallet with zero transaction history, were later deposited to Coinbase Prime, the go-to platform for institutional crypto trading. Speculation is rife that this signals an impending sale. Historically, such government sales have triggered selloffs in the market. But Bitcoin prices have remained relatively stable this time, dipping to just over 1.6% to around $95,580 as of press time. Silk Road, James Zhong, and the massive Bitcoin haul Back in 2022, the Department of Justice (DOJ) seized over 50,000 bitcoins tied to the Silk Road marketplace. James Zhong, who orchestrated the heist in 2012, was arrested and later pleaded guilty to wire fraud. The DOJ accused Zhong of exploiting vulnerabilities in Silk Road’s transaction system to siphon off the assets. The seizure, valued at $3.36 billion at the time, is one of the largest crypto recoveries ever. Court filings show that the government sold a portion of these assets in March 2023, offloading 9,861 bitcoins for $216 million. The DOJ had planned to liquidate the remaining holdings in four tranches over the year, but updates on further sales have been scarce. Last month, a Northern California district court authorized the government to liquidate these assets while resolving a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request tied to the case. The government’s collaboration with Coinbase Prime is another part of this saga. Earlier this year, the U.S. Marshals Service, a DOJ division, partnered with Coinbase Prime to manage and trade confiscated digital assets. This partnership has likely streamlined the liquidation process, as Coinbase Prime specializes in handling large-scale institutional transactions. MicroStrategy keeps stacking But as the U.S. government liquidates, MicroStrategy continues to aggressively accumulate. The Virginia-based company, led by Bitcoin maxi Michael Saylor, added 15,400 bitcoins to its holdings just moments before America’s transfer. It spent $1.5 billion between November 25 and December 1. This brings MicroStrategy’s total stash to a staggering $38 billion. An SEC filing reveals that MicroStrategy has spent $13.5 billion on Bitcoin purchases since November 11 alone. Saylor’s strategy of turning the company into a “Bitcoin Treasury” has paid off, with the firm’s stock soaring over 500% this year. Unlike the government, which seems eager to cash out, MicroStrategy is doubling down, cementing its position as a top corporate Bitcoin whale.

Qubetics Sets the Stage for 58,213% Gains as Cronos Reports Profits and Bitcoin Cash Eyes $709","What makes a cryptocurrency truly worth your investment in 2024? Is it innovative technology, solid real-world applications, or simply the promise of massive returns? With so many digital assets competing for attention, it’s crucial to focus on projects that not only offer solutions to real-world problems but also have the potential to generate life-changing returns. While Cronos and Bitcoin Cash have recently shown promising developments in scalability and market growth, Qubetics ($TICS) is stepping up with a unique feature that could redefine asset management entirely. Its Real-World Asset Tokenization bridges traditional and blockchain economies, offering a transformative opportunity for investors and businesses alike. Let’s break down how these three cryptos are shaping up to be some of the best investments for 2024. Qubetics ($TICS) Pioneers Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is making waves as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional assets and blockchain technology. Its standout feature, Real-World Asset Tokenization , allows physical assets like real estate, art, and commodities to be represented digitally on the blockchain. This innovation provides liquidity to otherwise illiquid assets and opens up investment opportunities to a broader audience. Consider a small business owner with valuable equipment. Through Qubetics’ platform, they can tokenize this equipment, enabling them to secure loans using these tokens as collateral, thus accessing capital without traditional banking hurdles. For individual investors, this means the ability to invest in fractions of high-value assets like commercial real estate, diversifying their portfolios without substantial capital. Moreover, artists can tokenize their works, selling shares to multiple investors and receiving royalties automatically through smart contracts. This democratizes investment and ensures creators are fairly compensated. For a deeper understanding of Qubetics’ asset tokenization, check out this informative video . Qubetics Presale: A Golden Opportunity Currently, Qubetics is in its 11th presale stage, having sold over 255 million $TICS tokens to more than 5,600 holders, raising over $4.1 million. Tokens are priced at $0.0282 in this stage, with a 10% price increase slated for the next stage. Analysts predict that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering a 783% return on investment. Investment Example: Investing $68,000 at the current price of $0.0282 per token could yield: At $0.25 (end of presale): $531,205 (783% ROI) At $1 (post-presale): $2,400,000 (3434% ROI) At $5: $12,000,000 (17,571% ROI) At $15 (after mainnet launch): $36,000,000 (52,912% ROI). These projections showcase the significant potential for life-changing returns, making Qubetics an attractive choice for early investors. Cronos Expands Its Ecosystem Cronos, the native token of the Crypto.com ecosystem, has been actively expanding its reach. Recently, Cronos Group Inc. reported a profit of $8.3 million in its third quarter, translating to earnings of 2 cents per share citeturn0search10. This financial growth reflects the company’s efforts to enhance its platform and services. In addition, Cronos has been focusing on increasing its user base by offering various incentives and launching new products. These initiatives aim to strengthen its position in the competitive crypto market. Bitcoin Cash Shows Signs of a Strong Rally Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been experiencing significant price movements. The cryptocurrency recently rallied to near $500, gaining amid Bitcoin’s breakout performance citeturn0search1. Analysts suggest that if buying pressure continues and BCH surpasses the $500 hurdle, the next target could be $750. Furthermore, Bitcoin Cash has been breaking out of key technical patterns that suggest a 50% rally to $709 by December 2024 citeturn0search3. This bullish momentum is supported by Bitcoin’s halving events and pro-crypto policies. Conclusion: Seizing the Opportunity While Cronos and Bitcoin Cash are making strides in their respective areas, Qubetics ($TICS) offers a unique proposition with its real-world asset tokenization. The ongoing Qubetics presale presents a timely opportunity for investors to get in early and potentially reap substantial returns.

He noted that Since its launch, XRP has never caught the attention of whales to this extent. With XRP whale activity at an all-time high, this indicates that XRP has now been embraced as a valuable asset by whales. Notably, XRP has recently hit yet another multi-year high of $2.79. This rally pushed its market cap beyond $130 billion, which led to XRP outperform popular coins like Solana (SOL), BNB, and Dogecoin (DOGE). Remarkably, this bullish momentum has led XRP to unseat Tether as the third-largest crypto by market cap, with XRP currently sitting at a market cap of $154 billion compared to Tether’s $134 billion. Rally Driven By Whales! Crypto analysts suggest that XRP’s recent rally was largely driven by whale activity, triggering a fear of missing out among retail investors. In a latest X post, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju noted that whale activity on Coinbase played a significant role. Coinbase whales are driving this $XRP rally. Over the past 30 days, Coinbase's minute-level price premium has ranged from 3% to 13% during the surge. Meanwhile, Upbit—a Korean exchange with more XRP investors than Binance—has shown no significant premium so far. pic.twitter.com/ENESB2Zrkv — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 2, 2024 He noted that “Coinbase whales are driving this XRP rally.

Sentiment data also highlights significant involvement from retail investors. The total number of XRP wallets has reached an all-time high of 5.5 million, indicating that many previously inactive wallets are now holding balances. RLUSD Around The Corner? According to Fox Business , Ripple is preparing for a potential launch as early as Dec. 4. If this happens, it will be crucial for Ripple as it would position RLUSD as a direct competitor to established stablecoins like USDC and USDT. RLUSD would enable Ripple to provide a stable alternative for users seeking the benefits of digital assets without the price volatility associated with XRP or other cryptocurrencies. Analysts Bullish on XRP While XRP is currently sitting at $2.68, it still trades about 30% below its all-time high of $3.84, achieved in January 2018. Notable crypto analyst Dark Defender has identified a Fibonacci-based target of $5.85, marking it as a key level. He noted that XRP has consistently met critical milestones, including its recent surge past $1.88, and highlights support levels at $1.88 and $2.13 as potential safety nets. His roadmap even charts a long-term target of $18.22, which is bold prediction. Raoul aul, the CEO of Real Vision, also shared XRP’s ‘good-looking chart’ and believes that it has a lot of potential to go up. You've got to admit, $XRP is a good looking chart.

This is clearly indicative of the increasing utilization of cryptocurrencies by institutions as a proper diversification tool and for generating value over the long haul. MARA Holdings Wants to Fortify Bitcoin Portfolio The new funding is meant to place MARA Holdings in the top ranks in cryptocurrency investment. This corporate plan to grow Bitcoin holdings falls within the wider trend currently experienced across industries, where digital assets become integral parts of institutional investment portfolios. Bitcoin, being the most recognized cryptocurrency, serves as a hedge to economic uncertainty and hence continues to entice corporations. This announcement comes after a record month in November, where Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. raked in $6.4 billion in inflows. Institutional demand, together with retail interest, has propelled Bitcoin prices to new highs, further vindicating the decision by MARA Holdings to deepen its stake. Debt Repayment and Strategic Focus Apart from the acquisition of cryptocurrency , MARA Holdings is contemplating debt repayment with part of the funds raised. This balanced approach thus shows the firm’s concern for financial health while going aggressively for growth in the digital asset market. According to analysts, this could be a signal of the company’s long-term vision and operational discipline. Ripple Labs and Crypto Market Trends The move also comes when Ripple Labs is making aggressive expansion efforts, including the expected launch of RLUSD, an overcollateralized stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. The continuous court cases of Ripple with the SEC and new product launches could affect broader market dynamics and make it a good time for crypto adoption. Moreover, Ripple’s active role in developing diverse blockchain-based products reflects a market-wide push toward innovation. This evolution enhances the appeal of digital assets among institutional and retail investors alike. Market Trends and Industry Outlook November was a milestone month for Bitcoin ETF inflows, propelled by bullish sentiment and rocketing prices. Bitcoin rallied 45% last month to an all-time high of $99,000, reflecting strong investor confidence in the cryptocurrency. MARA Holdings increased its focus on Bitcoin acquisition at a time when the asset class is showing such strong momentum and positioning itself as a key institutional player. By balancing aggressive asset acquisition with prudent debt management , MARA Holdings shows a good fit with changing dynamics in cryptocurrency markets. Its strategic actions not only strengthen its financial position but also underpin the growing role of institutional entities in shaping the future of digital assets. All of this reflects a thoughtful balance between embracing innovation and stability, further cementing MARA Holdings’ influential position in the cryptocurrency space.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/mara-holdings-to-raise-805m-for-bitcoin-purchases/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

Plans Failed? China Analyst Responds,"The long-awaited idea of a major economic stimulus from China has been refuted, according to Shehzad Qazi, Chief Operating Officer of China Beige Book. Speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box, Qazi shared his views on China's economic trajectory, the effects of former US President Donald Trump's tariff threats and Beijing's cautious fiscal approach, as outlined in the firm's November report. The China Beige Book report shows year-over-year growth in revenue and profits for factories, particularly those that benefited from a preemptive surge in export orders ahead of potential U.S. tariffs. “Export orders have risen to levels not seen since COVID as companies fear tariffs and bring forward their purchases,” Qazi said. But the increase reflects strategic adjustments rather than sustained growth. Related News: JPMorgan Releases New Report on Bitcoin Network Following Recent Volatility Despite the rise in certain economic indicators, Qazi dismissed speculation about significant government stimulus. “The idea of a big Chinese stimulus has been proven completely wrong,” he said, explaining that Beijing appeared to be saving its financial tools for future economic stability rather than launching large-scale intervention now. The report also examined the complex US-China trade dynamics under the Trump administration. While Trump’s tariff threats have created uncertainty, they have also encouraged a surge in Chinese factories. “They are probably pulling back on their firepower to stabilize the economy next year as the tariff threats become more tangible,” Qazi said of Beijing’s response to the new US administration. Qazi also addressed the narrative that China prefers Trump over Biden. Arguing that the Chinese leadership values the predictability of stable policies, Qazi suggested that they may find Biden’s administration easier to manage than Trump’s high-risk, transactional approach. *This is not investment advice.

Bloomberg reported this funding as a significant development in the AI industry. Founder and semiconductor pioneer Jim Keller said in an interview that the feat was achieved in a funding round led by South Korea’s AFW Partners and Samsung Securities, aimed at raising capital for Tenstorrent. The AI startup hopes to create a chip to try to break Nvidia’s stranglehold on the AI business. Tenstorrent and other smaller firms are emerging, pressuring Nvidia Bezos Expeditions joined LG Electronics and Fidelity in that financing, betting on Keller ’s pedigree and the booming opportunity in AI tech. The AI startup will use the funding to expand its engineering team, invest in its global supply chain, and build large AI training servers to help demonstrate its technology. This comes as smaller companies are sprouting up trying to snatch market share from Nvidia’s power-hungry chip. The startups are coming in with the gospel of more power and cost efficiency in AI technology. Tenstorrent is one of these new startups. As part of these new startups, Tenstorrent is Nvidia’s neighbor in Santa Clara, California, and is one of the many engineering solutions now aimed at delivering a more affordable path to AI development. Nvidia favors complex and pricey components like high bandwidth memory, but Tenstorrent is built on open-source and commonplace technology which avoids the Nvidia route. “You cannot beat Nvidia if you use HBM, because Nvidia buys the most HBM and has a cost advantage,” Keller said. “But they will never be able to bring the price down the way HBM is built into their products and their sockets,” added Keller. In order to give customers value for money, Nvidia promises that all parts work better because they were designed in concert. As a result, the chipmaker offers developers a full suite of proprietary technology covering everything from the chips to interconnects and even data center layouts. Nvidia’s rivals like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and startup Tenstorrent are looking to give developers chips with greater interoperability with other technology providers, whether through shared industry standards or opening their designs for others to use. Based on an open standard called RISC-V, Tenstorrent is a proponent of the alternative kind of logic processor. The technology poses a significant challenge to Arm Holdings, and Jim Keller—renowned for his silicon design contributions at Apple, AMD, and Tesla—is a strong advocate for its adoption. “Open source helps you build a bigger platform. It attracts engineers, and yes, it’s a little bit of a passion project.” – Keller “In the past, I worked with proprietary technology and it was really tough,” added Keller. Keller’s approach differs from Nvidia’s strategy of providing a vertically integrated solution from chip to data center design. Tenstorrent to release new AI processor Tenstorrent like its peers, RISC-V and Japanese partners Rapdius Corp, still has much to do to prove themselves. With the competition rife, Nvidia has tens of billions of dollars of data center revenue each quarter, whilst Tenstorrent to date, the nascent company has signed contracts with customers totaling nearly $150 million. Keller also revealed that Tenstorrent aims to release a new AI processor every two years whilst Nvidia on the other hand, aims to refresh its AI chip offerings on an annual cycle according to its boss Jensen Haung’s statement in June. Managing director Bonil Koo said AFW Partners invested after hearing positive feedback from Korean companies already collaborating with Tenstorrent such as LG. Export Development Canada, Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan, Hyundai Motor Group, and Baille Gifford were the other investors in this funding round. Tenstorrent said Samsung Electronics and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) will make the next round of funding after GlobalFoundries made the first iteration. The startup has begun designing for cutting-edge 2-nanometer fabrication.

If achieved, this surge could see it surpass well-known cryptocurrencies like Solana and Avalanche. The article explores the factors that might propel this token to the forefront of the crypto market. CYBRO Presale Climbs Past $5.5 Million: A One-in-a-Million DeFi Investment Opportunity CYBRO is capturing the attention of crypto whales as its exclusive token presale quickly surges above $5.5 million. This cutting-edge multichain DeFi platform offers investors unparalleled opportunities to maximize their earnings across various blockchains in any market condition. The presale is currently in its 8th stage out of 10, marking the final chance for investors to buy CYBRO tokens at the presale price of just $0.045 each. With only two stages remaining, the window of opportunity is closing quickly. The Token Generation Event (TGE) is just around the corner, and prices are expected to skyrocket, with experts forecasting a potential ROI of 1200%. Holders of CYBRO tokens will enjoy lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, cashback on purchases, reduced trading and lending fees, and a robust insurance program within the platform. With only 21% of the total tokens available for this presale and approximately 100 million already sold, this is a golden opportunity for savvy investors to secure a stake in a project that's truly one in a million. >>>Join CYBRO and aim for future returns up to 1200% Solana's Scalable Blockchain: Discovering SOL's Role in Dapps Development Solana is a blockchain platform that focuses on scalability. It provides a base for decentralized applications, known as dapps. Competing with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana aims for faster transactions through its unique architecture. It supports development in multiple programming languages, making it flexible for developers. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of Solana. It is essential to the ecosystem. SOL is used for transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding those who support the network. The coin holds value as it powers the Solana ecosystem and gives users access to various projects. Solana does not use sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. Instead, it attracts developers and investors with its high-capacity network. Avalanche (AVAX): A Layer-1 Blockchain Offering Speed and Customization Avalanche (AVAX) is a Layer-1 blockchain platform that provides eco-friendly operations, low transaction fees, and high-speed processing with a capacity of 4,500 transactions per second. It enables users to launch customizable Subnets for tailored blockchain deployments. Avalanche employs a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines classical and Nakamoto consensus principles, achieving transaction finality in less than two seconds. The platform consists of three interoperable chains—the X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—that manage various functions like transactions and smart contract executions. AVAX, the native token of Avalanche, plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by covering transaction fees, securing the network through staking, and facilitating the operation of multiple Subnets, supporting payments, staking, and the creation of custom tokens and blockchains. Conclusion In the current bullish market of 2024, CYBRO emerges as a standout in the DeFi space. While established coins like Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) show less potential in the short term, CYBRO offers investors unmatched opportunities for maximized earnings. Its AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain sets it apart from competitors. With features like lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO provides a superior user experience. Seamless deposits and withdrawals enhance its appeal. Emphasizing transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO has attracted strong interest from crypto whales and influencers. These factors position it as a promising project with the potential to surpass its rivals by 2025.

37147436,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315381,1733165690,"Best Crypto to Buy Now December 2 – HBAR, KAIA, IOTA","The Bitcoin (BTC) market has started the first proper trading day of December on the back foot amid fears the US government might be about to dump tokens, though Bitcoin remains a strong candidate for best crypto to buy now. That’s because, in every December that followed a positive November since 2015, Bitcoin has always gone on to post a double-digit monthly percentage gain. While a supply dump from the US government may have dampened sentiment so far this month, risks remain titled towards a breakout above $100,000 before the year’s end. The U.S. government sits on $18+ Billion in Bitcoin from. They just moved $1.9 Billion to an exchange (likely trying to sell it).

Maybe Biden tries to sell Before Trump comes to offices? pic.twitter.com/56kg22T5Dn — Gabor Gurbacs (@gaborgurbacs) December 2, 2024 That’s because the incoming Trump administration and Republican-controlled Congress is expected to usher in a new golden age of pro-crypto policy in the USA, which could potentially include the establishment of a national bitcoin reserve. Its no surprise that institutional investors piled into Bitcoin ETFs at a record rate in November. JUST IN: #BitcoinETFs attracted a staggering $6.4B in inflows this November, as $BTC soared 45% to hit an ATH of $99K. #Bitcoin #CryptoMomentum pic.twitter.com/0vNfCBUPfj — DeFi Planet (@PlanetDefi) December 2, 2024 For investors new to the crypto space, Bitcoin is a strong candidate for best crypto to buy now. But for more experienced crypto investors, altcoins may offer a better risk reward. After all, the unfriendly policy stance of the Biden administration and government agencies over the past few years hurt altcoins the most, so a shift to a pro-crypto policy stance means they have the most to gain. The market cap of the altcoin marke t minus Bitcoin and Ethereum was up a staggering 60% in November, with XRP (XRP) a notable leader. Indeed, XRP’s rally has continued into December, with the crypto up another 40% in the past 24 hours to a price around $2.70. That means XRP is up a staggering 430% in the past 30 days, reaching a market cap of more than $150 billion, ranking it as the third largest crypto behind only BTC and ETH. However, many might feel they have missed out on the XRP move, and that it isn’t the best crypto to buy now. Here are some other strong-performing altcoins that may offer more near-term upside potential. Best Crypto to Buy Now – Which Are They? Hedera (HBAR) Data-focused blockchain Hedera (HBAR) is up a stunning 50% in the past 24 hours per CoinMarketCap . Last at $0.29, it is up around 7x from its November lows. However, it is yet to test its 2021 highs in the $0.57 area. A further 2x gain to this area is likely in the weeks ahead followed by potential explosive price discovery. That’s why HBAR could be the best crypto to buy now for those looking for a highly volatile coin. Kaia (KAIA) Asia-focused layer-1 blockchain protocol Kaia (KAIA) is another strong performer, surging a stunning 45% in the past 24 hours on Monday per CoinMarketCap . The relatively new crypto was last trading around $0.3650, giving it a market cap of just over $2 billion. But if it really does gain traction in the Asia market, it could easily become a $10 billion market cap coin, suggesting 5x gains are in the offing, suggesting its a candidate for best crypto to buy now. IOTA (IOTA) Internet of Things-focused blockchain IOTA (IOTA) is another altcoin on the front foot, gaining 28% in the past 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap . Last at $0.38, IOTA is coming close to retesting its 2024 highs. But the market’s unstoppable momentum suggests a breakout is likely, and many investors will be eyeing a 5x rally back to 2021 highs above $2.0. As this altcoin season heats up, IOTA could be one of the best cryptos to buy now. That said, some highly risk-tolerant crypto investors looking for even larger upside potential may prefer to invest in meme coins. One of the best ways to secure 20x or greater gains in the meme coin space is by getting into a new meme coin before it really starts to trend. And one of the best ways to do this is to get involved in meme coin presales. Analysts at crypto news.com keep a close eye on the meme coin presale market for high-potential projects. Here are some of their top picks right now. 19 Best New Meme Coins to Buy in December 2024 The post Best Crypto to Buy Now December 2 – HBAR, KAIA, IOTA appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEUTRAL,BTC | HBAR | IOTA,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | HBAR | IOTA,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-december-2-hbar-kaia-iota/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37147436.jpeg

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE.

Created by Satoshi Nakamoto, it operates as a distributed ledger across network nodes, eliminating the need for intermediaries like banks. Transactions are verified through mining, where miners solve complex puzzles and are rewarded with bitcoins. With a capped supply of 21 million bitcoins, the network undergoes a ""halving"" every four years, reducing miners' rewards by half. This system aims to be resilient against fraud, offering a new way to transact securely and transparently. Bitcoin's technology has paved the way for many other cryptocurrencies and applications, marking a significant shift in how we handle money and digital assets. Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Powers DeFi and dApps Ethereum is a blockchain that uses Proof-of-Stake. It is known for its smart contracts and apps called dApps. Many use it for decentralized finance. To make transactions faster, it uses Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon. Ethereum introduced ERC-20 tokens used for governance, utility, and storing value. But you still need ETH to pay gas fees. The move to Proof-of-Stake aims to make it more scalable and cost-effective. Ethereum focuses on decentralization and efficiency. Ether (ETH) is vital to the system. It helps in transactions, rewards stakers, and can be traded or used as collateral. Conclusion While established cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH offer stability, they may have less potential for rapid short-term growth. In contrast, CYBRO presents a unique opportunity for investors to significantly increase their earnings by 2025. As a cutting-edge DeFi platform utilizing AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain, CYBRO provides attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. Its seamless deposit and withdrawal process enhances user experience. With a strong emphasis on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO has captured the attention of major crypto investors and influencers. Investing as little as $300 in CYBRO today could pave the way to building a substantial portfolio in the emerging bull run.

Supreme Court Rulings and Federal Oversight Ramaswamy pointed to two key judicial developments as the foundation for reducing federal regulatory power. The Supreme Court’s rejection of “Chevron deference,” a principle that allowed federal agencies to interpret ambiguous statutes, and the Major Questions Doctrine, which requires agencies to act only with clear legal authority, were described as transformative. The Supreme Court this year overturned “Chevron deference” in its Loper Bright ruling, which deals a seismic blow to federal bureaucracy. Under the old standard, federal courts deferred to agency interpretations of law when a statute was deemed ambiguous. That’s no longer the… — Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) December 2, 2024 “Overturning Chevron deference, combined with the Major Questions Doctrine codified in West Virginia vs EPA, paves the way for not a slight but a drastic reduction in the scope of the federal regulatory state,” Ramaswamy wrote in his post. “It’s coming.” The court decisions, finalized in 2024 and 2022 respectively, restrict federal agencies’ ability to interpret statutes. These changes are expected to impact numerous industries, including cryptocurrency , which has long been subject to what critics describe as a heavy-handed regulatory approach. Implications for the Cryptocurrency Sector The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , a frequent target of criticism for its enforcement-focused regulation, has faced scrutiny under these evolving legal standards. President-elect Trump previously addressed the cryptocurrency community, promising a shift toward regulations designed by “the people who love your industry, not hate your industry.” Former SEC chair Gary Gensler, who resigned last month , was often criticized for policies that stifled innovation within the blockchain industry. @GaryGensler to step down as @SECGov Chair in January 2025, concluding a term of bold enforcement actions in the crypto space. #CryptoRegulations #GaryGensler #SEC https://t.co/iKmVa3QkSM — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 21, 2024 Trump’s administration, bolstered by DOGE’s mission, seeks to realign regulatory efforts to foster growth and efficiency. DOGE’s Role in Reshaping Federal Bureaucracy The Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE), led by Vivek Ramaswamy and tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, has been tasked with streamlining federal oversight and eliminating unnecessary bureaucratic layers. In a November statement, President-elect Trump outlined the department’s objectives, stating, “Elon and Vivek will dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies.” The initiative seeks to enhance government efficiency while addressing longstanding criticisms of regulatory overreach. Progressive voices have also weighed in on DOGE’s mission. Senator Bernie Sanders, in a December 2 X post , expressed agreement with some of Musk’s critiques of federal inefficiency, calling him “right” about the need for reform. Elon Musk is right. The Pentagon, with a budget of $886 billion, just failed its 7th audit in a row. It’s lost track of billions. Last year, only 13 senators voted against the Military Industrial Complex and a defense budget full of waste and fraud. That must change. — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) December 1, 2024 As the Trump administration prepares to take office, many stakeholders are awaiting specifics on the regulations DOGE intends to address. The department’s actions are anticipated to bring major changes to the federal regulatory framework, with potential implications across various industries, including cryptocurrency.

XRP hit a price of $2.81 early on Monday and has since retraced slightly to $2.68, giving it 424% gains in the last 30 days. At time of writing, XRP has a market cap of $152.5 billion and a fully diluted valuation of $257.4 billion, making it the third-largest crypto asset. Last week, reports surfaced from Fox News’ Eleanor Terret that global exchange-traded fund (ETF) giant WisdomTree had filed for a spot XRP ETF product in the state of Delaware. Now, official filings with the SEC for the product have been released for WisdomTree’s “WisdomTree XRP fund,” which aims to give investors exposure to XRP through issuing shares of the fund on the Cboe BZX Exchange. The filing names Coinbase, the biggest crypto exchange in the US as the fund’s custodian. “Coinbase serves as the XRP custodian and prime execution agent for several competing exchange-traded XRP products, which could adversely affect the Trust’s operations and ultimately the value of the Shares.” Earlier in November, asset manager 21Shares also filed a Form S-1 registration statement with the SEC for a proposed product called “the 21Shares Core XRP Trust.” The trust aims to be a passive investment vehicle that tracks the price of XRP. XRP hit an all-time high of $3.40 in January of 2018.

Chaofan Shou, co-founder of security firm Fuzzland, initially attributed the exploit to a private key leak, allowing the attacker to authorize deposit and withdrawal transactions. Clipper, however, has refuted this explanation, stating that its security model is specifically designed to safeguard against such issues. The Exploit According to the latest update by Clipper, the attack resulted in the loss of approximately $450,000, representing around 6% of its total value locked (TVL). While the attacker tried to exploit other chains, these attempts were unsuccessful, leaving them and the pools unaffected. The exploit has since been mitigated, and Clipper assured that it has taken immediate action to safeguard user funds and investigate the breach. All swaps and deposits across chains have been paused temporarily as a precautionary measure. However, withdrawals remain fully functional, consistent with Clipper’s noncustodial nature, which ensures users retain control over their assets. It is important to note that withdrawals must currently include a mix of all assets in the pool, as the ability to withdraw a single token – identified as the exploited feature – has been disabled. Addressing speculation regarding the nature of the incident, Clipper clarified that the exploit was not caused by a private key leak. The team behind the DEX is actively collaborating with security experts to investigate the breach and implement enhanced safeguards thoroughly. “In addition to the investigation, an effort has begun to trace funds to attempt recovery. If you are the exploiter and are willing to speak, please reach out directly. Clipper is committed to transparency and will provide further updates to the community as more information becomes available.” Hacks Ravage DeFi According to Immunefi’s November 2024 report , hacks were responsible for an astounding 99.96% of all crypto losses that month. Meanwhile, fraud and rug pulls significantly declined, accounting for just $25,300 across two incidents. The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector bore the brunt, suffering $71 million in losses – marking the second-lowest monthly total of the year and a sharp drop from $343 million in November 2023.

37144194,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656295,1733164258,XRP Reaches 6-Year High – Whales And STH Accumulate Together,"XRP has soared to a remarkable $2.49, marking its highest market value since January 8, 2018. This impressive milestone follows an astounding 395% price surge since November 5, reflecting renewed investor enthusiasm and strong market momentum. The rapid rally has reignited discussions about XRP’s potential as one of the standout performers in the crypto market. Key data from blockchain analytics firm Santiment highlights a significant accumulation trend among large holders. In three weeks, wallets holding 1M-10M XRP have amassed 679.1 million tokens—equivalent to $1.66 billion. This aggressive accumulation underscores increasing confidence in XRP’s prospects, particularly as the broader market exhibits bullish sentiment. Analysts suggest the coming weeks could bring further upside for XRP and the overall crypto market, driven by heightened interest and strong demand. As XRP tests these new highs, the focus will shift to whether it can sustain this momentum and break through psychological resistance levels. With market dynamics favoring a bullish outlook, XRP’s performance could set the tone for altcoins entering the next phase of this market cycle. Investors now keenly observe XRP’s trajectory as it navigates this critical juncture. XRP Extends Record-Breaking Rally XRP’s remarkable uptrend shows no signs of slowing, with the asset surging 30% in under 24 hours, breaking decisively above the $2 mark. Following a brief consolidation below $2, this rally has pushed XRP to an impressive $2.49—a level unseen since January 8, 2018. Recent blockchain data from Santiment reveals the underlying strength driving this surge. Key accumulation trends show wallets holding 1M-10M XRP have collectively added 679.1 million tokens to their holdings in just three weeks. This translates to a staggering $1.66 billion, signaling renewed confidence among large holders. Additionally, XRP’s total non-empty wallets have reached a historic milestone, surpassing 5.5 million for the first time in the cryptocurrency’s 8+ year history. The convergence of these bullish metrics confirms that demand for XRP is intensifying, fueling its record-breaking rally. Analysts and investors are watching closely, noting that the continued expansion in wallet activity and accumulation patterns strongly supports XRP’s upward momentum. As XRP capitalizes on these bullish trends, its ability to sustain and build on this momentum will be crucial. If accumulation and wallet growth persist at this pace, XRP could redefine its position in the crypto market, setting new benchmarks for its next leg up. XRP Price Holds At $2.30 XRP is trading at $2.30, consolidating after a remarkable rally that saw it touch $2.50, nearing its all-time high. This marks an extraordinary performance, with XRP achieving significant gains over the past month as it revisits price levels last seen in 2018. The bullish momentum remains intact, and traders closely monitor the $2.30 level as a key support. If XRP holds above this level in the coming hours, a breakout past $2.50 seems increasingly likely, setting the stage for the asset to test even higher resistance levels. However, failure to maintain the $2.30 support could lead to a short-term pullback, with the price likely finding demand at $2.08. This critical level could provide a foundation for further consolidation before XRP attempts another push upward. As market participants continue to watch XRP’s price action, its ability to sustain these levels will determine the trajectory of its next move. With bullish sentiment still driving demand, the coming hours are crucial for XRP’s bid to solidify its position above $2.30 and aim for new milestones beyond $2.50.

As 2025 nears, attention shifts to cryptocurrencies that demonstrate resilience and potential for substantial growth in a fluctuating market. However, the focus isn't merely on following trends. It's about selecting assets with solid fundamentals and practical uses that contribute to lasting achievements—cryptocurrencies like BlockDAG, Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, and Polkadot, which are recommended as the top buys for considerable gains in 2025. The possibilities are genuine, and 2025 might be a transformative year for those who choose their cryptocurrencies wisely. Let’s examine these top cryptocurrencies to understand their potential impact. 1. BlockDAG: Cutting-Edge Technology, Robust Momentum Top on our list is BlockDAG (BDAG) , noted for its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure. This advanced configuration allows for numerous concurrent transactions, improving scalability and lowering costs. BlockDAG's strategy addresses the typical challenges faced by conventional blockchain technology. BlockDAG’s initial offering raised over $153 million, yielding a 2240% return for early contributors. Daily significant transactions of $5 million indicate robust market interest. BlockDAG has also reached crucial milestones, such as a successful testnet launch and an ongoing mainnet review, underscoring its commitment to security and functionality. In addition, BlockDAG’s growing network and its increasing use by miners—with over 200,000 users actively on its X1 Miner app—highlight its potential to lead in the cryptocurrency market. Crypto analysts suggest that with continued momentum, BDAG could reach $30 by 2030. With its pioneering approach and expanding community, BlockDAG is recognized as one of the top cryptocurrencies to purchase in 2025. 2. Solana: Swift, Expansive & Dependable Solana stands out in blockchain efficiency with its rapid processing speeds and affordable costs. It employs a distinctive Proof of History (PoH) mechanism that scales smoothly while keeping the network decentralized. Its dedication to innovation makes it a preferred platform for projects aiming for speed and dependability. Solana's decentralized exchanges (DEXs) see a daily trade volume surpassing $6 billion, holding 45% of the market share. Its ecosystem is on the rise, as developers utilize its capabilities to advance blockchain technology. Analysts highlight a recent price uptick of 2.60% in Solana, now trading at $261. While optimism is high, forthcoming resistance levels could shape its future performance. 3. Cardano: Prioritizing Sustainability and Expansion Next is Cardano, recognized for its commitment to sustainable and effective blockchain applications. Its dual-layer design separates transaction and operation layers, boosting both security and scalability. Cardano aids significant initiatives, such as land registries and decentralized identity systems, especially in emerging markets. In the last month, Cardano’s price has risen over 40%, with increasing interest suggesting a surge in market engagement. Talks of a potential spot ETF by 2025 further fuel the positive outlook. These elements make Cardano a top cryptocurrency to consider in 2025. 4. Avalanche: Adaptable with Cross-Chain Growth Avalanche ranks fourth in top cryptocurrencies to invest in for 2025. It emphasizes seamless compatibility across multiple blockchains. Its cutting-edge consensus model delivers almost immediate transaction finality and high transaction capacity, ideal for DeFi applications and business solutions. AVAX has climbed about 75% in the past month, including a 25% increase last week. A recent Golden Cross pattern in its EMA 50/200-day chart suggests a potential for more upward movement. With a current price of $45.08, AVAX demonstrates steadiness in a fluctuating market. 5. Polkadot: Enhanced Interoperability and Expansion Completing our lineup is Polkadot, tailored for efficient integration across different blockchains. Its unique parachain system enhances both scalability and adaptability, ideal for projects that operate across multiple chains. In the last month, DOT has soared by 122%, pushing past significant resistance points and stabilizing above $8. It’s currently valued at $8.58, with upcoming resistance levels at $9.31 and $10. Polkadot continues to develop its network and robust structure, making it a strong candidate for acquisition in 2025. Best Cryptos to Buy in 2025: Which One to Choose? Looking towards 2025, cryptocurrencies like Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, and Polkadot demonstrate robust growth and potential. Solana is noted for its swift transactions and expansive capabilities, Cardano for its sustainable practices and tangible applications, Avalanche for its interoperability across blockchains, and Polkadot for its efficient cross-chain communication. These features position them as formidable options for the upcoming year. While all present significant growth prospects through their vibrant ecosystems and innovative attributes, BlockDAG distinguishes itself as a leading choice for 2025. With its forward-thinking presale coin design and widening user base, BlockDAG is highlighted as a prime contender in the crypto market. Analysts forecast that BDAG could reach $30 by 2030 if its current upward trend persists, signaling a prime moment for those looking to embrace long-term advancements in the crypto arena.

37144805,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=621573,1733164065,Trump risks ruining his friendship with Putin after threats against de-dollarization,"Donald Trump might have just struck a nerve with his ‘buddy,’ the Russian president Vladimir Putin and the entire BRICS coalition. As we reported over the weekend, the US president lashed out at the bloc, warning them against creating a new currency to challenge their dollar. Trump threatened 100% tariffs on all of them if they dared replace the greenback. With the BRICS pushing de-dollarization harder than ever, Trump’s ultimatum may create a fracture in his complex relationship with Putin, who has actually cautioned him against it. Trump’s threats shake global markets BRICS nations control over 40% of the world’s central-bank reserves and have floated the idea of a unified currency for trade. While economists like Mark Sobel, a former US Treasury official, dismiss the idea as “hot air,” others believe Trump’s rhetoric could accelerate these efforts. “The dollar remains dominant for several reasons: it’s the most liquid currency, trades freely, and is the world’s lending currency,” said Rodrigo Catril of National Australia Bank in Sydney. But he also warned that Trump’s heavy-handed tactics might push BRICS countries to move faster on reducing reliance on the greenback. Right now, the dollar dominates 88% of all daily foreign exchange trades. Still, cracks are forming. Brazil and China already trade in their own currencies, while India and Malaysia have signed agreements to boost rupee transactions. Even Thailand and China have inked deals for local currency swaps. Trump’s threats may force more such agreements into reality. The Putin factor: A diplomatic gamble Trump’s tough talk risks complicating his carefully cultivated relationship with Putin. For years, Trump has publicly praised the Russian president, even calling him a “genius” at one point. But this admiration masks a transactional relationship. Both leaders have used their rapport to advance their own agendas, from Syria to Ukraine. But with sanctions biting and global trade shifting, Putin has long sought to weaken US financial hegemony. Though he did express a desire to abandon his de-dollarization plans for Trump, so the president-elect’s latest remarks were quite literally needless. He is testing the limits of their so-called friendship. Trump’s push to maintain dollar dominance is nothing new. During his first term, he weaponized tariffs as a bargaining tool, from China to Europe. But this time, he’s targeting an entire bloc of nations that collectively make up a significant portion of the global economy. This dominance is backed by the unparalleled size of the US economy and the trustworthiness of its Treasury bonds. Even during crises, the greenback remains the ultimate safe haven. But analysts warn that the more the US flexes its financial muscle, the more other nations might seek alternatives. The long road to de-dollarization For all the noise, creating a new BRICS currency is easier said than done. The logistics are daunting. A single currency would require coordination across vastly different economies, with varying levels of development and governance. Russia, under Putin, has been particularly aggressive. Facing what he believes to be unfair Western sanctions by Biden and NATO, as well as a declining ruble, Moscow embraced de-dollarization as a survival strategy. One that Putin thought he didn’t need anymore. Trump’s love for tariffs is no secret. From steel to soybeans, he’s used them as both carrot and stick throughout his political career. His latest 100% tariff threat against BRICS nations fits the pattern, but the implications are far-reaching. For one, tariffs could hurt American businesses and consumers, as costs get passed down the supply chain. They could also deepen rifts with allies and trading partners, making it harder for the US to rally support against China or Russia. How Trump gets through this delicate situation could define not only his presidency but also the future of US relations. Will his friendship with Putin survive this latest clash? Or will economic nationalism drive a wedge between them? The world is watching.

He mentioned he would not mind receiving a pardon from former U.S. President Donald Trump. CZ made these comments in response to a post on X by John Lilic, Executive Director of the Telos Foundation. Lilic’s post led to strong support from the online community. In his reply, CZ thanked everyone for their support but said he did not want to return as the CEO of Binance. However, his mention of Trump sparked speculation about whether a pardon could help him resolve his legal issues. Meanwhile, some individuals on X hope that CZ will return to Binance, while others think he could help the crypto industry by working in government or making policies. They believe his knowledge of blockchain and financial technology could lead to better regulations and greater trust in the industry. Changpeng Zhao Sentencing Saga CZ’s sentence came after he pled guilty in November 2023 for failing to implement anti-money laundering protocols at Binance. He faced a four-month prison term and a $50 million personal fine. However, the consequences extended beyond CZ. The cryptocurrency exchange agreed to pay $4.3 million , marking one of the largest settlements in history. The decision sparked mixed reactions within the crypto community, leaving many questioning the implications for the exchange’s future. When asked about the fairness of his sentence, CZ was cautious. He acknowledged that his plea deal prevented him from criticizing the ruling. He also noted that he was fortunate compared to others facing longer sentences. Changpeng Zhao on Embracing Fresh Starts Discussing his relationship with Binance, CZ confirmed he cannot engage in day-to-day operations but remains optimistic about his shareholders’ rights. He admitted that his first month back from prison was a bit difficult, emotional even. He revealed his profound connection with the business he built from the ground up. Meanwhile, CZ plans to invest his time in initiatives like Giggle Academy and provides educational access to undeserved communities. His commitment to the project reflects a growing interest in philanthropy as he transitions from the crypto-focused work that has dominated his career so far. Likewise, he voiced unwavering confidence in digital assets’ future, affirming that, in the long term, he will remain extremely bullish on crypto.

Among these, Dogecoin (DOGE), PEPE Coin (PEPE), Floki (FLOKI), and BlockDAG (BDAG) are becoming particularly noteworthy. Each of these projects showcases unique attributes, from cutting-edge technology to expanding networks, attracting those keen on harnessing their growth potential. Let’s delve into their current performance and explore what lies ahead. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Spearheading Blockchain Innovation BlockDAG (BDAG) is revolutionizing blockchain with its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, which offers superior scalability, security, and decentralization. This modern architecture provides quick transactions and consistent network expansion, even during high traffic times. Supported by a solid Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, BlockDAG upholds the highest standards of network security and reliability, making it a standout in Layer-1 blockchain technologies. Furthermore, BlockDAG's presale results have been remarkable, with $155 million raised and over 16.7 billion BDAG coins sold, demonstrating a strong market presence. Those who engaged early have seen their holdings surge by an impressive 2240%, as the price per BDAG coin rose from $0.001 to $0.0234 in the latest release. Additionally, BlockDAG's $1 million giveaway provides an exciting chance for 50 participants to win $20,000 each. Participants need to maintain $100 worth of BDAG coins to enter. With only 22 days remaining, this initiative boosts community interaction and further increases demand for BDAG, affirming its status among the top altcoins available today. 2. Dogecoin (DOGE): Streamlining Digital Transactions Dogecoin emerged in 2013 as a humorous twist on Bitcoin and has since maintained a prominent position in the meme coin arena. Originating from the Shiba Inu meme, it quickly became popular for micro-tipping, charitable donations, and commercial transactions. Dogecoin's sustained market presence benefits from a devoted following and sporadic endorsements by celebrities. Its development may progress at a different pace compared to other cryptocurrencies, but it is frequently noted for its straightforward and user-friendly approach. The ongoing dialogue about its suitability for decentralized financial exchanges continues to draw attention. 3. PEPE: Embracing the Famous Frog Meme PEPE, inspired by the iconic ""Pepe the Frog"" meme, has carved out a significant niche in the meme coin marketplace. It reached its highest market value of $0.0000245 in 2024, often brought up in discussions regarding community-supported cryptocurrencies. PEPE's growth is linked to its meme origin, resonating with users who appreciate its internet roots. Despite its popularity, the future success of PEPE depends on active community participation and thoughtful developments within its network. 4. Floki (FLOKI): A Community-Centric NFT Platform Named after Elon Musk’s pet, Floki combines distinctive branding with practical features such as liquidity lockers and NFT infrastructures. Its community, known as the ""Vikings,"" plays a vital role in its prominence within the crypto space. Floki has drawn interest with its initiatives like the NFT metaverse and mechanisms for reducing token supply. Floki's platform remains a point of interest for those investigating new cryptos that offer both utility and community engagement. As it continues to evolve, Floki frequently appears in discussions about impactful, community-driven cryptocurrencies. Key Altcoins to Consider Now In the swiftly expanding crypto market, identifying platforms that offer both innovation and potential for growth is a significant endeavor. While Dogecoin, PEPE, and Floki have established their market positions, BlockDAG distinguishes itself with its advanced Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, impressive scalability, and robust security. With crypto presale revenue hitting $155 million and a $1 million giveaway, BlockDAG attracts broad interest. For those looking at the cryptocurrency presale market, BlockDAG provides a compelling option, promising both immediate and long-term benefits, setting it apart from other leading digital currencies.

Here’s Bullish Oracle Tom Lee’s Latest Insights","Fundstrat Global Advisors Chief Investment Officer Tom Lee confidently predicted in a forecast that Bitcoin will close “well above $100,000” before the end of 2024. Speaking on CNBC, Lee touched on the growing momentum in the cryptocurrency market despite recent price hesitations around six-figure figures. Lee pointed to the limited supply of Bitcoin on over-the-counter exchanges as a key factor driving this potential surge. He suggested that the limited supply could lead to a “big chase” as prices rise, creating further upward pressure. While he acknowledged that the psychological resistance is at $100,000, he said he was optimistic that Bitcoin could break out decisively in the next four weeks. Related News: Why Has The Bitcoin Price Never Surpassed $100,000? Here's an Analyst's View That bullish sentiment also aligns with Lee’s broader outlook for financial markets.

ETH was last trading just above $3,600, per TradingView data. US Ethereum ETFs saw bigger inflows than US Bitcoin ETFs last Friday of $332.9 million, as US institutional investors increasingly warm to the asset. The Ethereum ecosystem is also booming. Over $16 billion in new USDT tokens were minted on Ethereum last month, whilst the total value of crypto locked in smart contracts on the chain has surged back to $72 billion, its highest since early 2022.

A yield-bearing Ethereum ETF would be a far more attractive proposition than the current Ethereum ETF to many traditional investors and could bolster inflows.

As a result of growing bullish narratives surrounding Ethereum and its ecosystem moving forward, few would be surprised to see the price charge above $4,000 this month and mount a challenge of the 2021 all-time highs in the $4,800s. If prior altcoin seasons are any guide, the Ethereum price could charge more than 2x higher from its prior record highs and on towards $10,000. So that could mean gains of around 3x are possible for ETH from current levels. Impressive stuff. However, for some in crypto markets, this upside potential won’t be enough, with many investors instead hunting for the next 100x project that will make them rich. In their hunt for outsized returns, these investors often turn to the micro-cap meme coin markets. Many get caught up in FOMO and end up getting burnt by scam meme coins and pump-and-dump schemes. A better option might be to invest in meme coin presales that are already seeing surging momentum and interest. One of the top projects being watched by investors at crypto news.com is a “hidden” meme coin called Flockerz (FLOCK) that has been going under the radar up until now. Here is everything you need to know about this exciting new vote-to-earn DAO-powered meme coin, and why analysts at crypto news.com rank it as one of their top meme coins to buy now .

Here they have a chance to earn more FLOCK every time they vote on DAO proposals, whilst presale investors are also benefitting from massive staking rewards, which were last around 575% per the official website.

37143576,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=621581,1733162847,Standard Chartered’s Libeara to launch tokenized money market fund on Ethereum,"Libeara, a tokenization platform developed by SC Ventures, Standard Chartered Bank’s fintech innovation and investment arm., plans to launch a US dollar tokenized money market fund in Singapore. The head of business development at Libeara, Alexandre Deschatres, reportedly disclosed this in an interview with Hong Kong newspaper Xin Bao. According to the reports , the tokenization platform will launch the fund on Ethereum in partnership with FundBridge Capital, a licensed fund manager in Singapore, and Wellington Asset Management in the US. Deschartres stated that the fund will launch on the Ethereum mainnet, and they will first evaluate the liquidity of US Treasury bonds before proceeding with the launch. If it goes as planned, this will add another to the growing list of tokenized real-world assets (RWA) issued through Libeara since the platform launched in 2023. While details of the new money market fund remain uncertain, Libeara has a strong relationship with FundBridge Capital. They launched the first tokenized Singapore-Dollar Government Bond Fund for eligible investors in 2023. Since then, it has been used to issue other tokenized funds on Ethereum, with plans to expand to other chains, including Avalanche, Solana, and Arbitrum. The platform provides the technology needed to onboard accredited investors, allowing them to subscribe to and redeem units of tokenized funds directly on the chain. The enterprise-grade tokenization platform leverages the expertise and technology of blockchain-native companies such as Fireblocks, Fazz, Chainalysis, Letsbloom, and Chekk. The tokenization sector continues to grow Meanwhile, the announcement highlights the continued growth of tokenization, particularly among traditional financial institutions. Demand for tokenized RWA has risen over the last few months, with US treasury bonds accounting for a significant portion of the total tokenized RWA. This is due to the participation of major firms such as BlackRock, Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), and Franklin Templeton, as well as the emergence of a more crypto-friendly administration in the US. Many believe that regulatory clarity around stablecoins and cryptocurrencies will boost tokenization efforts. Interestingly, the total value of RWA on-chain increased by 2.33% to reach $13.54 billion in the last 30 days, while asset holders also increased by 2.46% to reach 66,617. However, this is a mere drop in the ocean compared to the projections of many financial institutions, including Standard Chartered, which expects the sector to be worth $30 trillion by 2030. Regulators embrace tokenization in several forms While the $30 trillion projection may seem like a moonshot, recent regulatory developments suggest it is possible. Spanish financial regulator CNMV recently approved the first tokenization issuance in the country, certifying Ursus-3 Capital as Entity Responsible for Registration and Registration (ERIR). The firm, in partnership with Onyze, will now be able to facilitate the issuance of on-chain tokenized assets on distributed ledger technology (DLT) networks for other companies within the country. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also recently introduced the Digital Bond Grant Scheme (DBGS) to incentivize the growth of tokenized bonds. The grant, up to 2.5 million Hong Kong dollars ($321,200), is offered to eligible issuers of digital bonds in the city. Beyond that, there are expectations that regulatory clarity on stablecoins, which is already happening worldwide, could also boost the growth of the tokenization sector as regulated stablecoins will be used for real-time settlement of on-chain transactions. In Europe, this clarity has already arrived in the Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) Act, which provides guidelines for issuing electronic money tokens (EMTs). Although the US does not yet have clear regulations on stablecoins, many expect this to happen as soon as 2025. Unsurprisingly, analysts have predicted that stablecoins will see massive growth in adoption over the next few years and could soon make up 10% of the US M2 and foreign exchange transactions.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

As the PolitiFi scene continues to carve out its niche in 2024, FreeDum Fighters is quickly emerging as the top token to buy in December, especially as it attracts politically inclined crypto enthusiasts looking for massive gains. Positioning itself as a key player beyond the election cycle, FreeDum Fighters is evolving to tap into the broader meme coin sector. Its growth is set to continue as the political landscape shifts, particularly with President-elect Trump’s assumption of office next year. This evolution makes it a top pick for investors looking to capitalize on political momentum and the broader meme coin market. With only five days remaining in the presale, the opportunity to buy $ DUM at its current price of $0.000113 is rapidly closing. The price is set to rise as the presale enters its final stages – don’t miss out on your chance to get in before it’s too late. Politifi tokens reshape the crypto landscape, with FreeDum Fighters leading the charge The PolitiFi sector has dramatically impacted the crypto world in 2024. With meme coins now valued at nearly half a billion dollars and recent 24-hour trading volumes hitting over $355 million, it’s clear this subsector is here to stay. Tokens like MAGA Hat ($MAGA) and Fight to MAGA ($FIGHT) have posted solid gains of 23.2% and 9.2%, respectively, while Patriot ($PATRIOT) has surged by 33% over the past week. Even in a broader meme coin market that dipped 0.83% in the past 24 hours, PolitiFi tokens are showing impressive resilience. Source: CoinGecko / MAGA Hat The appeal of PolitiFi tokens lies in their ability to inject humor into the often intense and divisive world of politics. Tokens like Doland Tremp ($TREMP), Joe Boden ($BODEN), and Kamala Horris ($KAMA) – which intentionally twist the names of political figures with bastardized cartoon representations – have captured attention for their satire. And no other meme coin project understands this blend of humor and politics like FreeDum Fighters. FreeDum Fighters pivots back to its PolitiFi roots (i.e., meme coins) by incorporating Dogecoin and Pepe. Dogecoin joins the MAGATRON and Dark MAGA cohort, while Pepe aligns with Sleepy Joe and Kamacop 9000. Through these pairings, FreeDum Fighters taps into a unique, meme-driven political dynamic that positions itself at the forefront as the PolitiFi landscape evolves post-2024. Yet, this is just one part of the story. FreeDum Fighters: Where political stakes meet crypto – a dynamic ecosystem for debate and rewards Since launching its presale in late October, FreeDum Fighters has proven it’s not just a meme coin – it’s a platform where political stakes meet crypto. Like Polymarket, it offers a space to engage with political dynamics, but with a uniquely meme-driven twist. The characters MAGATRON and Kamacap 9000 represent two staking pools, allowing $DUM holders to stake their tokens and earn rewards. While Kamacap 9000 boasted a higher APY due to fewer tokens competing for rewards, MAGATRON still dominates despite its lower returns. Why? Because for these investors, it’s not just about financial rewards – it’s about backing a political cause they believe in, one that views Trump as a stronger force for the future of crypto than Harris. Beyond the staking pools, FreeDum Fighters is a dynamic space where politically inclined crypto enthusiasts can passionately debate their views. Users can engage in debates on its social media platforms, with the most compelling arguments earning additional $DUM tokens. This makes it a truly interactive platform where financial and political engagement go hand-in-hand.

37143299,https://blockworks.co/news/xrp-all-time-high-market-cap,1733162400,XRP flips USDT as rally pushes market cap to all-time high,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . XRP’s stunning 380% rally in the past month has catapulted it into the crypto spotlight. It has not only flipped solana (SOL) in market capitalization, but also Tether (USDT) today. With a market cap already at all-time highs, and now a fully diluted valuation (FDV) twice that of SOL, XRP’s ascent reflects a mix of regulatory clarity, network adoption and speculative fervor. Political winds and market sentiment The conclusion of Ripple Labs’ protracted legal battle with the US SEC is one driver of XRP’s explosive growth. After years of uncertainty, the $125 million penalty imposed was far below the SEC’s initial $2 billion demand , removing a massive overhang on XRP and allowing institutional and retail investors to re-enter the market with confidence. The significance of XRP’s legal victory transcends its price action, according to attorney John E. Deaton. Deaton is a prominent advocate for XRP holders who sued the SEC over its 2020 enforcement action. He referred to the SEC’s claim that all XRP tokens were illegal, regardless of their use case or the circumstances under which they were acquired, unprecedented “gross overreach.” The US election has also played a role in XRP’s ascent. Trump’s victory has been interpreted as a signal not only for potentially more favorable cryptocurrency regulations, but also toward specifically favoring “homegrown” networks, initially launched by US companies. That’s helped drive bids in similar stars of prior cycles . Top performers (from the top 100) since the election (H/T Hsaka ) There’s also a nostalgia factor, says Mena Theodorou, co-founder at crypto exchange Coinstash. “The resurgence of many of these older coins highlights the muscle memory of retail traders , who likely got their first exposure to the crypto markets through these coins and are now returning to their favourites as they re-enter the current bull market,” Theodorou told Blockworks. The result is that, for many, XRP represents a “comeback story,” building momentum through both narrative and a bit of substance. The rise of XRP memecoins Another more recent factor in XRP’s expansion is the proliferation of memecoins on the XRP Ledger. Tokens such as DROP, SIGMA and RPLS have sparked interest among the gambling crowd (if they can figure out how to use the chain). Low transaction costs and high throughput are available in every ecosystem these days, so this could be a temporary rotation play. Memecoins have a penchant to attract retail investors, but meme trading volumes on XRPL are a modest $78 million over the past 24 hours. ETF speculation Beyond memecoins and political tailwinds, speculation around the approval of XRP-focused ETFs is one final driver. As Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas notes, the introduction of ETFs would likely “open the floodgates” for institutional capital. Newfound regulatory clarity has also positioned XRP as a viable alternative to Solana and Ethereum for institutional adoption simply because of its size, even as few in the technical community take it seriously. XRP’s price action reflects this optimism, with the market pricing in a high probability of approval given recent developments. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, for his part, has described an ETF as “inevitable.” The crypto asset XRP has already attracted attention from firms like Bitwise and 21Shares, whose filings for ETFs could further legitimize and amplify XRP’s appeal to institutional investors. The SEC’s initial deadlines for a decision on the ETF filings are in May and June next year, respectively. As the third-largest crypto asset, XRP is impossible to ignore. But whether it can sustain its newfound favor, however, will depend on its ability to translate hype into lasting adoption.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) says the banking giant has admitted it’s liable for failing to discover and stop misconduct by its relationship managers. The agency says the managers provided incorrect information to clients while executing 24 over-the-counter bond transactions, which resulted in those customers being overcharged. According to the MAS, JPMorgan did not have a proper system in place to make sure its managers complied with the predetermined client spread agreements. “The bank has refunded the overcharged fees to affected clients. The bank has also enhanced its pricing frameworks and internal controls to prevent the recurrence of such misconduct.” JPMorgan says the issue affected a “very small” percentage of total trades processed. “In 2020, after completing our internal review, JPMorgan Private Bank undertook a comprehensive update to its internal controls, monitoring and training framework to ensure our trade governance, pricing transparency and compliance principles continue to be upheld.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In a post on the social media platform X, Armstrong says that the US anti-money laundering (AML) policies should be reviewed by President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) – a new agency that aims to reduce government waste. “Anti Money Laundering (AML) regulations have been a policy failure. They cost ~$213 billion annually, harm legitimate consumers (as we’ve seen with these de-banking stories), and only manage to stop ~0.2% of illicit activity according to the UN. Sounds like a job for DOGE.” Armstrong also suggests having a “sunset provision” on all laws to automatically retire them after a certain amount of time unless Congress votes to keep them. The Coinbase CEO also shares data that only 0.05% to 0.2% of criminal proceeds are intercepted, indicating that over 99% of illicit funds successfully evade detection. In addition, banks have shelled out $321 billion in fines since 2008 for compliance failures and crimes related to money laundering. Armstrong recently alleged that Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren was likely involved in the de-banking of 30 tech and crypto founders. “Can confirm this is true. It was one of the most unethical and un-American things that happened in the Biden administration, and my guess is we’ll find Elizabeth Warren’s fingerprints all over it (Biden himself was probably unaware).” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Litecoin Price Analysis: Can LTC Deliver an XRP-Style Breakout or Will Shorts Prevail? $LTC shorts are back in full force Liquidation #2? pic.twitter.com/GTfR8BLotY — Bugo Myers (@thedonhu) December 2, 2024 As open interest racks up high in short positions, the tension around Litecoin price is palpable, with LTC currently trading at a market price of $121 (representing a 24-hour change of +1.64%). This comes after the Litecoin price bounced hard from moving average support, bolstered by XRP’s strong performance, which saw XRP overtake SOL on the Weekend . Breaking to the upside comes after days of sustained ascendant moves, propped up by tight support from the 20DMA since the beginning of November. With the 20DMA now left standing at $108, it appears Litecoin is in the midst of a bullish rally, with price action currently probing resistance at $125 after initial rejection was met with a well-defended consolidation above $115 by holders. The upside move has seen the RSI over-heat, however, this is rapidly cooling down to lower levels amid the consolidation, suggesting upside movements could be on the cards soon. As it stands, upside targeting remains above resistance at $130 (a possible +9.4% move), while downside risk could see LTC plummet back down to 20DMA support at $108.5 (a potential -9.17% drop). This leaves Litecoin with a mediocre risk: reward ratio of just 1.03 on the short-time frame, which is relatively unalluring for most investors, yet, this doesn’t mean there’s not exciting opportunities available in the crypto market today.

He noted the following in his X post: “Turns out, the only ‘efforts of others’ that truly moved crypto markets—by causing massive and prolonged artificial suppression—were those of the SEC.” Turns out, the only ‘efforts of others’ that truly moved crypto markets—by causing massive and prolonged artificial suppression—were those of the SEC. — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) December 2, 2024 Previously, Alderoty had slammed the SEC for bragging about its record fines collected, and had compared it to a professor boasting about their highest-ever class failure rate and the most cheating scandals. He had highlighted that it was not a measure of success, but rather an indictment of oversight gone terribly wrong, driven by perverse incentives. The SEC under Gensler has faced widespread criticism over its hostile approach towards the crypto industry. The agency, under Gensler, sued Ripple in December 2020, alleging it of violating the law by selling XRP without first registering it as a security. The agency then filed lawsuits against several digital asset companies, including Coinbase Global and Binance Holdings. Light At The End? Analyst anticipate that legal battles between crypto companies and the SEC may be “dismissed or settled” under the Trump administration. Recently, the former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo also urged regulatory agencies to drop several cases, including Ripple’s. In a recent Fox Business interview on Nov. 26, Giancarlo said, “It’s time for regulatory agencies to drop a lot of these cases.” When asked if the SEC should drop the Ripple case specifically, Giancarlo responded: “I think they should.” Recently, amidst the news of Gensler stepping down in January has contributed to XRP’s price increase. Digital assets flagged as “unregistered securities” in previous SEC litigation, such as ADA and SOL, have also benefited from this positive sentiment. “XRP was in an accumulation phase for nearly three years—around 900 days. The duration of such a phase often determines the strength of the subsequent rally, so it’s no surprise that from November 4, XRP has surged around 404%,” noted Arthur Azizov, the chief executive of crypto exchange and payment processor B2BinPay, as per a Forbes report. The improving regulatory landscape and its immense potential could further push the XRP price beyond its 2017 bull run all-time high in 2025.

Blockchain data from Arkham Intelligence revealed that a wallet labeled “US Government: Silk Road DOJ Seized Funds” moved 19,800 BTC to a new address before depositing the funds to Coinbase Prime. The wallet had no previous transaction history, leading to speculation that the government may be preparing to sell the assets. Historically, government-seized BTC sales have triggered significant market reactions. Earlier this year, similar sales led to sharp declines in Bitcoin prices. However, today the impact of the transfer was more subtle, with Bitcoin prices falling just over 1% to around $95,800 following the news. Related News: JPMorgan Releases New Report on Bitcoin Network Following Recent Volatility Despite this transaction, the U.S. government still holds approximately $18 billion worth of confiscated cryptocurrency, according to Arkham Intelligence. The BTC in question stems from a 2022 Department of Justice (DOJ) case in which over 50,000 BTC was seized and a Silk Road user, James Zhong, was arrested. Zhong pleaded guilty to wire fraud after authorities accused him of abusing Silk Road’s transaction system in 2012.

But the message ended with a ‘stay tuned’ hint. Using the brand of the now-defunct corporation also led to the creation of numerous Enron-themed meme tokens on Pump.fun. Rumors are emerging from an X account using the @Enron handle, hinting at a possible new token. The account itself states it has not issued its own crypto token, but leads to a site with a one-week countdown to an undisclosed event. Soon after posting the token teaser, the @Enron handle deleted the message. Just hours after the message spread, Community Notes outed the content as a crypto scam masquerading as the bankrupted energy corporation. However, the message already had an effect on the meme token market. The real Enron, notorious for its accounting scandal in the early 2000s, warned through its X account that it did not launch any type of coin or token. On the other hand, Enron hinted the possibility is not out of the question. The newly active Enron account had to explain its plans for the crypto space, after receiving thousands of queries on creating a digital token. For now, there is no official asset or contract address tied to Enron. The speculations around an eventual token launch follow the announcement of Enron’s plan to rebuild as a clean energy company. On Monday, Enron sent out a press release announcing its relaunch as a company aiming to solve the global energy crisis. The press release did not mention a new coin or token but accelerated the speculation and new asset launches through Pump.fun. The only thing tangentially related to a token is a mention that Enron would use ‘permissionless innovation’ and decentralized technology. The account using the brand of Enron also seems to be aware of token scams, since it ended its recent X announcements with a warning not to follow any links or offers on behalf of its brand. Enron still holds the record for the biggest corporate bankruptcy at $63.4B, far surpassing the scale of any crypto crash. Is there really an Enron token? Token creators on Pump.fun are extremely fast, and have already created at least a dozen assets under the same ticker. These tokens vary, with some appearing official and others humorously themed, such as referencing Enron’s infamous accounting scandals. The crypto community is well aware that the Enron moniker was a publicity stunt but ran with it as the next hot theme on Pump.fun. There are several contenders for the most curious token based on Enron’s fame. The first one is the OG Enron token, created more than eight months ago. That token has not left the bonding curve, with just $10.4K in liquidity. An early asset with claims of being the OG token has also surfaced, though with only 267 holders and $23K in available liquidity. Several tokens with a non-serious profile were also created, all holding $6.4K in liquidity. The last such token was launched seven days ago, before Enron’s relaunch message. The other contender is the most liquid Solana-based token tapping Enron’s fame. The asset still holds only $134K in liquidity, but it has at least graduated to Raydium. There are multiple competing tokens, but some feature more active wallet clusters and at least create the impression of activity. Social media users noted one of the tokens , with 2,344 users, pumped just days before Enron sent out its press release and started producing X content. There is no way to know who pumped those tokens, which take very little to rally and line up among trending assets. The appearance of a copycat trend further complicates the choice of which version to support. Some Enron-themed tokens on Pump.fun have reached market caps exceeding $500 million, despite having low liquidity. These assets appear to attract traders with a sense of financial nihilism, who are more interested in pumping prices for symbolic or ironic reasons than for long-term value. There has been talk of creating another irrational cult to pump a selected Enron token version and put it among the more valuable memes. For now, no Enron-themed tokens have found market makers, and are just another hot short-term trend among meme assets. The tokens launched at a time when the meme market recovered above a total market cap of $123B , while funds rolled over from former stars into a new batch of rising tokens.

These Meme Coins Promise Sky-High ROI for 2024 Investors!,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing this December with meme coins making headlines once again. While Dogecoin continues to captivate with its golden cross momentum, new contenders are entering the ring with big promises and even bigger communities. Leading the charge is BTFD Coin , which has already raised over $500,000 during its presale, and Mog Coin , an underdog that’s riding on a wave of investor optimism after a rocky week. Meme coins have always brought an undeniable energy to the crypto market. From Dogecoin’s iconic rise to the more recent success of tokens like Shiba Inu, these coins have proven that community and virality can sometimes outshine even the most sophisticated tech. Now, BTFD Coin and Mog Coin are staking their claim as the best crypto presales to watch for massive returns. Let’s dive into what makes these coins stand out and why they might just be the best crypto coins to buy in 2024. BTFD Coin: Flipping Market Lows into Life-Changing Wins BTFD Coin isn’t just another token; it’s a movement. Short for “Buy The F***ing Dip,” this coin has turned a trader’s mantra into a rallying cry for those who thrive on market chaos. With its presale kicking off on November 26, 2024, at a starting price of $0.000004, BTFD has already stormed through 25% of its 16-stage presale journey, raising over $500,000 and selling more than 15 billion coins. The numbers are impressive, but what really sets BTFD apart is its ecosystem. At its core is a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game designed to engage and reward its vibrant community. Imagine logging in, playing a fun game, and earning real value. Add to that a staking rewards system offering a whopping 90% APY, and it’s clear why investors are flocking to this presale. The Bulls Squad, a community of like-minded investors, embodies the coin’s ethos: turning every market dip into an opportunity. Let’s talk returns. If you had invested $10,000 during Stage 5 of the presale at $0.00005 per coin, you’d have bagged 200 million BTFD tokens. By the end of the presale, with the coin priced at $0.0006, that same investment would balloon to $120,000. It’s no wonder crypto analysts are calling BTFD Coin the best crypto presale to watch in 2024. And the excitement doesn’t stop there. With plans to list on major exchanges post-presale and the community’s enthusiasm showing no signs of slowing down, BTFD Coin is set to redefine what meme coins can achieve. If you’re looking for a chance to get in early on the next big thing, this might just be your golden ticket. Mog Coin: From Underdog to Rising Star Mog Coin might not have the same flashy start as BTFD, but it’s a force to be reckoned with. Currently trading at $0.000002368, Mog Coin has faced some challenges recently, including a 4.2% dip in 24 hours and a 19.6% decline over the week. However, it’s still up by 18% this month, showcasing its resilience in a volatile market. What’s keeping investors hooked? For starters, Mog Coin’s market cap is holding steady at $920 million, with a 24-hour trading volume of $25 million. While the trading volume dipped by 46%, analysts remain optimistic. One prominent trader even predicts that Mog Coin could rally to $0.000014, which would be a sixfold increase from its current price. For those doing the math, that’s a massive gain worth considering. Mog Coin’s story is one of grit and potential. Despite its recent challenges, it’s building a reputation as a meme coin with staying power. Its community—much like Dogecoin’s—is fiercely loyal, rallying around the coin’s ethos and long-term vision. The buzz around Mog Coin suggests that it’s not just a flash in the pan but a contender for those looking to diversify their portfolios. If you’re scouting for the best crypto presale opportunities, Mog Coin deserves a spot on your radar. It’s got the backing of a dedicated community, and its growth potential is hard to ignore. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a crypto newbie, Mog Coin offers a unique mix of risk and reward that’s worth a second look. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, 2024 is shaping up to be a landmark year for meme coins. BTFD Coin has set the stage with a presale performance that’s nothing short of electrifying, offering a rare blend of innovation, community, and life-changing ROI potential. Meanwhile, Mog Coin continues to prove its resilience and potential, cementing its place as a rising star in the meme coin ecosystem. If you’ve been waiting for the perfect moment to dive into the crypto market, this is it. Don’t let these opportunities pass you by. Make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity with BTFD Coin’s presale or explore the untapped potential of Mog Coin’s momentum .

37142873,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51195,1733161501,"BTFD Coin Exceed $500K, Bonk Faces Volatility, and Fartcoin Gains Traction","What a whirlwind December has been for crypto enthusiasts. Just last week, BTFD Coin burst onto the scene with a presale that’s already raised over $500,000, zooming through 25% of its 16-stage journey in a single day. Meanwhile, Bonk has seen its popularity surge on social media despite recent price struggles, and Fartcoin is gaining traction as a quirky but promising meme coin. If you’re wondering which of these might be the best crypto coin to buy, you’re not alone. Over the years, meme coins have become more than just digital laughs; they’ve turned into serious profit engines. From Dogecoin’s early hype to Shiba Inu’s jaw-dropping run, meme coins have taught us that community and timing can trump even the best tech. Now, BTFD Coin is taking the meme game to a whole new level with a killer P2E game, juicy staking rewards, and a “Bulls Squad” community that’s all about flipping market dips into wins. Let’s break down why BTFD Coin, Bonk, and Fartcoin are trending as top contenders for the best crypto coin to buy in 2024. Spoiler alert: there’s a lot to get hyped about. BTFD Coin: Flipping Market Lows into Big Wins BTFD Coin has wasted no time grabbing the spotlight. With a presale price starting at $0.000004, it’s now in its sixth stage at $0.000058. Over 10 billion coins have been sold, raising more than $500,000 in just days. That’s a staggering pace for a newcomer, but it’s not just the numbers that have people talking. It’s the vibe. BTFD—short for “Buy The F***ing Dip”—isn’t just a coin; it’s a rallying cry for traders who thrive in chaos. The presale’s momentum has been nothing short of electric. Within 24 hours, BTFD blitzed through 25% of its 16-stage presale journey, raising $150,000 in that first-day frenzy. Early adopters are already seeing the potential for huge returns, especially with the price set to hit $0.0006 once it’s listed. That’s a 10x gain for those who got in at the ground floor. Take this example: Imagine you dropped $4,000 in Stage 5 when the price was $0.00005. That would’ve scored you 80 million BTFD Coins. By the end of the presale, at $0.0006 per coin, your $4,000 investment balloons to $48,000. Let that sink in. What really sets BTFD apart is its ecosystem. A P2E game is in the works, designed to keep the community engaged and earning. There’s also a staking rewards system offering a sweet 90% APY. And with the “Bulls Squad” pushing its ethos of turning market downturns into golden opportunities, BTFD isn’t just a coin; it’s a movement. If you’re looking for the best crypto coin to buy this December, it’s hard to argue against the numbers and the vibe. Bonk: Social Media Sensation with Challenges Bonk has had a rollercoaster year. As Solana’s flagship meme coin, it’s built a strong community driven by social media hype and grassroots campaigns. But let’s be real: it’s not all smooth sailing. Bonk recently saw a 23% price drop in just a week, thanks to overall market volatility. Still, its die-hard investors are holding out hope for a comeback. What keeps Bonk in the conversation is its foundation as a community-first project. Social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit are buzzing with Bonk memes and discussions. But despite its popularity, Bonk’s lack of utility compared to newer meme coins is a glaring issue. Investors are starting to look elsewhere, with many turning to upcoming ICOs like FXGuys for potentially bigger returns. That said, Bonk’s volatility could still appeal to short-term traders looking to capitalise on quick price swings. If you’ve got the stomach for risk, Bonk’s social media buzz and speculative nature might just make it the best crypto coin to buy for a fast flip. But keep in mind, its long-term growth will depend on whether the team can deliver meaningful updates to its utility and ecosystem. Fartcoin: Quirky, Bold, and Full of Potential Fartcoin is exactly what it sounds like—a meme coin with a name that’ll make you laugh out loud. But don’t let its humour fool you. This quirky project is quietly building a loyal community and gaining traction in the meme coin space. Its roadmap is ambitious, featuring plans for community-driven initiatives, partnerships, and even a Fart-themed NFT collection. What’s got everyone talking about Fartcoin is its ability to combine internet culture with solid engagement strategies. It’s the kind of project that appeals to Gen Z and Millennials who value humour as much as they do potential profits. And with its developers teasing upcoming collaborations with influencers and meme creators, Fartcoin’s star is on the rise. But here’s the kicker: Fartcoin’s community engagement is off the charts. Whether it’s meme contests, charity drives, or just a constant stream of hilarious content, Fartcoin knows how to keep its audience hooked. While it may not yet have the financial backing of projects like BTFD, its charm and grassroots appeal make it a dark horse in the race for the best crypto coin to buy in 2024. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin, Bonk, and Fartcoin each bring something unique to the table. BTFD Coin’s explosive presale growth and innovative ecosystem make it the frontrunner for life-changing returns. Bonk’s social media-driven popularity keeps it in the spotlight, even as it faces challenges. And Fartcoin’s quirky branding and community engagement make it a fresh and exciting contender. Don’t wait too long to make your move. The crypto market never sleeps, and opportunities like these don’t last forever. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your spot in one of the most exciting crypto projects of 2024.

37142495,https://nulltx.com/?p=135092,1733161063,"ETHEREUM PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (December 2) – ETH Remains Bullish Despite Losing 3%, Bigger Explosion Ahead","Despite struggling with volatility in the past few days, Ethereum’s price broke higher to tap the $3,700 zone today. The price is down but bigger moves lie ahead as it targets the current high while gathering liquidity. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum did not slow down buying in the past week despite witnessing volatility contraction on the way up. The contraction, which started from around $3,000, suggests a serious liquidity gathering on the daily timeframe. From the look of things, the price will likely explode massively to a new all-time high soon. As seen on the daily chart, the price broke above a monthly resistance level last week and increased steadily to a daily high of $3,760. It saw a rejection there and dropped below $3,600, looking for a retest. Rolling back gains could trigger a small price retracement, capable of slowing down the bullish rally. The $3,000 level is a key support to watch for such a rebound. Failure to rebound could cause more setbacks in the market before the bulls step back into action. If July’s high provides support, ETH may continue to gather momentum until the price breaks out of the current all-time high. The price currently appeared weak following the latest drops. While the bears are showing interest, more drops can be expected if the supply level increases. ETH’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Pushing above the current daily high, ETH is likely to encounter minor resistance at $4,000 before reclaiming the $4,094 resistance with a major break out to $5,000 For a potential pullback, the immediate support level to consider for drops is $3,497. Below it lies the $3,255 support. If the price further dips, the next level to watch is $3,015. Key Resistance Levels: $3,760, $4,094, $5,000 Key Support Levels: $3,497, $3,255, $3,015 Spot Price: $3,595 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

37142435,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=25756,1733160900,XRP Reclaims Third Spot Amid Huge Rally,"XRP, the cryptocurrency tied to blockchain payments firm Ripple, has reclaimed its position as the third-largest coin by market capitalization, stirring significant reactions within the crypto community. XRP dropped out of the top three in December 2020 when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple, alleging it conducted an “unregistered digital asset securities offering.” With the SEC lawsuit nearing resolution and Ripple securing multiple legal wins in 2024, XRP has surged. Its price saw a notable spike in November following Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election. After lagging behind cryptocurrencies like Tether (USDT), Binance’s BNB, Solana (SOL), and Circle’s USDC for years, XRP has now climbed back to the third spot, following Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). “This is how it looked before Dec. 22, 2020,” pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton remarked on X. The lawsuit initially caused XRP’s price to plummet from $0.50 to $0.17, erasing over $15 billion in market value. “While the price recovered, XRP spent the next four years at the #7 spot,” Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett noted in a Dec. 1 post. Despite its decline, XRP consistently remained within the top 10 cryptocurrencies, signaling its resilience. In November, XRP gained further traction online, with Google searches for “XRP” surpassing those for “crypto” multiple times. According to Google Trends, XRP even briefly overtook Ether (ETH) in search popularity but has yet to surpass Bitcoin. To overtake Ether in market capitalization, XRP would need to rise significantly. Crypto trader Christopher Jaszczynski, known as MMCrypto, predicts, “XRP will flip ETH when its price surges to $7.75.” At present, Ether’s market cap exceeds XRP by 219%, suggesting that XRP still has a considerable gap to close before challenging ETH for the second spot.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | XRP,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/xep-reclaims-third-spot-amid-huge-rally/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37142345,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373120,1733160808,Here’s Why Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) 10% Daily Correction Could be Good News: Analysts,"TL:DR; Shiba Inu surged on Sunday but retraced hard on Monday, alongside the rest of the market. However, certain analysts believe this could be the calm before the storm, and they even envision a new all-time high for the popular meme coin. SHIB’s Monday Downfall CryptoPotato reported yesterday the positive price developments around the second-biggest meme coin. At the time, SHIB was the top performer from the larger-cap alts, having surged by over 15% on a 24-hour scale. As a result, SHIB skyrocketed to its highest levels since March this year of over $0.000033. However, the entire crypto landscape changed on Monday, with many assets plunging hard. Bitcoin, for example, dumped from over $98,000 to under $95,000 amid some potential profit taking from whales. Shiba Inu’s largest native token was not spared either, dumping by nearly 10% on a daily scale to well below $0.00003. However, popular X analyst Diamond-Hands noted that SHIB’s correction could be over now, and the asset seems primed for a new wave up from this point. Correction done on $SHIB WE MIGHT GET ANOTHER WAVE UP FROM HERE #ShibaInu https://t.co/Buw6BtI6CV pic.twitter.com/h6M0Uwz6jB — DIAMOND-HANDS (@TamngwaB) December 2, 2024 Ali, another well-known technical analyst, has $0.000037 in sight and believes the asset could reach that level as long as it remains above the crucial support at $0.000025, which still holds. Naturally, there are certain SHIB-related pages that continue to be highly bullish about the asset’s perspective in the near future, highlighting the potential of reaching a new all-time high. To do so, SHIB would need to triple its price from its current levels as its ATH stands at $0.00008616, according to CoinGecko. Major Strength Javon Marks told his nearly 50,000 followers on X that the meme coin’s rally over the weekend had confirmed “another bull pattern,” which shows its potential to be “further joining the bull show.” As such, the analyst noted that $0.000081 is still in play, meaning that SHIB could soon indeed target that aforementioned ATH. $SHIB (Shiba Inu), after recently confirming another bull pattern, looks to be further joining the bull show as prices are now showing signs of MAJOR STRENGTH!

37142379,https://nulltx.com/?p=135088,1733160803,"BITCOIN PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (December 2) – Bitcoin Sets To Reaccumulate Following A Slight Breakdown, Looks For A Solid Ground","Regaining momentum last week, Bitcoin failed to push above its current high following a steady shrink in volatility. The trend still looks bullish in the long term but will likely correct lower before resuming the rally. Bitcoin’s trend remains bullish on the daily chart but the price looks stalled over the past week after several failed attempts to push above the psychological $100k level. The newly tapped all-time high has been an obstacle to Bitcoin’s next move for almost two weeks. Meanwhile, the bulls are still eyeing the mentioned psychological level, but they appear weak at the moment. This level should manifest when they return. While the bulls continue to take a break, regrouping for the next leg up, Bitcoin’s lost buzz and initiated drops today. It currently trades in the $95,000 range as it forms a double-top pattern on the daily chart. A further decline could bring a major correction in the short term before skyrocketing to a new ATH. Losing momentum should provide more opportunity to reaccumulate for bigger moves. That said, the temporal halt in bullish has given life to many lower-cap altcoins in the past week. If Bitcoin continues to hover, we can expect more rallies amongst some undervalued assets before deciding on where next to head. For now, the bull season remains intact. BTC’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Now that BTC is back in the $95,000 range, we may see more sell-offs in the coming days. The closest support level lies at $90,791 – last week’s low. If this support fails to produce a bounce, $85,072 and $81,500 are the next level to keep in mind. Towards the upside, Bitcoin must break above the current $99,588 high to sustain bullish momentum. Tapping $100k, the next level to consider for buying would be $103,000 Key Resistance Levels: $99,588, $100,000, $103,000 Key Support Levels: $90,791, $85,072, $81,500 Spot Price: $95,200 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

42387585,19da3881-c6e7-4b4b-9046-0e5734b49ed3,1733160798,Silk Road Bitcoin Worth Nearly $2B Moved to Coinbase Prime,"Nearly $2 billion worth of forfeited bitcoin (BTC) linked to the Silk Road website were moved to crypto exchange Coinbase Prime on Monday.  A wallet tagged as ""U.S. Government: Silk Road DOJ Confiscated Funds"" transferred 19,800 bitcoin on Monday to a fresh address with no prior history of transactions, blockchain data by Arkham Intelligence showed. The funds were then deposited to Coinbase Prime.  The transfer likely indicates that the government is preparing to sell or has already sold the assets. Earlier instances of government selling this year sparked sizable selloffs in bitcoin, but the action today — so far — has been more muted, with the price dipping a bit more than 1% to the current $95,800 since the news hit. Following this move, the U.S. government still holds $18 billion worth of seized crypto assets, per Arkham.  The Department of Justice announced in 2022 that it seized over 50,000 BTC and arrested James Zhong, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud after the government alleged he manipulated the transaction system of dark web market Silk Road in 2012.  Last month, U.S. district court of Northern California requested involved parties to ""stipulate that government may liquidate some or all"" of the forfeited digital assets related to Silk Road and holding on the funds while an ongoing FOIA action resolves.

This may reshape Brazil’s stance on cryptocurrencies as Brazil’s real is falling drastically. Proposed Ban in Focus The draft, published on Nov. 29, bars VASPs from transferring stablecoins denominated in foreign currencies to self-custodial wallets. The consultation period runs up until Feb. 28, 2025. “The provider of virtual asset services shall not transfer virtual assets denominated in foreign currency to a self-custodial portfolio,” the document reads. Stricter Oversight in the Cryptocurrency Space The central bank’s proposal comes in line with the government’s broader push to increase oversight of the foreign exchange market and track Brazilian capital abroad. Such measures follow 2022 regulations that targeted virtual asset service providers. Key components of the proposal include: The expansion of foreign exchange rules to cover crypto payments, custody, and transactions. VASPs will be compelled to provide the central bank with comprehensive client information and data on transfers. Why Target Self-Custodial Wallets? Self-custodial wallets allow users to manage their assets independently, without any third-party interference. This makes them, by nature, censorship-resistant. According to proponents, though regulations can hamper its use, an outright ban on self-custodial wallets is all but impossible. “They’re closing the exits while BRL is collapsing,” said Carol Souza, co-founder of Area Bitcoin. Economic and Market Implications The proposal comes as the Brazilian real suffered a dramatic decline, falling 23% against the US dollar in 2023 and reaching an all-time low of 6.09 reals per dollar. This has driven many Brazilians toward stablecoins like Tether (USDt) to hedge against currency devaluation. Brazil’s Key Role in Global Stablecoin Markets Brazil is the second-biggest market for stablecoin transactions, as 59.8% of its crypto market is covered by stablecoins. Over the past year, the country has recorded $90 billion in crypto inflows, just behind Argentina’s $91 billion.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/brazil-proposes-ban-stablecoin-withdrawals/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

Cash App , a popular mobile app known for peer-to-peer payments, investing, and crypto transactions, will end its Bitcoin ( BTC ) feature by late December, months after federal authorities raised concerns over the platform’s ability to prevent money laundering. In a notice on its help page, Cash App announced it will “no longer support sending and receiving bitcoin between $cashtags as of December 20th, 2024.” The company noted that users could still send and receive Bitcoin using Lightning Network or the Bitcoin blockchain. Cash App’s notice on the help page | Source: Cash App A check of the Wayback Machine shows no such notice in October, raising questions about the sudden change. Moreover, the change appears to only impact Bitcoin transfers and doesn’t seem to affect other services , such as sending stocks or cash via cashtags, unique identifiers. A spokesperson for Cash App told crypto.news that the company made this decision to “focus our internal resources on the products and services that Bitcoin holders on Cash App use and value most.” “We’ve notified customers that starting December 20th, we will no longer support peer-to-peer bitcoin transactions between $cashtags. We made this decision to focus our internal resources on the products and services that bitcoin holders on Cash App use and value most.” Cash App’s spokesperson Launched in 2013 as part of Block Inc., Cash App (formerly known as Square Cash) started as a peer-to-peer payment system, similar to PayPal’s Venmo. It has since expanded into a super app with features like Bitcoin and stock purchases, savings, lending, and even pre-paid Visa debit card issued by Sutton Bank. It’s unknown how popular Bitcoin p2p transfers are on Cash App as the platform does not disclose this data. However, regulatory filings show that the crypto aspect was profitable for the company as in Q4 2023, Cash App generated over $65 million in Bitcoin gross profit, up 90% from Q4 2022. In the first none months of 2023, Cash App generated net revenue of more than $10.3 billion, representing around 65% of Block’s net revenue at that time. As of December 2023, the app had 56 million active accounts, but it is unclear how many of them used the crypto services. You might also like: Block’s Cash App Q1 report reveals $2b in BTC revenue Cash App changes offerings amid federal investigation The decision to stop transfers by user tags comes seven months after reports revealed that federal prosecutors are looking into compliance practices at Block, the parent company of Cash App. In May, NBC News reported that Cash App’s design raised compliance risks, with internal documents indicating that “due to the nature of the product customers do not appear to leave stored balances in Cash App very long so our ability to block a stored balance or reject funds is limited. In virtually all situations, balances have been depleted by the time of review.” The report also showed that about 100 pages of internal documents list small transactions involving entities in countries under U.S. sanctions, such as Russia, Iran, Cuba, and Venezuela. In response to that leak, Block said that sanctions risk on Cash App is mitigated by compliance controls and the nature of the customer base, which is focused on U.S. customers. At the time, Cash App told NBC News that the company partners with law enforcement “to help disrupt illegal or illicit activity.” Addressing those events, the spokesperson made it clear in a statement to crypto.news that the decision to end Bitcoin p2p transfers is not connected to the investigation. “$cashtag transactions using U.S. dollars and all other bitcoin features, including the ability to send and receive bitcoin using Lightning and the Bitcoin Network, are not impacted by this update. We remain committed to building innovative, accessible products for customers who use bitcoin on our platform.” Cash App’s spokesperson That wasn’t the first time Block has faced regulatory challenges. In late 2021, the Financial Market Supervisory Committee of the Bank of Lithuania instructed Verse Payments Lithuania UAB, the European version of Cash App, to verify the identities of customers whose information was either incomplete or did not meet the legal requirements for preventing money laundering and terrorist financing.

The team is taking bold steps to ensure the project claws its way to the top of the cat coin meta. Notably, they unveiled Slap-to-Earn, a new mechanism allowing users to earn crypto while playing its quirky cat-slap game. Not only is there a reward incentive for playing the game, but token burns will take place based on Slapometer milestones. So far, there are over 59 million slaps recorded. Slap-to-earn and burning will skyrocket catslap value Popcat or Mog Coin don’t have these features. In the cat coin sector – which is worth over $5 billion – Catslap separates itself with multiple innovations. The burning mechanism helps keep supply low and means incoming capital will have a greater impact on the token price. Visit the Catslap Burned Tokens Dashboard to track all the transactions. Tokens are burned when users unstake their tokens early, and the team also buys back tokens from the open market to burn. Track the progress of this using the newly launched Catslap Buyback Dashboard . The SLAP price is gradually stepping higher as more of these features are revealed. SLAP primed for big move with $4.1 million in liquidity The Catslap team is clearly expecting some major investment. The project has $4.1 million in locked liquidity to ensure the seamless buying and selling of SLAP, even at whale-grade levels. The project’s market cap now sits at $24 million, and its brand awareness is growing stronger. Between its X and Telegram channels, it boasts over 12K followers. Meanwhile, its holder count sits north of 8,000. Catslap now offers two ways to slap. The old way is that users visit the website, select the character they want to slap and get straight to it. Or, the new Slap-to-Earn way: users connect their wallet, start slapping, and earn tokens for their efforts. There is also a new leaderboard that tracks the Slap-to-Earn section separately. Click on the Slap-to-Earn button to view the Catslap leaderboard, which is grouped by countries and individual users. Users can also go to the burn dashboard and see how many tokens are being removed from the market in real time. So far, 38,476,835 SLAP worth $126,846 have been burned. Token buybacks to bolster demand Catslap has yet another buoy from the newly launched buyback mechanism. The buyback dashboard reveals 42,312,186 SLAP tokens have been repurchased from the market, adding $139,492 in buying pressure. The Catslap community is impressed by this comprehensive approach to tokenomics and ecosystem development, which is reflected in the project’s near 50% rally this week. Compound Catslap gains with 40% staking APY SLAP holders can maximize their earning potential by staking their tokens for a 40% APY. Staked tokens will be gradually unlocked over a seven-day window. If you decide to unstake your tokens early, any that haven’t been unlocked yet will be burned permanently. Lastly, Catslap’s exchange listing announcement will come in just three days, giving another buy-side boost. Community members have noticed SLAP appearing on Crypto.com’s ‘most popular’ rankings. It’s not known whether Crypto.com will list SLAP, but this underscores the project’s strong market appeal. Buy SLAP before the next rally Catslap has gained a reputation on the trending Web3 wallet Best Wallet due to the significant gains it has provided so far. Investors can buy SLAP from Best Wallet’s upcoming tokens feature. Alternatively, interested investors can purchase SLAP via the project’s buy widget on its website or via Uniswap.

However, the bank noted that profitability remained significantly below pre-halving levels. “We estimate that Bitcoin miners earned an average of $52,000 per EH/s in daily block reward revenue in November, up 24% from October,” JPMorgan analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote, noting the revenue increases miners achieved throughout the month. The increase in transaction fees following the November 5 U.S. presidential election contributed to what the bank calls “hashprice relief.” Hashprice is a key measure of mining profitability that combines block rewards and transaction fees. Related News: Why Has The Bitcoin Price Never Surpassed $100,000? Here's an Analyst's View The combined market value of the 14 publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies covered by JPMorgan rose 52% in November to $36.2 billion. JPMorgan also reported a 4% month-over-month increase in Bitcoin’s average network hashrate, which reached 731 exahashes per second (EH/s) in November. The company noted that Bitcoin’s annualized volatility also climbed in November, rising to 62% from 42% in October. This volatility presents both opportunities and challenges for miners, as sudden price swings can significantly impact profitability. Despite the improvements, the report noted that miners' gross profits remain around 50% below levels seen before Bitcoin's most recent halving event. *This is not investment advice.

The largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, has listed viral Solana-based ( SOL ) meme coin Moo Deng ( MOODENG ) after a flurry of crypto additions in recent weeks. Last month, Coinbase onboarded Pepe ( PEPE ) and Floki ( FLOKI ) to its trading platform. Like previous meme coin additions, Moo Deng’s price surged after Coinbase’s announcement. DEXScreener data showed a 50% increase in Moo Deng’s market cap within the last 24 hours. https://twitter.com/CoinbaseAssets/status/1863600477910233378 Moo Deng started as a social media sensation on TikTok nearly three months ago. The viral baby hippo caught attention, and Solana developers swiftly created a token. In two months and 21 days, the meme coin has achieved a $555 million market cap.

WisdomTree’s spot XRP ETF application, increasing odds of RLUSD stablecoin approval and strong futures market activity have pushed the XRP market capitalization past the $150 billion mark. However, XRP price predictions from experts suggest that sidelined investors and swing traders may get a better entry point to scale into their long positions, considering the token faces key resistance levels both in its USD and BTC charts. Why Is XRP Pumping Today? XRP’s price chart is the result of a bullish breakout from a 3-year consolidatory triangle. Prominent crypto analysts like Blockchainedbb reveal that the breakout is still playing out and could push the token price to $3.30 in the coming months. XRP has already flipped Solana and Tether in market capitalization, making it the 3rd largest cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. WisdomTree’s S-1 application for an XRP spot ETF has also added to the FOMO, with all eyes on BlackRock and Fidelity. Similarly, the growing likelihood of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin and strong futures market activity is also contributing to the bullish trajectory. The XRP price is now up by nearly 400% since Donald Trump’s victory. The anti-Ripple SEC Chair Gary Gensler is set to resign and be replaced by a pro-crypto head like Paul Atkins. As a result, the spot XRP ETF approval odds are extremely high, as is the likelihood of the SEC dropping or settling its lawsuit against Ripple. This would provide regulatory clarity, result in global partnerships and drive up the institutional demand for XRP. It is not without any reason that a few XRP price predictions have the token trading as high as $18 in the long term. Hey there. I hope you all are fine!Here is the weekly update on $XRP .

While XRP remains an attractive long-term investment, sidelined investors and swing traders can no longer underestimate the possibility of a short-term dip. For instance, the XRP price wicked above its 0.786 Fibonacci level in today’s rally. However, this is a multi-year resistance from the 2017-2018 cycle. It wouldn’t be a surprise if the token dips below this level before its upcoming weekly close. Similarly, a prominent analyst Jacob Canfield reveals that the XRPBTC chart has also hit a multi-year resistance. While a bullish breakout above could result in another 250% rally, the possibility of a bearish rejection cannot be ignored. Consequently, the risk-reward ratio isn’t favouring new long positions at the current price. Sidelined investors can wait for either a successful retest of the $2.50 support or a dip below the $2.00 price mark. Best Crypto To Buy Now? With XRP set to enter another consolidatory phase, the market capital would rotate to other crypto assets with bullish charts. For instance, legendary trader Bluntz reveals that the top Base meme coin Brett could hit a new all-time high in the coming days and enter price discovery. $BRETT just hit 2 billy mcap and flirting with an ATH breakout, quite surprised how little I see it talked about tbh. pic.twitter.com/lNJ0Wbnd4z — Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) December 1, 2024 Similarly, the Moo Deng price could hit a new all-time high as well following its Coinbase listing on Monday. The trending microcap meme coin Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is also nearing its highly-anticipated December launch. The Pepe Unchained presale has already raised nearly $65 million. With the ICO set to end in just 10 days, the whale buys are only ramping up, contributing to the hype and FOMO. PEPU’s in-demand utilities have already separated it from most new meme coins. Its upcoming Layer-2 chain will allow PEPU holders to benefit from extremely low trading costs as well as instant transactions. Meanwhile, the project is also launching Pepe’s Pump Pad, a two-click meme coin launchpad that is expected to be a direct competitor to Solana’s Pump Fun.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS.

Unlike most ERC-20 meme coins, PEPU holders will benefit from extremely low trading costs, near-instantaneous transactions and cutting-edge tools like ETH-PEPU bridge, custom DEX, block explorer, advanced analytics, etc. Experts believe this is the perfect formula to attract retail investment and could be one of the key reasons behind its strong presale performance. Meanwhile, it is also launching Pepe’s Pump Pad, a two-click meme coin launchpad, not unlike Solana’s Pump Fun. Pump Fun has already been a massive success and is one of the key factors behind Solana’s hegemony over the meme coin sector. Popular tokens including Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), Peanut The Squirrel (PNUT) and Moo Deng (MOODENG) all saw explosive growth following their Pump Fun launches, with the first two even reaching multi-billion dollar valuations. Considering Ethereum’s vast user base, it wouldn’t be a surprise if Pepe’s Pump Pad saw similar success and delivered the next 100x meme coins. Moreover, PEPU’s community-centric tokenomics, transparent roadmap and successful security audits have made it a favourite among smart money investors. For instance, the project has allocated 30% of the token supply to staking rewards . Presale buyers can already stake their coins and earn attractive passive income, currently at an APY of over 55%. Is PEPU The Best Meme Coin To Buy? Prominent crypto investor ClayBro, who has over 130k subscribers on YouTube, called Pepe Unchained one of the best meme coins to buy today. In another video, he hinted that PEPU could create the next millionaires. Similarly, smart money investor Cilinix Crypto revealed on Sunday that he purchased even more Pepe Unchained ahead of its December launch on Tier-1 exchanges. He is also not the only one. Whales can’t get enough of this meme coin and aren’t waiting for its launch to ape in. $50k buys are daily occurrences for PEPU, with many deep-pocketed investors buying over $100k worth of the meme coin in a single transaction. These smart money investors are eyeing anywhere between 50x and 100x returns from Pepe Unchained. After all, PEPU remains a microcap meme coin despite its stellar presale performance. Several small-cap tokens have already delivered over 1000x returns amidst the extreme bull market euphoria that has currently gripped the market. There is also a strong speculation of Pepe Unchained being the next Binance listing. After all, the world’s leading crypto exchange has been listing low-cap meme coins with strong community support and in-demand utilities. PEPU checks all these boxes. Interested buyers can visit the project’s presale website and use the over-the-counter widget to buy the meme coin with just a few clicks. However, with just 11 days remaining in the presale end, they have an extremely short window to take advantage of the maximum discount.

With Bitcoin hovering around psychological price levels and Ethereum pushing its network updates to tackle scalability, the blockchain world keeps evolving. Amid this, the buzz surrounding emerging cryptos like Qubetics ($TICS) and the consistent performance of established ones like Tezos (XTZ) have taken centre stage. For those who feel they’ve missed out on earlier crypto booms, there’s good news. These tokens could be the best crypto to hold for long-term growth.

Tezos: The Veteran Blockchain with a Steady Rise Tezos (XTZ), known for its on-chain governance and energy efficiency, has maintained its reputation as a stable performer in the crypto space. Unlike many other blockchains that require hard forks to implement changes, Tezos upgrades itself seamlessly. This feature has drawn developers and users who value reliability. One of Tezos’s recent developments is its venture into the NFT space. With its energy-efficient proof-of-stake model, the platform has become a favorite among eco-conscious artists and creators. Major companies, including Red Bull Racing and Ubisoft, have adopted Tezos for their blockchain-based projects. Tezos’s current price is around $1.35, with a market cap of approximately $1.37 billion.

Whether it’s the ability to manage all your digital assets in one place or the option to spend your crypto like cash, the platform bridges the gap between blockchain and everyday life. This ease of use is what makes $TICS one of the best cryptos to hold for long-term growth. Experts project $TICS to reach $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering an 783% ROI. And that’s just the beginning. With a potential price of $5 post-presale and $15 after its mainnet launch, the earning potential is staggering. If you’re still wondering whether to take the plunge, remember that missing this opportunity could mean regretting it later. The Qubetics Wallet: Practical Solutions for Everyone Let’s break down how the Qubetics wallet could change the game for different users. Picture a corporate consultant travelling for work. Managing expenses across multiple currencies is a headache. With Qubetics, they could convert $TICS into stablecoins and pay directly using a virtual or debit card linked to their wallet. The instant crypto-to-stablecoin feature eliminates the stress of fluctuating exchange rates. The Qubetics marketplace could be revolutionary for real estate agents. Agents can tokenise properties and offer fractional ownership, making high-value assets accessible to everyday investors. It’s a win-win for buyers and sellers, and it’s all handled securely on the blockchain. Even students could benefit. Imagine receiving funds from parents overseas without hefty bank fees. Using the decentralized VPN feature, they could also protect their online activity while accessing study materials. The wallet’s user-friendly design ensures anyone can navigate it effortlessly.

Many investors wonder whether investing in new crypto projects is a smart decision. Well, investing in new cryptocurrencies offers a unique opportunity to get in early on potentially high-growth projects. So, just like an investment in early-stage companies in the stock market via IPOs, buying new cryptos can yield substantial returns if the project gains traction. New tokens often come with innovative ideas, fresh technologies, and exciting ecosystems that could become the next big thing in the crypto world. Remember that Bitcoin was also a new crypto not so long ago. In other words, the key reason why investors and people looking to start out in the crypto industry should invest in new cryptocurrencies is that new cryptocurrencies often offer higher growth potential, especially in a rising market like now. However, you should also remember that investing in new cryptos also comes with risks, as many of these projects are still in their infancy, and the volatility of the crypto market means prices can fluctuate dramatically. It is also crucial to conduct thorough research, understand the project's goals, and evaluate the team behind it before making a purchase. Nonetheless, for those willing to take the risk, new cryptos can certainly provide significant rewards. Key Factors to Check Before Buying a New Crypto Here are some key factors you should consider and check before buying a new cryptocurrency; Whitepaper One of the key factors an investor should check before buying a new crypto is its whitepaper. It is important to check and carefully read the whitepaper as it provides detailed information about the project’s goals, technology, and tokenomics. This will help you understand how the token works, its long-term vision, and if it aligns with your investment goals. Roadmap Another important factor to check and consider is the project's roadmap, as a well-defined roadmap shows the project's planned milestones and timeline for development. A roadmap essentially outlines planned milestones, development phases, and timelines, providing insight into the project's vision and execution strategy. So, by reviewing the roadmap, you can evaluate whether the goals are realistic and achievable within the proposed time frame, which can help you gauge whether the project is likely to succeed or face delays. The Team Before buying and investing in a new crypto, it is important to research the team behind the project. Needless to say, the team's expertise and credibility are critical indicators of the project's potential success, particularly when analyzing digital asset projects. So, it is important to investigate the founders, developers, and advisors to ensure they have relevant experience in blockchain technology, finance, or business development. A proven track record, especially in prior successful crypto or tech ventures, demonstrates competence and reliability. Community Engagement Another key factor to check is community engagement, as it is a key indicator of a project's strength. Before you invest, it is important to check the project's activity on social media platforms like Twitter, Discord, and Telegram to see if the community is active and supportive. Look for regular updates from the team, meaningful discussions, and enthusiasm among followers. A vibrant and engaged community not only helps promote the project but also provides valuable insights into its progress and potential challenges. Read Reviews Online Lastly, before investing in a cryptocurrency, reading reviews online is essential to gauge its credibility and potential. It is in your best interest to look out for feedback on forums, social media, and review platforms from both experts and the community. This is because reviews can reveal crucial insights about the project's team, utility, and overall sentiment, helping you identify red flags or strong opportunities. Conclusion - What Are The Best Cryptocurrencies To Buy Right Now? In sum, as Bitcoin sets to break $100K, these six new cryptos mentioned in this guide offer diverse opportunities for both seasoned investors and those looking to taste the cryptocurrency waters.

After operating since 1988, Enron went bankrupt in 2001 due to massive accounting fraud. The company concealed billions of dollars in debt, using Arthur Andersen, its accounting firm, to deceive shareholders and directors. Bankruptcy filings revealed about $74 billion in debt, marking the largest fraud scheme in U.S. history at the time. Enron’s business assets, including Prisma Energy, were sold in 2006, and the entity was renamed Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation in 2007. John J. Ray III, who was involved in the firm’s bankruptcy reorganization, would eventually join the beleaguered crypto exchange FTX in 2022 as an administrator. The bankruptcy veteran succeeded FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried as CEO and led a $16 billion recovery sprint for the FTX estate. FTX plans to repay creditors starting in early 2025.

With a significant price surge of over 420% in the last 30 days, XRP has outperformed major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), and others. XRP Outperformed SOL, BNB, and USDT Additionally, the altcoin has surpassed SOL, BNB, and USDT, becoming the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Source: Coinmarketcap However, current data suggests a negative outlook for XRP, indicating a potential price correction or a possible decline in the coming days. XRP’s $445M Inflow, What it Means for Investor? Data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass indicates that whales appear to be offloading their holdings as prices continue to rise. According to Coinglass’s XRP spot inflow/outflow data, exchanges have witnessed significant inflows of $444.39 million over the past four days. Source: Coinglass In the context of cryptocurrency, inflows refer to the movement of assets from whale wallets to exchanges, which often creates selling pressure and suggests that investors might be depositing the asset with the intent to sell. Rising Open Interest Besides whales and investors’ recent activity, traders have also shown strong interest in the altcoin, as reported by Coinglass’s open interest metrics. According to the data, XRP’s open interest (OI) has surged by 37.98% in the past 24 hours and 21% in the past four hours. This growing OI indicates heightened trader interest, leading to a significant increase in open positions. The combination of these on-chain metrics suggests that whales and traders are significantly participating in the altcoin as it continues to rise, potentially due to profit booking or the creation of short positions in the hope that the price may reverse. XRP’s Current Price Momentum At press time, XRP is trading near $2.72 and has registered a significant 43% upside momentum in the past 24 hours. This notable upside momentum is the highest by top cryptocurrencies on coinmarketcap. Meanwhile, during the same period, XRP has also witnessed a significant 390% rise in the trading volume, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day.",NEUTRAL,SOL | XRP | BNB,BUSINESS | SOL | TRADING | XRP | BNB,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/time-to-sell-xrp-444-million-inflows-on-exchanges/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Here’s When You Should Be Expecting It","Considering Bitcoin’s steady bullish momentum following Donald Trump’s win in the US Presidential elections, a crypto analyst believes that continuing this upward trend could see the Bitcoin price hit $245,000 this cycle. The analyst has provided the timeline for this mega price leap, utilizing logarithmic chart patterns and historical data to back his optimistic projection . When Bitcoin Price Will Hit $245,000 TradingView crypto analyst Behdark has released a report that provides a technical overview of the recent Bitcoin price trends and potential future movements . This detailed analysis is based on a two-week (2W) time frame on a chart that presents complete data on the Bitcoin price action . Looking at the Bitcoin chart, Behdark highlighted that the pioneer cryptocurrency was moving within a valid price channel, where the midline and resistance trend lines of the channel are drawn from previous highs. These trendlines point to a potential price target between $245,000 and $250,000 by 2025. The analyst acknowledged that he had previously set a medium—to long-term price target of $169,000 for Bitcoin, but has modified his projection to $245,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $95,107, marking a slight 2.18% decline in the last 24 hours. If the cryptocurrency increases to $245,000, it would represent a massive 157% price surge from its current value. Behdark’s optimistic projections of Bitcoin are based on analysis from logarithmic charts and price channels, which are particularly useful in analysing cryptocurrencies. These charts help identify sustainable market trends for a cryptocurrency over medium—to long-term periods. Moving forward, the analyst revealed that Bitcoin has successfully broken and surpassed critical resistance levels between the $77,000 and $78,000 range, indicating a shift in market sentiment . This previous resistance range has now transitioned into a price floor, which will act as a support level for Bitcoin. If Bitcoin’s price drops , Behdark has revealed that the cryptocurrency will likely retest this broken resistance level. Moreover, the Bitcoin price action is exhibiting a Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) gap of around $77,000, which, if filled, could reinforce bullish sentiment and reactivate Bitcoin’s upward momentum. Trump Presidency To Influence Crypto Market In his Bitcoin price analysis, Behdark also indicated that a Trump presidency could significantly influence Bitcoin’s future trajectory. The analyst noted that Trump’s support for cryptocurrencies and his upcoming four-year Presidential regime could have a favorable impact on the crypto market. Behdark believes that favorable political conditions could boost the adoption of cryptocurrencies and significantly trigger a sharp increase in the market capitalization of digital assets like Bitcoin. He further suggested that there would be considerable profit-making, but investors should be mindful and patient regarding risk management during his bull cycle.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-at-245000/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Buying crypto with fiat currency, especially the first time, can be a lengthy process, going back and forth with exchanges and enduring long KYC (know-your-customer) checks. The Apple Pay integration is supposed to make that process quicker, because the service is widely used among consumers, included by default on the tech giant's devices.    Introduced in 2014, Apple Pay has now roughly 500 million active users, and in the U.S. it holds over 90% of the market share for contactless payments.    “What on-ramp products do, in general, is they allow you to bring fiat into crypto. And historically, this has been a painful process,” said Nemil Dalal, the head of Coinbase’s developer platform, in an interview with CoinDesk. “With Onramp, the idea is that in a matter of seconds, with a familiar wallet experience that 60 million Americans are already used to using Apple Pay, you can hook up your bank account, move money on-chain, and then go do whatever you want.""  According to Dalal, you can already buy crypto on Uniswap via Coinbase Onramp. A draft blog post from Coinbase mentions Moonshot, an app for buying memecoins like dogwifhat and Iggy Azalea's MOTHER, that now takes cash deposits through Apple Pay.  The Onramp team uses certain data associated with the user's payment card that it receives via its Apple Pay integration to run Coinbase's own KYC procedures, sparing the consumer from having to manually provide that information to Coinbase.  As part of the integration, users who buy the USDC stablecoin with Apple Pay through Coinbase Onramp will not have to pay any transaction fees.

37141092,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373099,1733158470,How US Political Dynamics Led to the Downfall of Facebook’s Crypto Project,"David Marcus, the former head of Facebook’s blockchain project Libra, recently shared how political opposition led to the ambitious initiative’s downfall. In a detailed post on X, Marcus called the project’s failure “100% a political kill,” pointing to actions by government officials that effectively stopped it. ‘A Political Kill’ Libra, later rebranded as Diem, was launched by Facebook in 2019. The platform was designed to be a fast, payments-focused blockchain paired with a stablecoin to solve global payment challenges. Before announcing the project, Marcus and his team spent months briefing regulators in the U.S. and abroad. However, just two weeks later, Marcus was called to testify before the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee. This began two years of efforts to address lawmakers’ concerns. By spring 2021, Libra’s team had addressed every major regulatory concern, including issues related to financial crime, consumer protection, and reserve management. A limited pilot rollout was planned, with some members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors expressing support. However, according to Marcus, the project hit a critical roadblock during a biweekly meeting between Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. He alleged that Yellen advised Powell that supporting Libra would be “political suicide.” Shortly after, the Federal Reserve contacted banks involved in the project, warning them against moving forward. According to the former lead, this indirect pressure effectively ended the initiative. He explained that the project wasn’t stopped for legal or regulatory reasons but was entirely a political decision enforced by pressuring dependent banking institutions. For Marcus, the political nature of the project’s demise was the hardest part to accept. “America, this country I immigrated to… behaved in such a way for political reasons,” he wrote. Lessons and Broader Context Libra faced strong opposition globally, with financial leaders calling it a threat to national sovereignty. France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, openly criticized the idea of private companies creating cryptocurrencies, insisting monetary power should stay with governments. In the U.S., lawmakers were also skeptical, and Mark Zuckerberg was grilled for six hours by Congress over the project at the time. The broader regulatory environment also worked against the initiative. A November 2021 report on stablecoin regulation warned that combining a stablecoin issuer with a major commercial firm could lead to excessive economic power concentration. Reflecting on the events, Marcus highlighted key lessons from the experience. He concluded that building a truly global financial system requires a neutral, decentralized network like Bitcoin, which he believes is better suited for long-term success. Following its collapse, many former team members joined other blockchain projects like Aptos and Sui, which use technology developed for Libra. Marcus himself launched Lightspark, a startup focused on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network.

Analysis and predictions,"XRP’s price is on fire, surging 350% in 2024 — what’s fueling this rally, and could it be setting the stage to surpass Ethereum? Table of Contents XRP soars to a 6-year high Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin nears launch Whales, wallets, and ETFs XRP price predictions: how high could it go? XRP soars to a 6-year high Ripple ( XRP ) has been riding a massive bullish wave , with the price of XRP surging to an incredible 6-year high of $2.71 on Dec. 2, up from just $0.61 at the start of the year, reflecting nearly 350% gains for early 2024 investors. This bullish momentum has led XRP to dethrone Tether ( USDT ) as the third-largest crypto by market cap, with XRP currently sitting at a market cap of $154 billion compared to Tether’s $134 billion. Even with a slight retrace to $2.68 as of this writing, XRP has posted a remarkable 90% gain in just the past week, making it the second best-performing crypto among the top 100 coins by market cap. Ripple’s recent rally aligns with the election of Donald Trump as the 47th president of the U.S., the resignation of Gary Gensler as SEC chair, and a growing sense of optimism in the crypto community. Gensler’s departure marked the end of a regulatory era that many in the industry felt was overly combative, and Ripple, which has been embroiled in a long-standing legal battle with the SEC, seems to be emerging as a major beneficiary of this shifting dynamic. But that’s not all. According to data from CoinGlass, XRP experienced $85.5 million in future contract liquidations in the past 24 hours, outpacing even Bitcoin’s nearly $73 million. Interestingly, about $55 million of these liquidations were shorts — bets that XRP’s price would fall. Liquidations occur when traders betting on price movements (either up or down) can no longer maintain their positions due to market shifts, and the fact that so many short positions were wiped out indicates a strong bullish sentiment as prices rose dramatically, forcing these traders to exit their positions at a loss. Adding more fuel to the fire, according to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, Coinbase has played a key role in driving XRP’s rally, noting that over the last 30 days, Coinbase has shown a price premium on XRP ranging from 3% to 13%. Coinbase whales are driving this $XRP rally. Over the past 30 days, Coinbase's minute-level price premium has ranged from 3% to 13% during the surge. Meanwhile, Upbit—a Korean exchange with more XRP investors than Binance—has shown no significant premium so far. pic.twitter.com/ENESB2Zrkv — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 2, 2024 A premium like this means XRP is trading higher on Coinbase than on other exchanges, signalling strong demand from U.S.-based institutional and retail investors. Meanwhile, Korean exchange Upbit, which boasts a colossal XRP investor base, has shown no comparable premium, hinting that the rally might be more U.S.-driven for now. With so much happening around Ripple, where is XRP heading next? Let’s dive deeper into the data, analyze the market sentiment, and explore what this means for Ripple’s price predictions in the coming days. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin nears launch Ripple’s long-awaited stablecoin, RLUSD , appears to be on the verge of becoming a reality with reports suggesting that New York’s Department of Financial Services is close to granting its approval. According to Fox Business, Ripple is preparing for a potential launch as early as Dec. 4. If this happens, it will mark a crucial moment for the company, positioning RLUSD as a direct competitor to established stablecoins like USDC and USDT. Stablecoins, by design, are pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, offering the predictability of traditional money combined with the flexibility of blockchain technology. RLUSD would enable Ripple to provide a stable alternative for users seeking the benefits of digital assets without the price volatility associated with XRP or other cryptocurrencies. Adding fuel to the buzz are rumours that Ripple might use its massive XRP escrow holdings to establish the initial reserves for RLUSD. https://twitter.com/DelCrxpto/status/1863405589230957052 Ripple currently holds billions of XRP in escrow, periodically released to manage liquidity and fund operations. If the company chooses to lock up a large portion of this escrow to back RLUSD, it could have several noteworthy effects. First, it would provide substantial collateral for the stablecoin, reinforcing trust in its value. Second, it could reduce the circulating supply of XRP, creating scarcity that might drive price appreciation. Lastly, this approach would enhance the liquidity of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), further increasing its appeal to developers and institutional partners. Meanwhile, regulatory approval from the NYDFS would also give RLUSD a strong edge. In an environment where stablecoins face constant scrutiny, receiving the green light from one of the most respected financial regulators could make RLUSD an attractive option for risk-averse businesses and institutions. Whales, wallets, and ETFs Ripple’s resurgence isn’t confined to its soaring XRP price or the anticipated launch of its RLUSD stablecoin. A standout trend driving this momentum is the large accumulation of XRP by large investors. According to Santiment, wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP have amassed an additional 679.1 million tokens in just three weeks — a haul currently valued at $1.83 billion — hinting that traders are likely betting on further growth in XRP’s value or utility. https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1863481287559819656 Adding to the buzz is the record-breaking rise in XRP wallet activity. For the first time in Ripple’s history, the number of non-empty XRP wallets has surpassed 5.5 million. With more users and institutions engaging with XRP, whether for trading, payments, or leveraging the XRPL for decentralized applications – adoption is growing. Ripple’s influence is also growing within traditional finance, fueled by increasing interest in XRP-focused investment products. WisdomTree, a leading asset management firm, has filed an application with the SEC to launch an XRP spot exchange-traded fund. https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1863559841341485547 WisdomTree’s filing joins a wave of similar applications from firms like Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Funds, signalling a strong push for regulated XRP financial products. If launched, an XRP spot ETF, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF , would allow investors to gain exposure to XRP without directly owning it, lowering the barrier to entry for traditional financial players. XRP price predictions: how high could it go? XRP has been riding a strong bullish wave in the last few weeks, but the big question now is: where could the price go from here? While XRP is currently sitting at $2.68, it still trades about 30% below its all-time high of $3.84, achieved in January 2018. Notable crypto analyst Dark Defender has identified a Fibonacci-based target of $5.85, marking it as a key level in XRP’s multi-wave price structure. Hey there. I hope you all are fine!

Dark Defender’s roadmap even charts a long-term target of $18.22, an ambitious projection from current price levels. Similarly, analyst Javon Marks shares a bullish outlook, pointing out that XRP’s recent break above the $2.47 resistance level has set the stage for a climb toward $4.80. He suggests that sustaining a hold above $2.47 could pave the way for further upward momentum. https://twitter.com/JavonTM1/status/1863392390133764574 Meanwhile, renowned trader Peter Brandt has offered a strikingly audacious projection, suggesting XRP could reach as high as $24 based on his technical analysis. pic.twitter.com/1kuFxoWxM0 — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 1, 2024 While Brandt hasn’t attached a timeline to this target, his forecast hinges on XRP’s liquidity, adoption, and sentiment—factors that, under the right conditions, can drive exponential price movements. While these forecasts spark excitement, it’s crucial to approach them with caution. XRP’s recent rally has been powered by a mix of technical breakouts, whale accumulation, and positive sentiment, but the unpredictable nature of markets remains a key factor. Macroeconomic challenges such as rising interest rates, economic uncertainty, or potential regulatory setbacks could temper market enthusiasm.

Between November 25 and December 1, the company acquired an additional 15,400 BTC. This Bitcoin acquisition was purchased at an average price of $95,976 per coin, totaling a staggering $1.5 billion. This latest purchase underscores MicroStrategy’s unyielding commitment to Bitcoin as its central asset strategy. This development was detailed in an 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today. MicroStrategy Bet Big on Bitcoin with Bold Equity Moves This latest acquisition coincides with the sale of 3,728,507 MicroStrategy shares, raising $1.5 billion in the same timeframe. These transactions form part of the company’s ambitious plan to sell up to $21 billion in equity and an equal amount in fixed-income securities. Together, these moves aim to secure $42 billion over the next three years, mainly for buying more Bitcoin. Despite its aggressive share issuance, MicroStrategy revealed that approximately $11.3 billion in equity is still available for sale. This dual strategy of share dilution and strategic accumulation reflects the firm’s confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. MicroStrategy’s Reserve: A Mammoth Treasury of Digital Gold As of December 1, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings stand at an impressive 402,100 BTC, valued at over $38 billion. The company’s cumulative acquisition cost, including fees and expenses, sits at about $23.4 billion. This translates to an average price of $58,263 per Bitcoin. This positions MicroStrategy as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, far surpassing other listed public companies. This latest purchase is part of a relentless acquisition streak. Over the past month, the company made headlines with a record-breaking purchase of 55,500 BTC for $5.4 billion. Following the acquisition of $4.6 billion worth of Bitcoin the prior week. These purchases reflect an aggressive scaling strategy that few companies could rival. To gauge its performance and justify its strategy to shareholders, MicroStrategy employs a proprietary metric called Bitcoin Yield.This measures the percentage change in Bitcoin holdings relative to the company’s diluted shares. As of December 1, MicroStrategy reported a year-to-date Bitcoin Yield of 63.3%. This showcases its ability to balance the dilution impact of share sales with robust growth in its Bitcoin reserves. Saylor’s Pushes for Widespread Bitcoin Adoption Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s co-founder and executive chairman, has not confined his Bitcoin advocacy to his own company. Saylor urged Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella, and its board to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset. He boldly predicted that doing so could drive the company’s assets to skyrocket to $5 trillion. Recently, he made a bold call for 60 public companies to issue equity to buy Bitcoin . Saylor’s bold stance highlights his belief in Bitcoin as a revolutionary financial tool. He sees it as unmatched in preserving value and driving growth.

Here’s an Analyst’s View","Bitcoin started the week on a downward note, dropping nearly 2% to around $95,000 before recovering. BTC has been hovering between $90,000 and $98,000 for the past two weeks, struggling with persistent resistance at the psychological $100,000 level. Valentin Fournier, an analyst at BRN, noted the significant hurdles preventing Bitcoin from surpassing this milestone. “Despite strong market catalysts and rising investor confidence, Bitcoin continues to struggle with the psychological barrier of $100,000,” Fournier wrote in an email. “Profit taking is evident and a significant sell wall of over 4,000 Bitcoins worth approximately $384 million needs to be cleared for further highs to be reached.” Broader macroeconomic conditions, particularly Fed rate expectations, are also weighing on Bitcoin. Recent data suggests a shift in investor sentiment around the Fed’s next moves. The CME FedWatch tool shows the probability of a 25 basis point rate cut at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Dec. 18 has dropped to 61% from 67% last Friday. This week, investors are keeping a close eye on critical economic reports and Fed officials’ speeches that could impact Bitcoin’s price trajectory.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP hits a 3-year high amid Ripple’s wins and SEC shifts. Cardano holds strong as Yeti Ouro leads viral meme coin buzz. Table of Contents XRP price prediction: The year of XRP Cardano price stays above $1 as investors flock to Yeti Ouro Between Ripple winning in its case against the SEC, the resignation of Gary Gensler from the agency and XRP reawakening and hitting a three-year high, it has been a magnificent year for XRP. The token is expected to surge even higher as Ripple expands its blockchain innovations. Meanwhile, Cardano is holding strong above $1, as new viral meme coin Yeti Ouro (YETIO) dominates the market. XRP price prediction: The year of XRP Since 2021, XRP has failed to impress in the subsequent bull rallies, falling behind its rivals and peers like Ethereum, Solana and Bitcoin , which it once competed with as a top-five crypto five years ago. It has long been criticized by many, with Forbes dubbing it a ‘multi-billion dollar zombie chain.’ Its multi-year court battle with the SEC hasn’t helped its course, with institutional investors staying away and some platforms delisting it in that time. Then came the US elections, and as the crypto market started to rise after Donald Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris, XRP emerged as one of the major driving forces behind the rally. In November, the altcoin gained 250%, making it its best monthly performance since the 2018 bull rally when it surged to its ATH of $3.84. One of the significant boosts for XRP has been Ripple’s strides on the legal and tech fronts. The California blockchain payments firm, which spearheads the development of the XRP ecosystem, has notched major victories this year, none more so than its legal victory over the SEC. While the agency was pushing for a $2 billion settlement for alleged securities law violations, the court opted for a $125 million fine, which in the crypto sector is a mere slap on the wrist as some, like Binance and Genesis, have paid $4.3 billion and $2 billion in fines, respectively. You might also like: AVAX to surge, SOL reaches 3-year high, as whales flock to Yeti Ouro for 20% bonus Cardano price stays above $1 as investors flock to Yeti Ouro Cardano is the other sleeping giant that has awoken in November, tripling its price in the last 30 days. This bull run enabled ADA to hit the $1 mark for the first time since March 2022. Technical indicators show that despite hitting the milestone, ADA could be positioned for even higher gains. The next target for the token is $2.453, which would correspond with its 1.618 Fibonacci level. After this, the next target would be $8.30, its 2.618 Fibonacci level. If ADA hits this target, it would have gained 670% from its current price, making it one of the best investments in crypto. However, investors have identified Yeti Ouro as an even better investment and are flocking to the new viral meme coin’s ongoing presale. This presale has seen investors scoop up 66 million YETIO tokens, raising $840,000 for the project. Yeti Ouro is offering a 20% Cyber Monday bonus, further incentivizing investors. Yeti Ouro is based around Yeti Go, a new play-to-earn game that rewards players with YETIO tokens for winning their races. Players must dodge obstacles along the race track while also attacking fellow players and fending off their attacks to give themselves an edge. Yeti Ouro has focused on giving YETIO utility, setting it apart from most meme coins. The token’s supply is also capped at one billion tokens, and 5% is allocated to the token-burning mechanism, making the token deflationary.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE.

Hedera Hashgraph ( HBAR ), a top layer-1 network, jumped to a high of $0.2847, up by over 582% from its lowest point this month. The coin jumped as data showed that more HBAR tokens were leaving crypto exchanges. In most cases, token outflows from exchanges is one of the best indicators that investors are accumulating the token. In an X post, Shawn, a popular analyst, noted that there would be “very little HBAR [is] left to buy on exchanges.” https://twitter.com/oroogle/status/1863438993230090492 Another analyst noted that the HBAR price was rising as interest for the coin continued rising. He identified Google Trends data, which showed that more people were searching for HBAR. In most periods, an increase in Google search queries is usually a sign of traders embracing a fear of missing out. Another possible reason why Hedera Hashgraph price is rising is that Donald Trump is considering his pick for the next Securities and Exchange Commission chair. While Paul Atkins is a leading contender, Brian Brooks, a Board member of Hashgraph, has been named. Data by Kalshi shows that Brooks has a 21% chance of being named. Meanwhile, Hedera Hashgraph has soared after Canary Capital filed for a spot HBAR ETF . Analysts expect the SEC to approve many of these funds since Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs have done well this year. You might also like: How CrytocoinMiner makes cloud mining accessible and profitable Hedera Hashgraph has strong technicals HBAR price chart | source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that the HBAR token price formed a double-bottom pattern at $0.037, which also explains why it has surged. This pattern happened between January 2023 and November this year. Normally, a consolidation that forms for a long time tends to have a strong move. The coin has now moved above the key resistance level at $0.1796, its highest swing on April 2022. It has also jumped to the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level. The coin has also jumped above the 50-week Exponential Moving Average. Hedera Hashgraph’s Relative Strength Index and the Stochastic Oscillator have moved to the overbought levels. Therefore, there are signs that the Hedera Hashgraph price will continue rising as bulls target the next point at $0.5690, its highest point on record.

It’s the beginning of December, and with a few promising coins, you could make some impressive gains before Christmas rolls around. Plus, those profits could actually keep snowballing and roll right into 2025. Choise.ai – $CHO Among the tokens being discussed right now, $CHO is one of the biggest names, and for plenty of reasons. $CHO has grown 111.8% in 14 days, outpacing Bitcoin’s 40% and Ethereum’s 47% in the same period. When you stack up $CHO’s growth against the two biggest names in crypto, it’s definitely keeping up – and in some way, outperforming. $CHO, which got listed on BingX in April 2024, is at the core of the Choise.ai ecosystem. It includes Choise.com , a crypto platform with over a million users in 170+ countries, Vault , a B2B white-label crypto banking solution, and multiple exciting solutions that are currently being developed, Entropy (which was covered in more detail earlier), PerpeX , the Tringlr technology, and more. By the way, Choise.ai just launched the “ Ready, Set, Go ” program with up to $21M in rewards for $CHO holders, plus a weekly lottery with up to $500K in prizes and shared an announcement hinting that something new is cooking , and it’s set to drop in 2 days . All the big announcements made by the Choise.ai team February to April this year resulted in a huge 700% price increase for $CHO. It looks like some well-known crypto figures are just as excited about these updates as the $CHO community is. For example, Mercek, who made a name for himself in the 2021 NFT boom and has never been shy about sharing his thoughts on crypto tokens, discussing $CHO and its potential definitely carries some weight. Image source: X Alex Clay, whose predictions and technical analysis seem to hit the mark based on the comments on his posts, is also one of those giving a shoutout to a bullish reversal for $CHO. Image source: X It's always a good idea to check out sentiment on other platforms besides X, like CoinMarketCap. One post there is getting a lot of attention, with a trader not only predicting an upside for $CHO based on the indicators but also on the hints the team has been giving about something new on the horizon. Image source: CoinMarketCap Looking at the $CHO chart, the RSI is sitting at a strong 63, indicating healthy bullish momentum – it’s coming down slightly from a recent high of 69, which suggests a minor cooldown but still plenty of strength to push higher. The MACD line at 0.00238 is holding above the signal line at 0.00226, with a positive histogram showing consistent upward momentum. Watch for the RSI to stay above 60 (that’s a good sign the momentum is still strong). Source: TradingView 2. Dogecoin – $DOGE When Elon Musk speaks, the markets always react. $DOGE got a nice bump after Musk’s chat on The Joe Rogan Experience. This followed Musk being actually picked by President Donald Trump to lead the real Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), working alongside Vivek Ramaswamy. Their goal is to cut red tape, ditch pointless regulations, and shake up how federal agencies work. Combining the lighthearted charm of meme coins with the real-world value of utility tokens, $DOGE proves that some coins have both fun and purpose in one package. Its recent price jump might not hit the same highs as $CHO’s wild triple-digit rally, but it’s clear $DOGE still has plenty of room to grow in 2025. What’s more, $DOGE has stepped out of its meme roots and into the real world, with high trading volumes and the ability to pay for Tesla products. The community’s support is turning DOGE into a token with growing utility right now. Source: TradingView $DOGE is hovering around $0.421, showing a slight dip, but it seems to be holding steady above key support levels. The RSI is sitting near the lower end, around 40, which indicates that DOGE might be oversold and could have room to bounce back up. The MACD lines are close to converging, suggesting momentum might shift upwards soon. If we see the price reclaim $0.450, it could spark renewed buying interest. It’s not explosive yet, but it’s definitely setting up for a potential recovery. 3. Sentinel – $DVPN With privacy becoming a bigger issue every day, a decentralized VPN could be just what people are looking for to keep their data safe and their profits up. Sentinel ($DVPN) runs on the Cosmos network and sets itself apart with a cool peer-to-peer bandwidth marketplace. Launched in 2018, $DVPN saw its big moment during the 2021 bull run, reaching an all-time high of $0.05066, but like many others, it cooled off afterward. However, with privacy becoming more of a hot topic again, and the crypto space heating up, it could be gearing up for another push. Technical indicators back up this assumption. Source: TradingView The RSI is at 60, still below the overbought zone (70), suggesting there's room for more upside. The MACD is showing a strong bullish crossover with the blue line (MACD) above the orange signal line, and the histogram bars are growing, signaling increasing buying pressure. The price is also above key support levels, with recent moves breaking resistance at around 0.00112, which adds to the bullish sentiment. Volume is solid too, with 21.93M traded, further confirming the upward momentum. One more thing that sets Sentinel apart is its community-driven model. Instead of trusting a centralized VPN provider, users can buy and sell bandwidth directly with one another. No single entity controls your data – it's all about decentralization. Along with its dVPN, Sentinel also offers a security layer through its protocol (UPP), which protects users from hacks, scams, and fraud. 4. Hivemapper – $HONEY People are talking about DePIN projects now – they’re all about using decentralized tech to change things like the internet and mapping for the better, and allow them to contribute data and get some real cash in return. Hivemapper is a DePIN project that's basically a Web3 version of Google Maps powered by AI. Hivemapper takes a fresh approach – buy their dashcam, drive around, and earn $HONEY tokens while mapping roads. The token price has already seen a nice pump, but the market cap is still pretty low, meaning there's plenty of upside. Looking at the chart, $HONEY has definitely had a strong pump, with the price spiking recently. The RSI is sitting at 83, indicating it's in overbought territory, signaling that a cooldown might be coming soon. However, the MACD is still bullish, with the blue line (MACD) above the orange line (signal), and the histogram is showing positive momentum, which suggests the buying pressure is still strong for now. This creates a potentially interesting scenario: while the token has pumped, the strong MACD signal could mean that the price might consolidate before making another move up. If the RSI cools off, it could be a solid chance to grab some $HONEY for the long haul, especially with the long-term forecast, the one for 2025, looking pretty bullish. Source: TradingView The “drive to earn” and DePIN models have the potential to generate huge amounts in revenue, and now might be just the right time to get into these, or into $HONEY. 5. Veloce – $VEXT When it comes to racing and gaming, Veloce Media Group is doing it all – successful teams, great content, talented management, and unique products. Now, they’ve brought out $VEXT, their native token, to tie everything together and make the fan experience more interactive. What’s $VEXT all about? It powers their digital racing network and brings a bunch of perks. Think in-game upgrades, voting on decisions, access to events, and more ways to feel like part of the action. It’s not just for gamers either – it’s about connecting fans with the things they love in a new way. Veloce is taking fandom up a notch, giving loyal supporters something back while adding real value across their gaming and racing world. It feels like they’re bridging the gap between fans and the action, and $VEXT might just be the start of something big. Beyond the story, what do technical indicators have to say about where $VEXT might be going? Source: TradingView Looking at the chart, $VEXT is showing strong momentum. The RSI is sitting at 84, which indicates overbought conditions on the four-hour timeframe but also reflects strong buying pressure driving the rally. Looking at the MACD, the MACD line is at 0.008530, while the signal line lags at 0.004710, confirming strong bullish momentum. These are signs of bullish sentiment, but some cooling off might create a better entry point for those eyeing long-term profits with $VEXT. 6. Celer Network – $CELR Celer Network is all about making things easier when it comes to blockchain. It connects different blockchains, so people can access things like tokens, DeFi, GameFi, NFTs, and more, without having to deal with the mess of hopping between chains. Thanks to the $CELR token, which powers the whole thing, developers can build apps that work seamlessly across multiple blockchains. What’s cool about it is how it focuses on making liquidity more efficient while still keeping everything simple, almost like using just one chain even though it’s multi-chain behind the scenes. The $CELR token also stands out because of its state channel tech, which makes transactions faster and cheaper. It’s a good fit for payments, gaming, and other uses, and as the whole ecosystem grows, $CELR is likely to get more attention. Celer’s been busy building its ecosystem and collaborating with other projects, and it’s helping $CELR find its place, while the charts are looking pretty strong for what’s ahead. Source: TradingView Looking at the chart, the RSI is sitting near 50, which is a neutral zone but still healthy – it recently dropped from around 65, so there’s room for a bounce back if it stays above 40. On the MACD, the line is at 0.00067, just below the signal line at 0.00085, which shows a slight pullback, but the histogram is flat, hinting at a potential turnaround and suggesting $CELR could still push higher with the right momentum. Conclusion At the end of the day, it’s always good to dig a little deeper and try to find those hidden gems that could end up growing way more than just 2x or 3x. Sure, $DOGE, $VEXT, $CELR, $HONEY, $DVPN and $CHO all have huge potential, and they’re definitely worth keeping an eye on. But when it comes to everything that’s happening in the ecosystem, $CHO seems to be leading the charge. The constant buzz, new announcements, and regular updates from the team really make it really hard to ignore. Now everyone’s waiting to see what the next big reveal will be, and there’s a real feeling that the price could be on the brink of a serious jump any moment now.

42387455,122e70e7-ea7d-476c-9de6-f06ffa7bcfb1,1733156562,De-banking Deserves Urgent Attention,"Until last week, the issue of de-banking remained largely an open secret, something known primarily to insiders like myself. As I work to protect people and entities affected by de-banking both in the U.S. and globally, I have witnessed firsthand the devastating economic and social impact this has had on businesspeople, nonprofit organizations and “politically exposed persons.”    This situation changed as millions of people became familiar with the concept of de-banking after venture capitalist Marc Andreessen appeared on the Joe Rogan podcast. Andreessen discussed the exclusion of politically disfavored individuals and entities from the financial system, focusing specifically on the crypto-assets industry.    His remarks triggered a wave of responses, drawing attention to the broader issue of de-banking in the tech and cryptocurrency sectors. Prominent figures like the Winklevoss brothers, known for their contributions to cryptocurrency exchange development, voiced their frustrations. David Marcus, former leader of Facebook’s Libra/Diem project, commented on how the U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen allegedly pressured Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to dissuade banks from supporting the project (which was started by Facebook). Similarly, Nick Neuman, CEO of Casa, recounted his experience of being de-banked by Silicon Valley Bank. His company, which offers self-custodial services, faced rejection from nearly 50 banks before finally securing a partnership with one institution.    In her recently published memoir, former First Lady Melania Trump revealed that a bank abruptly terminated her long-standing financial relationship, and her son Barron was blocked from opening a new account at the same institution. While the bank’s name remains undisclosed, the incident highlights the arbitrary and opaque nature of such decisions.    People and entities are being “de-banked” at an alarming rate, meaning their access to financial services is being terminated either by direct political pressures, the weaponization of regulations, or simply as an unintended consequence of other regulations.    De-banking is economically isolating not only entrepreneurs in the crypto-assets sector but also a wide range of communities, including international businesses, humanitarian organizations, public individuals, human rights activists, businesses deemed as unethical, and legal immigrants.    I began working on this policy issue in the spring of 2023. While researching sanctions policy, I discovered that malicious political actors around the world were exploiting the financial system to repress their opponents, both domestically and globally. In Nicaragua, for example, activists like Felix Maradiaga have argued that the government has abused the financial system to terminate bank accounts and strip the assets of activists, non-profit organizations, and even the Church.    This understudies policy issue sparked my interest, prompting me to delve deeper into this completely understudied policy issue. I spoke with numerous dissidents in exile, human rights defenders, and businesspeople who had been targeted in this manner. They shared how their bank accounts were arbitrarily closed, assets frozen, and private financial information weaponized against them.    Malicious political and business actors de-bank people and entities by abusing Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CFT) regulations. For instance, they orchestrate targeted disinformation campaigns to falsely accuse individuals or organizations of money laundering or financing terrorism. Amplified through state-controlled media, these accusations feed into automated compliance systems used by financial institutions. Once flagged, the targeted accounts are often closed or denied access to services to avoid regulatory penalties — irrespective of the credibility of the claims. This has been the case of activists like Lyudmyla Kozlovska, President of the Open Dialogue Foundation.    Moreover, malicious political actors exploit the global trust placed in Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs), which serve as clearinghouses for financial data under AML/CFT frameworks. AML/CFT regulations require FIUs to exchange sensitive financial data with international counterparts to combat crime. However, in authoritarian regimes, FIUs often operate as tools of state repression, granting governments access to dissidents’ financial records, transaction histories, and personal details. This sensitive information is weaponized to intimidate, harass, and undermine critics both domestically and abroad.    De-banking and vulnerable groups  Beyond their deliberate weaponization, the misuse of AML/CFT laws frequently yields unintended consequences that disproportionately impact vulnerable groups, such as immigrants. Financial institutions in the U.S. often classify individuals from certain regions as “high risk,” as their countries of origin are labeled as “high-risk jurisdictions” by financial institutions. This classification triggers enhanced compliance measures, requiring additional documentation, background checks, and ongoing monitoring for these individuals to access financial services.  For immigrants, this creates barriers to entry into the financial system. Many face exorbitant costs and excessive scrutiny, discouraging financial institutions from onboarding them as clients. This “de-risking” practice, where banks terminate or deny services to perceived high-risk clients to minimize compliance burdens, often leaves immigrants without access to even basic banking services such as savings accounts or payment systems. Without these services, immigrants struggle to integrate into their host countries' economies, send remittances to their families, or establish credit histories, perpetuating cycles of financial and social exclusion.  The Need for Awareness and Action    The rise of de-banking as a political weapon is a wake-up call for all of us to act. Silence only perpetuates these injustices. If we do not act now, the financial system risks becoming a privilege reserved for the few — a battleground for partisan agendas — rather than a neutral platform designed to empower individuals, safeguard their savings, and facilitate economic activity.    We need to continue raising awareness about this crisis and fight for a “Right to Banking.” This right must transcend nationality, political beliefs, or economic status, ensuring that no one is arbitrarily excluded from participating in the global economy. Guaranteeing this access is not only an economic necessity but a moral imperative, foundational to modern citizenship and human dignity. We also ought to protect new financial solutions in the crypto-assets space, as they are key to advancing financial inclusion globally — thanks to their permissionless nature and decentralized structure.    To achieve this, we must demand structural reforms that address the flaws in AML/CFT regulations. These laws must include safeguards to prevent their misuse as tools for political repression or financial exclusion, as well as clear remedies for victims of debanking. Structural reforms are essential to ensure that neither autocratic politicians nor malicious private sector actors can weaponize the financial system.    Let’s work together, policymakers, industry leaders, and civil society, to build momentum for reforms that preserve the financial system’s integrity, including the protection of the crypto-assets sector. Together, we must ensure that the financial system (traditional and modern financial instruments) remains an inclusive and well-functioning pillar of our market economy.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Jorge Jraissati,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/02/de-banking-deserves-urgent-attention,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c4e7c0f9de506ae115915b2ba853e3592e607bbe-9000x6000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

37140875,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51201,1733155865,Ripple Locks Back $2.16 Billion Worth of XRP As Price Rallies to $3,"Ripple has recently locked back 800 million XRP worth $2.16 billion at current prices, as detailed in transaction records shared by XRP-based researcher Leonidas. These whopping tokens were initially unlocked on December 1, 2024. The transactions demonstrate Ripple’s practice of managing XRP’s circulating supply via periodic escrow releases, an approach central to the network’s economic model since 2017. However, the implications of such actions have sparked significant debate within the XRP community. 800M $XRP back into escrow in December pic.twitter.com/Yj6lhHRTLX — Leonidas (@LeoHadjiloizou) December 1, 2024 Key Details of the Escrow Transactions Ripple initiated the escrow of 800 million XRP across three transactions, temporarily locking these funds until future release dates. Of this total, 500 million XRP and 270 million XRP are set to be released on February 1, 2028, while the remaining 30 million XRP will become available on March 1, 2028. This move aligns with Ripple’s established monthly escrow strategy, ensuring predictability in managing XRP’s circulating supply. Community Reactions and Misconceptions The announcement ignited discussions among XRP enthusiasts on the market supply and demand impact. One community member speculated that this process could create a supply shock by withholding XRP from the market. The user suggested that institutions might face challenges acquiring XRP in such a scenario, potentially driving up demand and price. However, another member, Nellaiwala, countered this perspective with a more measured explanation. According to them, Ripple’s escrow mechanism does not introduce a supply shock but merely controls the flow of XRP entering circulation. They clarified that Ripple’s monthly escrow releases involve 1 billion XRP, of which a portion is often returned to escrow after use. In this case, 800 million XRP was locked back into escrow after 200 million XRP was added to circulation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Understanding Ripple’s Escrow Model Ripple’s escrow strategy was established in 2017 to ensure transparency and predictability in the release of XRP. The system locks up large amounts of XRP, releasing 1 billion coins every month over a predetermined schedule. Any unused XRP from the monthly release is relocked back into the escrow. This mechanism ensures Ripple retains control over its XRP holdings while gradually increasing the circulating supply. It is worth noting that the 800 million XRP locked in December was never truly part of the circulating supply, either before or after the transactions. Instead, these funds were reallocated within Ripple’s controlled supply framework. Supply vs. Circulation: The ATM Analogy To simplify, Nellaiwala provided a relatable analogy, comparing Ripple’s escrow system to withdrawing money from an ATM. Based on the analogy, like an ATM dispensing a fixed amount (e.g., $1,000) regardless of user needs, Ripple releases a standard amount of XRP each month. Any unused funds are returned to escrow, maintaining consistency in supply growth. Ripple’s escrow model helps manage XRP’s circulating supply and fosters long-term stability. While debates about its effects on market dynamics persist, the recent re-escrowing of 800 million XRP underscores the importance of understanding Ripple’s approach to supply management.

Between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1, MicroStrategy sold approximately 3.7 million shares, generating net proceeds of around $1.48 billion after deducting sales commissions. This sale is part of a broader plan under the sales agreement with various financial institutions, which allows for the issuance and sale of up to $21 billion worth of shares. As of Dec. 1, MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings stand at 402,100 BTC, acquired at an aggregate purchase price of roughly $23.4 Billion. This equates to an average price of $58,263 per Bitcoin, including associated fees and costs. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings and share dilution. Source: MicroStrategy The sales agreement, initiated on Oct. 30 with TD Securities (USA) LLC and other sales agents, has facilitated the sale of shares, leaving the company with approximately $11.3 billion worth of shares available for future transactions. 2025 Will Become the “Year of the Crypto Renaissance” MicroStrategy continues to actively accumulate Bitcoin. To fund these purchases, the company is strategically issuing shares to expand its cryptocurrency holdings. This strategy aligns with CEO Michael Saylor’s vocal support for Bitcoin, further solidifying MicroStrategy’s position as a leading institutional holder of the cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy calls Bitcoin as “the highest performing uncorrelated asset that a corporation can hold on its balance sheet” in its recent presentation about the company’s Bitcoin strategy. In the presentation, MicroStrategy predicts that 2025 will be the “year of the crypto renaissance.” This prediction is based on anticipated developments such as Wall Street’s embrace of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , widespread adoption of fair value accounting for digital assets, and a pro-Bitcoin stance from the next U.S. president and cabinet. Further supporting this “renaissance” are MicroStrategy’s expectations of growing congressional support for crypto, the establishment of a “Bitcoin Strategic Reserve” , and a clear regulatory framework for digital assets in the U.S. MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) is closely tied to Bitcoin’s performance, but with amplified swings. While Bitcoin is up 150% this year, MSTR has surged by 513%. This heightened volatility was clear in November when MSTR soared 58%, exceeding Bitcoin’s 37% gain for the month. $MSTR November 2024 Returns: +58.47% December will be very interesting to see how we close out this amazing quarter and year.

Holding $BEST grants users governance rights, meaning they get a say on all key decisions relating to the project’s future. Moreover, it provides trading fee discounts across the Best Wallet ecosystem and even gives higher staking rewards. The token also opens holders to exclusive advantages on partner projects. For instance, Best Wallet has partnered with four iGaming sites, where $BEST holders get free spins, deposit bonuses, and more. But prospective buyers should act quickly. The $BEST price will rise throughout the presale, with the next increase later today. Follow Best Wallet on X or join its Telegram for updates.

According to data from analytics platform IntoTheBlock, Litecoin’s ( LTC ) recent price surge has led to a significant increase in profitable holders. In mid-November, around 60% of LTC holders were in profit. By Dec. 2, that figure had risen to almost 80%, with the In/Out of the Money metric showing over 6.37 million Litecoin addresses—approximately 79.37%—now in profit. Over 60% of LTC holders are now in profit—the highest since April. Many of the holders still at a loss bought in 2021 and may sell as they break even. Could this create resistance, or will Litecoin push past and set new highs this cycle? pic.twitter.com/EY4iKrKss8 — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) November 18, 2024 You might also like: Here’s why Helium Mobile surged over 100% in 24 hours On Dec. 2, Litecoin’s price of $122.79 was up 19% in 24 hours and 28% in the past week. These gains, which have come as Bitcoin toyed with the coveted $100k and XRP exploded , add to nearly 78% in the last 30 days. Per IntoTheBlock, this upside momentum has elevated more than 6.37 million LTC addresses, or about 79.37% of holders, into profit. This is the highest percentage of Litecoin holders in profit since November 2021, when 75% of holders were in green as LTC reached $220. However, about 1.23 million addresses, or 15.36% of holders, remain “out of the money,” having purchased LTC at higher prices.

37141401,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103632,1733155271,Analyst Says Bitcoin May Keep Rising as BTC Crash Narratives Surge,"A market veteran has maintained his bullish Bitcoin stance despite prevalent bearish sentiments but identifies key levels that could invalidate his bullish outlook. Bitcoin’s recent price movements have triggered divided opinions among market analysts, as it has failed to claim the historic $100,000. With BTC now below $97,000, some experts predict a significant downturn, while others remain optimistic about growth potential. Ali Martinez, a prominent crypto market analyst, shared his view in a thread on X. Despite the growing narrative of an impending Bitcoin crash, Martinez maintains a bullish outlook. However, he outlined key levels that could challenge his optimism. Diverging Bitcoin Predictions Martinez highlighted the contrasting views among analysts regarding Bitcoin’s future. Some, like Sheldon the Sniper, foresee a bearish scenario. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1863526630867550502Sheldon predicts a potential sharp liquidation event that could push Bitcoin below $90,000 . He attributes this forecast to recent bearish weekly candle closures, which he believes signal an imminent downturn. Robert Kiyosaki, the author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” also expressed concerns about a Bitcoin price correction yesterday. He suggested that Bitcoin could drop to $60,000 before rebounding. Nonetheless, Kiyosaki emphasized that such a crash would be a “buying opportunity,” as he maintains belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential to reach $250,000 by 2025. Moreover, while Tom Lee, Fundstrat’s head of research, projects Bitcoin’s value to climb to $250,000 within two years, other analysts within the firm anticipate a short-term dip to $60,000 before any significant recovery. Martinez’s Bullish Perspective In contrast to the bearish outlook, Martinez remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential for further gains. He pointed out that social media mentions of a possible Bitcoin pullback have surged, as reported by Santiment. Historically, Bitcoin tends to defy crowd expectations, often rallying when fear dominates sentiment. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1863526639121859026Martinez compared the current cycle to previous ones in 2017 and 2020, noting striking similarities. If this holds, Bitcoin could surge to $120,000–$150,000 before experiencing a significant 30% correction. He identified $135,000 and $159,000 as potential resistance levels where Bitcoin might encounter its first major pullback. BTC Support Levels to Watch Despite his bullish stance, Martinez identified two important support levels that could invalidate his optimism if breached. The first key level is $93,580, where approximately 667,000 wallets collectively hold over 504,000 BTC. A drop below this level could trigger selling pressure from these holders. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1863526643253367229The second crucial level is $90,520. If Bitcoin fails to maintain support at this zone, Martinez believes a more pronounced correction could ensue. However, the market analyst expects this development to provide a buying opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on lower prices. Currently, BTC trades for $96,765 at press time, down 0.56% in the last 24 hours.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/02/analyst-says-bitcoin-may-keep-rising-as-btc-crash-narratives-surge/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-says-bitcoin-may-keep-rising-as-btc-crash-narratives-surge,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Analysts predict it could achieve over 5,000% growth in the coming months. This emerging token might surpass established names like TRX and Solana, capturing the attention of investors seeking the next big opportunity. CYBRO Presale Exceeds $5.5 Million: A One-in-a-Million Multichain Next GEN DeFi Investment Opportunity CYBRO is capturing the attention of crypto whales as its exclusive token presale quickly surges above $5.5 million. This next-generation DeFi platform offers investors unparalleled opportunities to enhance crypto earnings across multiple blockchains. The presale has now reached its 8th stage out of 10, offering investors a limited-time opportunity to purchase CYBRO tokens at the presale price of just $0.045 each. With only two stages remaining, the Token Generation Event (TGE) is fast approaching, at which point prices are expected to soar. Experts are projecting a potential ROI of 1200%, making this one of the most exciting investment opportunities in the DeFi ecosystem. In addition to its token offering, CYBRO has introduced a Points system, further enhancing investor incentives. Holders of these Points will automatically qualify for participation in the CYBRO Airdrop, with token distribution tied directly to the number of Points held. The platform allocates up to 1 million Points on a weekly basis, which investors can accrue through positions in CYBRO’s DeFi Vaults. Holders of CYBRO tokens will enjoy lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, cashback on purchases, reduced trading and lending fees, and a robust insurance program within the platform. With only 21% of the total tokens available for this presale and approximately 100 million already sold, this is a golden opportunity for savvy investors to secure a stake in a project that's truly one in a million. >>>Join CYBRO and aim for future returns up to 1200% Solana's Scalable Blockchain: Discovering SOL's Role in Dapps Development Solana is a blockchain platform that focuses on scalability. It provides a base for decentralized applications, known as dapps. Competing with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana aims for faster transactions through its unique architecture. It supports development in multiple programming languages, making it flexible for developers. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of Solana. It is essential to the ecosystem. SOL is used for transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding those who support the network. The coin holds value as it powers the Solana ecosystem and gives users access to various projects. Solana does not use sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. Instead, it attracts developers and investors with its high-capacity network. TRON (TRX): Empowering Content Creators with Decentralized Technology TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain platform that aims to change how content creators earn rewards. It allows creators to have full ownership of their digital content. Users can directly support creators without intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook. TRON supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Developers can build dApps on TRON and offer content in exchange for digital assets. The platform uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin, where transactions are recorded in a public ledger. TRON offers an open way to create and share content without worrying about transaction fees. It serves as an alternative to Ethereum for building decentralized applications. Conclusion In summary, while coins like SOL and TRX have had notable performances, their short-term potential appears limited. CYBRO stands out as a technologically advanced DeFi platform offering investors exceptional opportunities to enhance their earnings. Through AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain, it provides lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. The platform ensures a superior user experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. Emphasizing transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO has attracted strong interest from crypto whales and influencers. As the market experiences significant growth in 2024, CYBRO is positioned to surpass expectations and potentially achieve remarkable gains in the coming months.

While the likes of Pepe are also seeing strong growth, several emerging meme coins could be set for even bigger gains. SHIB Catching Up After DOGE Rally Shiba Inu has begun showing strength against Dogecoin this week, a signal that attention and liquidity will begin to rotate from the market leader in the weeks ahead. Dogecoin has enjoyed monumental success this month, adding over $35 billion to its market cap. However, this week’s momentum has slowed. It’s gained 4.5%, while Shiba Inu is up 17%. DOGE is up 172% this month, while SHIB is up 69%. There’s a big gap for Shiba Inu to fill. And that’s what analysts think is about to happen. Currently, SHIB is trading at $0.00002992 with a $17.3 billion market cap and a $7.07 billion 24-hour trading volume. The Crypto King notes that SHIB is now “breaking out of a 4-year downtrend.” According to the analyst, the breakout will spark a run toward its ATH, a 174% gain. https://twitter.com/thekryptoking_/status/1863218467757043736 Brett Preparing For Tier-1 Exchange Listings? Prominent analyst and Brett proponent Crash suggests that a Binance or Coinbase listing is incoming for Brett.

Indeed, a tier-1 exchange listing would be bullish for Brett, but Crash also noted how bullish it is that Brett has reached a $2 billion market cap without big-name exchanges. Best Meme Coins to Buy for December Rally While established meme coins continue to grow, several new tokens look like they could provide bigger growth over the Christmas period. Here are three meme coins to watch: Pepe Unchained Pepe Unchained is an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain designed for meme coins. Right now, it’s undergoing a presale, which means investors can buy at what could be the best-ever price. The presale has raised $63 million so far, showing massive demand. The chain is expected to be 100x faster than Ethereum and much chepaer, which makes it ideal for trading meme coins. It’ll also have a “Pepe Pump Pad,” a meme coin launchpad that allows anyone to create a token without coding. https://twitter.com/pepe_unchained/status/1839304995465998825 Other features include a block explorer, staking, and a decentralized exchange. The presale will end in 11 days, and then $PEPU will debut on the open market. According to the website, it will list on tier-1 exchanges. With meme coins on the rise, Pepe Unchained is emerging at just the right time. Catslap Catslap is a new cat-themed meme coin on the Ethereum network. The project offers a Slap-to-Earn game that allows users to earn free tokens. It launched on exchanges less than two weeks ago but has already seen significant success. At its peak, it pumped over 58x from its launch price. However, investors now have a second buying opportunity after $SLAP retraced with the rest of the market. https://twitter.com/CatSlapToken/status/1863265620600422475 The project has almost $4 million in locked liquidity, 8,000 holders, $900K in 24-hour trading volume, and 12K followers on its social media channels. Evidently, the market is paying close attention to this project. This early momentum could indicate $SLAP is the next cat-themed meme coin to explode. It has a $24 million market cap, leaving massive room for growth to catch the top cat coins such as Popcat and Mog Coin. Catslap is back on the rise, pumping 5% in the last hour and 4% in the last six hours. Flockez Flockerz is a meme coin all about decentralization. The project distributes control to its holders via a “Vote-to-Earn” decentralized autonomous exchange (DAO). This means $FLOCK holders get to vote on all key decisions relating to the project’s future and get paid for it. Self-appointed and centralized teams control many meme coins, and holders have no say in the projects’ future direction. Flockerz offers an attractive alternative, and its proving in popular demand. https://twitter.com/FlockerzToken/status/1862874262769746259 And there’s more. Users can also stake their $FLOCK tokens to increase their rewards. Right now, Flockerz staking offers a 583% APY, but this will gradually decrease as the staking pool grows. Flockerz is currently undergoing a presale and has raised $4.1 million so far.

37139493,https://blockworks.co/news/retail-adoption-crypto-cycle,1733155200,Retail could undergo ‘real adoption’ this cycle: WisdomTree,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . We’re three weeks out from Christmas. As David pointed out in today’s Empire newsletter, we’re in an interesting spot, which leads WisdomTree’s Jason Guthrie to wonder if there’s enough momentum to last till the end of the year. I personally don’t have a crystal ball, so that’s a little hard to work out as it stands. If you were on an early Thanksgiving break last week, then you may have missed the price levels to watch with bitcoin , but that’s about as far as we can go in trying to predict what’s next. So instead, what about how we’re looking at this moment? “The space, to me right now, does feel reasonably healthy,” Guthrie said. “​​There aren’t a lot of individual projects or companies that seem to be bolstering or driving this in a very meaningful way. And I think that’s very distinctly different from previous cycles where there was a hyped-up innovation, whether it was NFTs or memecoins or something like that, or one big firm like FTX that really seemed to be kind of dominating the narrative … that feels a little shakier than what we’ve got now, which just seemed like a more diversified groundswell, if you like, through the space more generally. People are building innovative things we don’t have … it seems much more use case focused,” he added. Though, to be fair, at this point it does seem like memecoins are one of the dominant narratives. How long that lasts is anyone’s game, especially given they’re seen as a pathway in for retail. Guthrie’s not sure we’re going to see the same level of retail excitement this cycle as we saw last go around, leading him to think that we might see a bit more of a “muted run. ” That’s not necessarily “an unhealthy thing for the space in any way,” he said. Instead, this might be the cycle where we see more real adoption, rather than a small crowd of retail with high-net worths putting large portions of that into crypto. “I would rather that that demand was coming from tens of millions of people doing something that makes sense for them, rather than a handful of people putting in a very large portion of their portfolio. And I think retail coming back in the future might look much more like a general risk-on sentiment, as opposed to this really loud hype from a relatively small community,” Guthrie said. Perhaps there’s space for both the retail crowd that wants to dabble in memecoins, and those adding crypto to portfolios as a risk-on investment.

In a rapid-fire presentation lasting just over three minutes, Saylor presented 44 slides outlining why Microsoft should adopt Bitcoin. “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next technology wave, and Bitcoin is that wave,” Saylor stated in a Dec. 1 video of his pitch. He suggested the firm convert its cash flows, dividends, stock buybacks, and debt into Bitcoin, claiming: “If you do that, you’ll add hundreds of dollars to the stock price. You can create trillions of dollars of enterprise value. You can strip away risk from your shareholders.” Saylor projected that Microsoft’s share price could increase by up to $584 over the next decade if Bitcoin reached $1.7 million by 2034. This strategy, according to Saylor, could add $4.9 trillion to Microsoft’s valuation, propelling it beyond its current $3.18 trillion market cap as the world’s third most valuable company, trailing Apple and Nvidia. Bitcoin has already surged 120% this year, nearing the $100,000 mark. Since 2020, MicroStrategy has purchased 386,700 BTC for $21.9 billion, now valued at nearly $37.6 billion. MicroStrategy shares have soared 465.5% in 2024, with the stock reaching $421.88 in late November, a new all-time high since the dot-com era. Saylor noted growing political and public support for Bitcoin, citing statements from incoming U.S. President Donald Trump and Bitcoin-backed products from major Wall Street firms. He proposed Microsoft invest $100 billion annually in Bitcoin, asserting, “It makes a lot more sense to buy Bitcoin than to buy your own stock back or to hold bonds.” “It’s time for Microsoft to evaluate its Bitcoin strategic options,” Saylor concluded. “So do the right thing for the world and adopt Bitcoin.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/michael-saylor-claims-microsoft-could-hit-5-trillion-ahead-of-bitcoin-vote/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Cardano ( ADA ) coin jumped by over 220% during the month, making it one of the best performers. Its market cap jumped to $38 billion, bringing it back to the top ten biggest cryptocurrency. Cardano’s rally was mostly because of the momentum in the crypto industry after Donald Trump won the general election. As a result, analysts expect that there will be a spot ADA ETF, possibly in 2025. ADA will also benefit from the light-touch regulations by the Trump administration.

Poised to commence in March 2025, the academy’s return to Europe after a two-year hiatus will offer a new generation of developers the chance to gain hands-on expertise in blockchain and web3 technologies. At the heart of the initiative is a partnership with the prestigious Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, renowned for its commitment to innovation and applied research. The collaboration underscores PBA’s mission to cultivate a global pool of developer talent equipped to tackle the onchain challenges of tomorrow. Lucerne: A Hub of Learning and Innovation Nestled in the picturesque Swiss Alps, Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts boasts a reputation for cutting-edge research and a strong emphasis on applied learning. Its newly established institute for blockchain research makes it an ideal setting for the European cohort of Polkadot Blockchain Academy . The university combines state-of-the-art facilities with a commitment to fostering technological advancement, creating an inspiring environment for developers looking to deepen their blockchain knowledge. The decision to host Cohort 6 in Lucerne reflects the academy’s recognition of the university’s role as a thought leader in blockchain and its potential to provide students with a supportive, innovation-driven framework. Cohort 6 of PBA will offer an intensive, nearly three-week program tailored to developers at different stages of their journey. The curriculum is divided into two tracks. The Protocol (on-chain) track will focus on the foundational aspects of Polkadot’s architecture and blockchain engineering. The newly introduced Dapps (off-chain) track, meanwhile, is designed to meet the growing demand for decentralized application development. Led by experts including Dr. Gavin Wood, Polkadot’s co-founder and visionary, the academy emphasizes practical training, ensuring that participants leave with skills they can immediately apply in their careers. The academy isn’t limited to Polkadot enthusiasts; it caters to blockchain developers across ecosystems and even web2 engineers eager to transition into web3. Breaking Barriers to Blockchain Education For many aspiring developers, the costs of gaining sufficient training to attain an industry job can prove prohibitive. Polkadot Blockchain Academy eliminates this impediment for those fortunate enough to be accepted onto the course. Thanks to funding from the Polkadot Treasury, Cohort 6 participants will have their course fees, accommodation, and some meals covered, significantly lowering the financial threshold for entry. The rigorous application process ensures that only the most dedicated candidates make it through. Applicants must pass a blockchain fundamentals exam, complete a programming assignment, and navigate an interview. Those who need a preparatory boost can turn to PBA-X, Polkadot’s online school, which provides foundational courses to help them qualify. This selective process ensures that the approximately 100 developers accepted are not only technically proficient but also deeply motivated to make their mark in the blockchain industry. For those with a passion for decentralized systems, the Lucerne course offers more than an education: it’s an entry point into a global movement. Whether attendees aim to design next-generation dapps or secure the backbone of blockchain protocols, PBA provides the tools, mentorship, and community to succeed.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | FIAT | REGULATION | RESEARCH,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/polkadot-blockchain-academy-europe-lucerne-university-dev-course/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37146434,https://crypto.news/?p=14315499,1733154721,"3 Cryptos to consider buying for Christmas rally – XRP, Shiba Inu, Pepe Unchained","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. December begins with investor optimism for gains. Notable tokens to watch: XRP, Shiba Inu, and Pepe Unchained. December is here, and investors are hoping for a big month of festive gains. Right now, three of the best tokens to buy are XRP, Shiba Inu, and Pepe Unchained. Let’s take a look at each. XRP XRP has just surpassed USDT to become the third-largest cryptocurrency, leading the market alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. The project has enjoyed a meteoric rise this month, soaring 366%. This has happened following SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s recent announcement that he’ll be stepping down from his position on 20 January – the same day Trump is inaugurated. The SEC has been in a long-standing legal fight against XRP’s founder, Ripple Labs, but Gensler’s resignation marks an end to the crusade. https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI/status/1863358055469002807 XRP is currently trading at $2.38, up 27% today and 62% this week. This puts its market cap at $130 billion. Its current all-time high (ATH) is $3.84, which was hit in 2018. Due to its SEC lawsuit, it was unable to create a new ATH in the 2021 bull market, but with that out of the way, new highs could be imminent. You might also like: Pepe Unchained hits landmark $30M milestone – presale ends in just 28 days Shiba Inu Shiba Inu is another large-cap crypto that could be on the brink of a macro-time-frame breakout. Last week, Dogecoin reached heights not seen since 2021, adding $40 billion to its market cap in a seven-day window. But now, Dogecoin is slowing, and Shiba Inu is displaying the most momentum. To benchmark how explosive things could get for SHIB, DOGE is up 167% in the past month. A Comparison of $DOGE and $SHIB A closer look at the price movements of $DOGE and $SHIB reveals an interesting correlation. $SHIB tends to follow $DOGE 's price trajectory. Notably, $DOGE has recently experienced a significant pump, while $SHIB is currently lagging behind. #shiba pic.twitter.com/LQAKKkRDa1 — Trader world (@TraderWorldd) December 2, 2024 SHIB is currently at a 70% premium but is now showing strengthpace. While DOGE has risen 2.5% this week, SHIB is up 16.9%. This indicates a potential paradigm shift which could see SHIB lead the next rally. Adding to this, Shiba Inu is an Ethereum-native meme coin, and Ethereum also shows strength. After two years of underperforming Bitcoin, ETH started gaining pace, pumping 9.2% this week while Bitcoin is down 1%. This rising liquidity of the Ethereum ecosystem will undoubtedly bolster SHIB’s ongoing rally. Pepe Unchained Pepe Unchained is another crypto benefiting from Ethereum’s rising tide. It’s an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain focused on meme coins. The project offers a heightened user experience, with 100x faster speeds and much lower fees than the main network. It has all the features you’d expect from a top blockchain and more. This includes staking, a block explorer, a dedicated Ethereum bridge, and a decentralized exchange. But the feature causing the biggest buzz is Pepe Pump Pad, a meme coin generator similar to Solana’s Pump.fun. As of today, the top 5 meme coins launched on competitor launchpads have a cumulative market cap of over $1 Billion. That means YOU could not only launch and run your own coin. But profit massively from its success. — Pepe Unchained (@pepe_unchained) November 6, 2024 This allows anyone to launch a meme coin at a marginal cost without coding. As such, the Pepe Unchained ecosystem could grow rapidly, fueled by a diverse set of meme coins created by everyday users. The project is currently undergoing a presale, which has raised $63 million so far. However, the Pepe Unchained ICO is set to end in 11 days, and then $PEPU will list on tier-1 exchanges.

According to Saylor, Bitcoin's integration could provide significant returns, bolster shareholder confidence, and reduce counterparty risks. This perspective aligns with the growing public and institutional support for Bitcoin, including endorsements from Wall Street and increasing political backing.

With over $3 million raised in its presale, Lunex stands out as an accessible and innovative option for investors who eye the next bull run. Meanwhile, Solana and Ripple continue to dominate headlines, bolstered by the Bitwise filings for ETFs that could reshape dynamics in the market. Why Lunex Is Gaining Momentum Lunex addresses critical blockchain challenges by streamlining cross-chain transactions. This approach minimizes costs and improves liquidity, key factors for scalability in decentralized finance. Tokens are priced at just $0.0033, offering investors an affordable entry into a project built for sustainability. The 18% revenue-sharing model rewards long-term holders, making Lunex an attractive alternative for those seeking consistent returns. As the DeFi ecosystem expands, Lunex’s focus on interoperability positions it to rival larger players. While Solana and Ripple lead in market presence, Lunex appeals to investors looking for growth opportunities tied to practical, user-focused solutions. XRP ETF Developments Boost Ripple Activity on Ripple (XRP) saw a surge after the announcement of an XRP ETF filing by Bitwise. Analysts expect the XRP price could climb further, with the $2 mark well within reach as December approaches. The potential of Ripple extends far beyond short-term gains. Projections suggest a price of $33.21 by 2025, because XRP captures the attention of both retail and institutional investors. The XRP ETF filing reinforces the idea that institutional interest is here to stay and this drives Ripple’s momentum in the ongoing bull run. Solana Prepares for Its Next Big Move Solana (SOL) reached a new all-time high of $264. Despite a pullback to $222, market optimism remains strong. Analysts predict another rally, where SOL targets of $300 or even more in the coming weeks. The Bitwise SOL ETF filing further strengthens the appeal of Solana. It’s known for its fast transaction speeds and efficient ecosystem and because of that Solana consistently ranks among the most favored platforms for decentralized applications. ETF-related developments bolsters institutional confidence and underscores its position as a top contender for gains in the bull run. Lunex Stands Out in a Crowded Market While Solana and Ripple benefit from institutional backing, Lunex offers unique advantages for those seeking high-growth opportunities in DeFi. Its focus on cross-chain functionality fills a critical gap in the ecosystem. For backers of Lunex, the current market climate presents a golden opportunity. As XRP and SOL ETFs gain traction, Lunex could capitalize on the rising tide of institutional and retail investment in decentralized finance. With practical solutions and a clear growth strategy, Lunex positions itself as a leading contender in the next bull run. The Time to Act Is Now The Bitwise filings for XRP ETF and SOL ETF mark a pivotal moment for the crypto market. Solana and Ripple are positioned for significant growth, but Lunex brings fresh potential to the table. With its innovative approach and accessible entry point, Lunex offers a compelling option for investors aiming to stay ahead in the DeFi space. For those ready to act, Lunex combines affordability with innovation, making it a standout choice as DeFi gains momentum. The bull run is shaping the future of crypto, and Lunex is poised to play a key role in what’s to come.

The only project that unites the top meme coins to harness their collective memetic power and offer huge staking rewards has sparked massive FOMO, with less than 18 days remaining in its presale. As funding continues to pour in, the outlook for $STARS’ debut on exchanges is sky-high, with some predicting potential returns of 10x or more. This momentum has earned Crypto All-Stars widespread attention, including praise from popular crypto influencer Daryl Boo, who has called $STARS “the most bullish coin of 2024.” At its current presale price of $0.0016582, early investors have a rare opportunity to secure positions for maximum gain. With the rapidly growing interest, this price point may never be seen again. Meme coins are taking over, and Crypto All-Stars is spicing things up The meme coin sector, with a collective market valuation of $127 billion, clearly demonstrates the significant value in internet culture. Currently ranked 18th in market capitalization across all crypto sectors, meme coins have become a force to be reckoned with, according to CoinGecko data. This is remarkable, considering that just eight years ago, only one meme coin – Dogecoin ($DOGE) – was making headlines. Today, multiple meme coins are in the spotlight, shifting attention away from many altcoins. With this surge in popularity, it’s not unthinkable that meme coins could one day break into the top 10 sectors in the crypto industry. As of November, two of the top-performing assets in the space were Dogecoin and Shiba Inu ($SHIB), with Dogecoin delivering a 310% gain year-to-date and Shiba Inu following with 150%. In comparison, Bitcoin, which reached new all-time highs in November, ranked fourth, with Solana ($SOL) taking third. This trend isn’t limited to just the well-established meme coins. Lesser-known tokens, such as Chill Guy ($CHILLGUY), have seen a 120% jump on mere rumors of a Binance listing last week – further proof of the immense potential in this sector. Source: CoinGecko And to spice things up with even higher returns, the Crypto All-Stars meme coins staking platform – the MemeVault – is here. It’s starting to become a race to buy $STARS Crypto All-Stars’ MemeVault is the industry’s first unified meme coin staking platform that brings together top meme coins like $DOGE, $SHIB, Brett ($BRETT) – which recently hit an all-time high similar to $BTC – and potentially $CHILLGUY and other rising meme coins set to break into the top meme coin list. This staking protocol, once launched, will simplify the staking process by eliminating the need to juggle multiple protocols to generate returns. This All-Star train is still going! They are having a blast! pic.twitter.com/3WYhAeohWL — Crypto All-Stars (@all_stars_coin) November 27, 2024 Instead, users can rely on just one protocol to quickly generate passive income for their meme coin stash. Now, where does $STARS fit into all this? The answer lies in it being the key to unlocking the full potential of MemeVault. Simply holding $STARS can multiply staking rewards by up to three times the normal rate, which is why it’s no wonder investors are rushing to secure as much $STARS in presale as they can. Furthermore, users are also taking advantage of the platform’s independent staking protocol to grow their holdings at 282% APY before the MemeVault launch. The race to become a Crypto All-Stars whale intensifies with each passing day. Binance wants to focus on utility rather than meme coins – wait till CZ learns about Crypto All-Stars Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) recently voiced his growing frustration with crypto’s whimsical assets, despite his company aggressively listing meme coins. CZ has made it clear that he wants to focus on blockchain projects with real utility. I am not against memes, but meme coins are getting ""a little"" weird now. Let's build real applications using blockchain. — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) November 26, 2024 However, CZ might have to retract his statement once Crypto All-Stars catches his attention. With the MemeVault in its corner, Crypto All-Stars is far from just a meme coin. The ease with which it generates passive returns for users is a form of utility that the sector is embracing with open arms. Crypto All-Stars wasn’t built just to entertain or satisfy the crypto degen’s risk appetite – it’s also about creating more stable returns for a sector driven mostly by wild speculation. In this way, Crypto All-Stars could be the future the sector needs to boost its valuation and legitimize and establish meme coins as a credible, high-value part of the crypto ecosystem. In other words, becoming an early supporter of Crypto All-Stars now is like backing the future of meme coins. How do we back the future of meme coins? Buy $STARS To give the future of meme coins a leg up, be a $STARS holder today and support the launch of MemeVault. Visit the Crypto All-Stars website , connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ), and swap ETH, USDT, or BNB for $STARS. Bank cards are also accepted. In addition, you can use popular meme coins like $FLOKI, $SHIB, $DOGE, and $PEPE to grab $STARS tokens through the site’s easy-to-use widget. Crypto All-Stars prioritizes investor peace of mind, which is why two leading crypto audit firms, Coinsult and SolidProof , have thoroughly audited its smart code. These audits confirm that its code is free from critical errors. Engage with the Crypto All-Stars community on Telegram or X. The presale could easily reach its next funding goal of $9 million this week, especially as it nears its close.

On-chain data has attributed this mindblowing monthly rally to whales accumulating the asset, mostly on Coinbase. It almost seems like a repeat now when it comes down to XRP’s price performances in the past month and since Sunday, in particular, but there’s a lot going on around the asset. Recall that just yesterday, Ripple’s native token traded at around $1.9. However, it exploded first to over $2.2, as reported, before it shot up to $2.5 for the first time since January 2018. During the market-wide retracement from earlier on Monday, it slipped back down to $2.2, but the bulls stepped up on the gas pedal once again and initiated another massive rally. This time, XRP’s price skyrocketed to $2.75, which became a new local peak. Moreover, the cryptocurrency came just 23% away from its all-time high of $3.4 (CoinGecko data). XRPUSD. Source: TradingView Despite retracing slightly to under $2.7 now, XRP is still up by over 420% in the past month. This surge has pushed its market cap to well beyond $150 billion, solidifying its place as the third-largest cryptocurrency by this metric. Many reports claimed that this rally was driven primarily by whales accumulating substantial portions of the asset. CryptoQuant’s CEO, Ki Young Ju, confirmed this narrative but also shed some more light, noting that most of the buying took place on Coinbase. This makes sense due to the expected political change in the United States following Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential elections and Gary Gensler’s announcement that he will step down as SEC Chair in January. Coinbase whales are driving this $XRP rally. Over the past 30 days, Coinbase’s minute-level price premium has ranged from 3% to 13% during the surge. Meanwhile, Upbit—a Korean exchange with more XRP investors than Binance—has shown no significant premium so far. pic.twitter.com/ENESB2Zrkv — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 2, 2024 The post Ripple Price Eyes $3 as XRP Goes Parabolic: Who Is Behind This Rally? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-price-eyes-3-as-xrp-goes-parabolic-who-is-behind-this-rally/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37138881.jpeg

Here Are the Details,"Spot cryptocurrency trading reached new highs in November, with monthly trading volume on exchanges reaching $2.71 trillion, the highest level since May 2021. Spot Crypto Exchange Volume Hits $2.7 Trillion in November, Highest Since 2021 This figure was more than double the $1.14 trillion volume in October, underscoring the revival in market activity. Data revealed that Binance traded over $986 billion, accounting for around 36% of November volume. Other major players include Crypto.com, Upbit, and Bybit, each of which surpassed $200 billion in monthly trading volume. Significant growth was observed across regions, highlighting a global increase in trading activity. Bitcoin and Ethereum futures also saw significant growth, with Bitcoin futures volume reaching $2.59 trillion and Ethereum futures volume reaching $1.28 trillion, both reaching their highest levels since May 2021. Catalysts for Growth The record-breaking activity comes after pro-crypto Republican Donald Trump was re-elected as US President on November 6. Trump's victory sparked a wave of optimism in the crypto market, with Bitcoin surpassing its previous all-time high to reach $99,635. Solana also hit a new record high, with the GMCI 30 index tracking the top 30 cryptocurrencies rising 62.3% in November. *This is not investment advice.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/mr-chill-doge-mrdoge-solana-memecoin-to-explode-14000-before-exchange-listing-as-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The company may allow initial buyers to purchase an extra $105 million in notes within 13 days of issuance. $700M Convertible Notes Offering MARA plans to use up to $50 million from the note sale to buy back part of its 2026 convertible notes through private deals. The rest of the funds will go toward acquiring more Bitcoin and general purposes like working capital, strategic acquisitions, asset expansion, and debt repayment, according to the official press release . The company expects the notes to be issued with no interest, except in rare cases where special interest may apply, and the principal amount is expected to remain unchanged. The notes, maturing in 2030, are convertible into cash, equity, or a combination of the two. This strategy helps MARA improve its balance sheet by replacing short-term obligations with long-term debt while continuing its investment in digital assets. The move comes less than a week after MARA acquired 6,474 BTC from its $1 billion convertible note offering at 0% interest. In the same announcement, the company also revealed buying $200 million worth of its 2026 notes and plans to use the remaining $160 million to purchase more Bitcoin at more favorable prices during market dips. This strategy aligns with MicroStrategy’s approach of issuing corporate debt to increase BTC holdings, a growing trend among businesses. Bitcoin For Financial Sovereignty: MARA’s Recommendations MARA Holdings recently called on the United States policymakers to take the lead in Bitcoin mining, positioning the asset as crucial for national security and financial sovereignty. The mining company stressed Bitcoin’s finite supply, decentralization, and cross-border transferability, comparing it to gold as a store of value. MARA argued that controlling Bitcoin’s blockspace and hash rate would ensure access to secure transactions, preventing manipulation by “adversarial” nations. The firm recommended the US to develop domestic Bitcoin mining infrastructure, prioritize renewable energy adoption, and reduce reliance on foreign ASIC chips. This strategic shift could strengthen the economy, boost energy grids, and create high-tech jobs.

XRP has been rising ever since Donald Trump won last month’s election, yet compared to many other major token it remains relatively underpriced, which is why it has been beating the market in recent days. It’s now up by 50% in a week and by a huge 340% in a month, with these ascents enabling it to overtake Solana in terms of market cap. And given that it’s still down on its 2018 ATH by 33%, it could continue to see outsized gains for a while yet, as the marker catches up with its potential value. XRP Overtakes Solana and Tether as Market Cap Reaches $139 Billion – Can XRP Hit $100 Next? XRP is currently correcting after hitting what was its highest price since January 2018, with the coin reaching a 24-hour peak of $2.48 earlier this morning. Its indicators do suggest that it may have entered an overbought position, with its relative strength index (purple) falling from just over 80 to just over 50. Source: TradingView Its 30-period average (orange) has potentially peaked in relation to the longer term 200-period average (blue), something which also indicates that a correction should be coming. However, the market had oversold and undervalued XRP for years, so it may take several more weeks of catch up before the coin stops rising. Its volume has touched $36.7 billion today, which is its highest level ever, and a very strong sign of exploding demand. The past few days have seen some big XRP buys from whales , who continue to stock up on the token in expectation of future gains. 12,160,698 #XRP (29,863,787 USD) transferred from #Binance to unknown wallet https://t.co/F91qzkiQQv — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 2, 2024 Aside from its undervaluation, XRP has been performing so well because of how the election of Donald Trump has changed the regulatory landscape for it and Ripple. While the SEC had filed an appeal against the company prior to the election, Trump’s victory likely means that this appeal is now dead in the water (and some legal experts had suggested it didn’t have much of a chance anyway). And with current SEC Chairman Gary Gensler recently confirming that he will step down upon Trump’s inauguration, the next four years could end up being very profitable for Ripple. My $XRP Price Targets: $0.75 $0.90 $1.50 $1.80 $2.40 $5 $8 $10 $22 $30 $130 $700 $1000 $10,000+ — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) December 1, 2024 It’s therefore on track to pass its current ATH of $3.40 in the next few months, potentially reaching this milestone by H2 2025. New High-Performance Meme Tokens Traders worried that XRP is already overbought may prefer to turn to newer, small-cap tokens, which can often have more upside potential, particularly if they attract new listings. And one very coin on the up right now is Catslap (SLAP), an Ethereum-based token that has launched directly to DEXes. It started trading on Uniswap a few weeks ago , and is up by over 1,000% from its listing price, according to DEXTools . SLAP now boasts around 10,000 holders since listing on November 21, with the coin already having a market cap of $13.6 million. Catslap has been successful since its launching because it’s more than utility-free meme token, with the coin having its very own slap-to-earn mini-game. Users can play this game via Catslap’s official website , which invites users to click (or tap) the screen in order to animate a cat-slap gif. This is an extremely simple mechanic, but the game rewards players with more SLAP tokens, incentivising ownership and engagement with the project.

The bulls have shown impressive strength, fueling optimism for a potential breakout . A successful move beyond $50 could signal the start of a robust rally, capturing the attention of traders and setting the stage for further upside. The goal of this article is to examine AVAX’s upward momentum as it nears the $50 resistance level, assessing the possibility of a breakout. It also delves into the technical and market factors influencing the price action, offering insights into whether the bulls can push AVAX higher or if resistance will trigger a pullback. Bullish Momentum Builds: Can AVAX Break Through? On the 4-hour chart, AVAX is positioned above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a key indicator of its current bullish trajectory. Significantly, this alignment highlights the token’s underlying strength and suggests that positive sentiment is driving its momentum. The steady upward movement reflects growing optimism among traders, with Avalanche now eyeing the critical $50 resistance level. An examination of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the RSI has climbed back above the 70% threshold after experiencing a decline to 52%, signaling a resurgence in buying pressure and reflecting renewed bullish movement in the market. A persistent climb would indicate strong overbought conditions, suggesting robust demand and the possibility of more price growth. Also, the daily chart highlights AVAX’s strong upward movement, marked by the formation of a bullish candlestick as the price surges toward $50. Its position above the SMA reinforces the positive trend, demonstrating sustained strength. This upward movement bolsters market confidence, setting the stage for a continued rally . Lastly, the daily chart’s RSI recently reached 75%, indicating that AVAX has entered overbought territory. This suggests a strong optimistic sentiment, with significant buying pressure pushing the price higher. While this level points to the potential for more upside, it also signals that the asset may be overheating. Breakout Or Pullback On The Horizon? As Avalanche nears the crucial $50 resistance level, two possible outcomes are unfolding: a breakout or a pullback. If the bullish momentum persists, AVAX could surpass the $50 mark, sparking a rally toward higher levels. This would signal a continuation of the upward trend, with the next target being the $65 resistance level. However, if the $50 resistance holds, a pullback may follow, with the price possibly testing the $42 support level. A break below this level could lead to further downside, pushing AVAX toward additional support zones.",POSITIVE,AVAX,AVAX | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/avax/avax-price-inches-closer-to-50/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

In an X post reaching out to Ripple enthusiasts, Raoul said : You Were Right, I Was Wrong. Well done! Dinosaurs still roam the earth. Raoul Pal Referring to them as “ XRP Jedi Warriors .” the crypto expert admitted his misjudgment while acknowledging their foresight regarding the token’s potential price rally. This comes after Ripple-affiliated cryptocurrency XRP experienced a dramatic rise beyond the $2 threshold, reclaiming its long-lost third position on the CoinMarketCap rankings. Pal also conceded that the Ripple community had “walked through hell to get here.” He reminded his audience that he still holds some of the Ripple tokens from the turbulent “delisting times” in 2021. During that period, following the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple and XRP—alleging the token was an unregistered security—several significant exchanges like Coinbase, Binance US, and Bitstamp suspended XRP trading. However, these platforms continued to allow users to hold Ripple in their wallets and enabled withdrawals and deposits without restrictions. XRP outperforms BNB, Solana, and USDT In August, Raoul Pal expressed skepticism about XRP and ADA, labeling them “cult” coins and cautioning investors against investing in these older assets. At that time, Ripple was trading around $0.50, showing minimal growth and ranking among the worst-performing crypto assets. With XRP’s recent breakthrough—first surpassing $1 and then surging beyond $2—Pal has admitted his earlier stance was incorrect. The token has surged to over $2.40, experiencing a remarkable 400% increase in value. The token has surpassed BNB and Solana in market rankings, including the largest stablecoin, USDT. It is now just behind Ethereum. Ripple unlocks 1 billion XRP as token surges The cryptocurrency market saw a general gain during the “Trump trade” phenomenon in November, although Ripple experienced minor setbacks due to its protracted regulatory limbo. Investors were greatly uneasy because the US SEC complaint claimed that Ripple was an unregistered security. Before these regulatory issues, XRP was the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. However, when the SEC sued Ripple in December 2020, its price dropped from around $0.50 to $0.17, erasing over $15 billion in market value. Now, the crypto’s supporters are optimistic about the regulatory situation improving. Another source of optimism is Ripple’s impending stablecoin, RLUSD. It is scheduled to launch on December 4, 2024, and is just awaiting approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Once approved, Ripple can legally offer RLUSD to the public.

The price is heading towards the yearly highs at $22.89 with an aim to set up a bullish path towards the ATH. The price recorded one of the most bullish monthly closes, with a rise of over 80%, not seen since the 2021 bull run. The price printed massive bullish candles then, and hence a similar pattern suggests the LINK pric e is at the foothill of a massive explosion, which may elevate the levels beyond a 3-digit figure. The catalyst of the rise is the recent partnership announcement of Chainlink with 21X, Europe’s first tokenised securities trading and settlement system, to launch the very first EU-regulated financial market infrastructure. With this, the LINK price broke the resistance at $19.25 with a major force, shooting past $20 in the past few hours. All eyes are now on $22.90, which is around the yearly highs, and a breakout from this range may propel the price towards a new ATH. The monthly chart of Chianlink displays a breakout from the multi-year symmetrical triangle before reaching the apex. This suggests strong bullish momentum being piled up since the past month as the buying volume revamped after largely being under bearish influence since the start of the year. The immediate upper target could be around $34.2 at 0.618 FIB, which could pay way for the price to reach the ATH at 1 FIB at $52.88. Meanwhile, the technicals have tuned in favour of the bulls as the RSI has just launched an incremental range along the ascending support as it appeared during the 2021 bull run. On the other hand, the MACD, which was about to undergo a bearish crossover, has reversed as the buying pressure escalates. Therefore, there are clear signals of a bullish continuation with the upper targets as mentioned in the chart, provided the yearly close is above the pattern.

Cardano has experienced a steady rise in recent weeks, reaching the $1.10 mark after a 220% monthly surge. However, sustaining momentum at this level has proven difficult.Multiple attempts to break past $1.10 were met with rejection, indicating a formidable resistance zone. At press time, the crypto trades at $1.07, reflecting a modest 0.12% gain in the last 24 hours.Indicators Signal Potential Reversal for CardanoTechnical analysis signals a growing risk of a price correction for Cardano. The appearance of a TD Sequential sell signal on the 3-day chart hints at a possible trend reversal or pullback. According to analyst Ali Martinez on X, ADA proponents could target $0.88 if the correction occurs. This price point aligns with the Fibonacci 0.786 level, from which a major rebound could follow. Is Cardano Overbought Yet?Momentum indicators support concerns over a potential pullback. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), previously in overbought territory above 70, has begun to drop, signaling a weakening of bullish momentum.Although there’s no clear bearish divergence yet, the RSI decline, coupled with a red candlestick, could signal the start of a reversal. ADAUSDT 1-day Chart TradingView Meanwhile, the MACD indicator shows the MACD line at 0.1543 and the Signal line at 0.1481, suggesting diminishing momentum. The convergence of these lines raises the possibility of a bearish crossover if the current trend persists.Cardano Long-Term PotentialDespite near-term resistance, some analysts maintain an optimistic outlook for Cardano. Prominent pundit Dapp Central has described this period as a potential final opportunity for accumulation, citing bullish Bitcoin forecasts by Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson. Notably, Hoskinson recently forecasted that Bitcoin could reach between $250,000 and $500,000 within 24 months, which is seen as potentially ushering in a significant bull cycle for altcoins, including Cardano.On the other hand, analyst Lark Davis offers a more ambitious long-term outlook for Cardano. Based on Fibonacci projections, Davis argued ADA could revisit its all-time high of $3.16 during this cycle and even climb to $4.80, $7.70, and ultimately $10.Davis attributes this growth potential to increasing interest in Cardano’s ecosystem and favorable macroeconomic conditions.",NEUTRAL,ADA,ADA | ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/02/amid-major-cardano-bull-run-technical-indicators-signal-sell-off-key-target-to-watch-for-a-favorable-entry/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=amid-major-cardano-bull-run-technical-indicators-signal-sell-off-key-target-to-watch-for-a-favorable-entry,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

In the past four weeks, XRP has experienced a 4X price surge, reaching $2.50 again after seven years of trading below this level. The speed with which it attained this feat has reignited optimism of ambitious analysts about XRP’s prospects. Some call for far higher double-digit prices, while others even target triple-digit values.Edward joined the conversation by disclosing his price prediction for XRP, estimating it will reach between $5 and $8. While he remains open to the possibility that XRP could slightly exceed this range, he views this as a realistic and safe projection for the current market cycle.XRP Predictions of $589 to $10,000 Targets Are FantasyMeanwhile, Edward expressed strong skepticism about the more extreme price forecasts that have circulated in recent weeks. According to him, analysts predicting astronomical figures, like $10,000 for XRP, are delusional. ""People calling for $589, $1,000, or $10,000 are out of their minds,"" he said.At press time, XRP is experiencing a pullback, trading at $2.30. To reach $5 from the current level, XRP would need to grow by 118%. Meanwhile, the upper target of $8 requires a growth of 248%.Given that XRP has seen more substantial growth than these levels since November, some market commentators disagree with a peak of $5 to $8. Commentators argue that Edward may not fully grasp XRP's potential. Others insisted that calling for an $8 peak is too early since the bull market could endure for another 12 months. XRP Army expressing disagreement Factor Fueling Ambitious Outlooks for XRPX user Erick von Schulz remarked that while Edward's conservative estimate would normally be accurate, he cited upcoming developments that call for a revised outlook. Specifically, Schulz believes the arrival of the RLUSD stablecoin on XRP’s blockchain this month, coupled with seven years of price suppression, increasing institutional adoption, and the expected ETFs, are massive bullish catalysts that could drive XRP to much higher prices.Accordingly, Schulz noted that he has revised his target for XRP to $15+ and will adjust it further as new information becomes available.Notably, market commentators calling for more conservative outlooks believe that as XRP climbs higher, its explosive price potential will progressively decrease as its market cap expands. As a result, they consider overly optimistic targets unrealistic for the short term.",NEUTRAL,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/02/expert-says-realistic-xrp-targets-are-5-to-8-claims-589-and-1000-are-fantasy/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-says-realistic-xrp-targets-are-5-to-8-claims-589-and-1000-are-fantasy,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

A look at the supply data, though, suggests building pressure for an upward move.  ""Illiquid supply"" refers to the amount of bitcoin that is owned by long-term holders (LTHs) that is not actively traded. According to Glassnode data, illiquid supply has risen by more than 185,000 tokens over the past 30 days and hit an all-time high of 14.8 million BTC, or 75% of the total circulating supply of just under 20 million (only 21 million bitcoin can ever exist). That 185,000 is the second highest 30-day change this year and suggests the main behavior for investors at the moment is holding not trading.    Previous research by CoinDesk shows that sales by LTHs are approaching their end. Since Nov. 26, LTHs as a group have been accumulating, adding more than 2,000 BTC to their stacks. This could mean that the period of realizing profits is coming to an end for this cohort, possibly taking further sell pressure from the market.  Coins are rapidly leaving exchanges   Since the beginning of this latest bull run in early November, bitcoin tokens have been exiting exchanges at a rapid rate. This has ended a nearly two-year trend of bitcoin on exchanges at roughly steady levels, an encouraging sign of further investor demand.  Zooming out over a five-year period, however, shows a somewhat less encouraging picture as bitcoin on exchanges remains in a relatively narrow range of 2.7 million to 3.3 million tokens.  For a more sustainable bull run, BTC will need to keep leaving exchanges — a sign of continuing investor appetite rather than demand from the derivatives side which is a often sign of leverage.   ""Bitcoin's illiquid supply has reached a new all-time high while exchange balances hit a new multi-year low,"" said Andre Dragosch, head of research at Bitwise. ""Almost 75% of supply is deemed 'illiquid' while less than 14% of supply remains on exchanges,"" he continued.

The platform whose mainnet is yet to be released allows users to earn network rewards through staking by utilizing BTC.

Now, the protocol aims to let Dogecoin (DOGE) users in on this opportunity, by allowing them to stake their coins to earn fixed yields in BTC. In the future, the platform aims to introduce more financial applications for meme coins to provide better rewards for DOGE holders. In a statement to Coindesk on Wednesday, GOAT Network announced this latest development. By adding DOGE into its ecosystem, the platform wants to be known as “the home of people’s coins.” As Dogecoin continues to evolve and expand from its meme coin origin, the DOGE community is growing stronger.

A pivotal public hearing for the company’s application under the Nebraska Financial Innovation Act is scheduled for December 5, 2024, at 9:00 AM CST at the First Nebraska Administrative Building in Lincoln. Nebraska Financial Innovation Act paves the way The Nebraska Financial Innovation Act (LB 1074, 2024) has been critical to Telcoin’s journey. This legislation, championed by Congressman Mike Flood, aims to position Nebraska as a hub for digital asset regulation. Flood, who recently secured his US House seat with Trump’s endorsement , was instrumental in drafting the Act in 2021. Telcoin’s application for a Digital Asset Depository Charter has already cleared a significant hurdle. In September 2024, the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance confirmed the application’s completeness. If approved, Telcoin Bank will be the first digital asset bank in the U.S., enabling the issuance of regulated stablecoins, dubbed “Digital Cash.” Digital Cash: A potential game-changer in global payments Telcoin’s vision for its Digital Cash stablecoins extends beyond the $160 billion stablecoin market. Designed to support its remittance services, these stablecoins aim to disrupt traditional payments by offering seamless merchant transactions and integration into decentralized finance (DeFi). CEO Paul Neuner highlighted the importance of the upcoming public hearing in a recent update, emphasizing that it marks a critical step toward approval. The company anticipates charter confirmation in early 2025. Blockchain-based banking products on the horizon Telcoin’s blockchain banking ambitions are gaining traction, attracting attention from mobile network operators (MNOs) and global fintech leaders. The company plans to offer services such as crypto staking and aims to integrate digital assets into the traditional banking ecosystem. Telcoin has already garnered significant investor interest, including a pre-series A fundraising round, to support its vision. Its presence at events like Flyover Fintech, hosted by Congressman Flood, underscores its commitment to reshaping global finance. Implications for the financial landscape If successful, Telcoin Bank could redefine the intersection of blockchain and traditional banking. By leveraging Nebraska’s regulatory framework, Telcoin aims to become a cornerstone in the future of payments and mobile finance, bringing blockchain innovation closer to mainstream adoption.

37138262,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315004,1733151848,Hyperliquid Airdrop Hits All Time High as Investors Turn to This Potential Breakout Coin,"Hyperliquid’s $HYPE token has rallied to an all-time high (ATH) of $9.87 just days after executing the seventh largest airdrop in crypto history. The genesis event on Friday, November 29, saw the team distributing some 310 million $HYPE tokens to its community. These were worth $3.90 at launch, which meant the total value of the airdrop at genesis was $1.2 billion. Over the weekend, the token rallied to a post-launch ATH of $9.87, which meant the value of the airdrop rose to over $3 billion, however, $HYPE now trades 15.9% lower than ATH, at $8.29, after shedding 13.6% in the last 24 hours. It's inspiring to see tens of thousands of community members secure life-changing wealth as part of the Hyperliquid genesis event. Importantly, none of these people were insiders. They: 1) believed in the vision for a better financial system when no one else would 2) acted on… — jeff.hl (@chameleon_jeff) November 30, 2024 Is Hyperliquid’s $HYPE Fading Already? Hyperliquid’s sudden downturn is attributable to a market-wide dip today, which has shaved 1.6% off the price of the world’s favourite cryptocurrency Bitcoin ($BTC) and 2.4% from its number one contender, Ethereum ($ETH). As of this writing, the two market leaders trade for $95,699 and $3,617 respectively. Hyperliquid aims to be a potential “Ethereum killer”. The layer-1 blockchain validates transactions using a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and can process up to 200,000 transactions per second. So, $HYPE is the network’s native utility coin, and can be staked to validate transactions and mine, or used as a gas token for Hyperliquid’s Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible layer, HyperEVM. Source: TradingView While it’s too early to spot trends in Hyperliquid’s performance, the chart above shows $HYPE got off to a bullish start. Over the weekend, the token appeared faced some resistance around the dollar mark, but a support level appears to be forming around $0.70. $HYPE’s relative strength index (RSI) sits at 58 and rising, indicating more buying than selling right now, which should help the token retain its gains. Indeed, should Bitcoin rise, it’s likely $HYPE will too, making $10 an easily achievable target over the festive season. From Hyperliquid to Catslap: Christmas Abounds with New Tokens All told, ’tis truly the season to be jolly over in Web3. While Hyperliquid’s $HYPE airdrop has been setting records this weekend, over in the weird and wonderful world of meme coins, one new project has its sights on becoming the biggest cat meme coin in the world. For the last week, investors have gone crazy over a viral Ethereum meme coin that debuted on Uniswap last week . Within 24 hours it had blown up over 1,500% as investors snapped it up, intrigued by the project’s tap-to-slap mini game. The game is on Catslap’s official website , where players click (or tap) the screen in order to animate a gif of the viral slapping cat. The game logs each by country and distributes rewards to the nation at the top of the leaderboard. As of last Friday, players can enable a ‘Slap to Earn’ function which will bring up the leaderboard, with a wallet connect option. Once the wallet is connected and holding $SLAP tokens, players then earn Slap points, which pay out in additional $SLAPs. The project’s X account already boasts over 10,000 followers in a week of trading. Catslap has a maximum supply of 9 billion, with 50% for liquidity, 20% to staking—where investors can earn 40% for locking up their tokens, 10% to community rewards, 10% to development, and 10% to its team (with this latter allocation vested for ten years). Procure Catslap via Uniswap or directly via the official website , where 1 SLAP is $0.00325003. The website urges investors to “buy and stake $SLAP before major announcement!” along with a timer displaying just over six days left. All this has helped Catslap become one of the nineteen best new meme coins on the market right now.

37137705,https://finbold.com/?p=216360,1733151811,Why this week ‘isn’t the best for Bitcoin to shine’,"Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) potential push toward $100,000 might face further delays as the asset will likely encounter volatility later in the week driven by macroeconomic signals. This anticipated volatility arises as Bitcoin’s chart pattern shows the maiden digital asset is consolidating, and this week’s labor report data might not cast the asset in the spotlight, according to professional cryptocurrency trading expert Michaël van de Poppe in an X post on December 2. Poppe suggested that volatility caused by labor market data could push Bitcoin below $90,000, potentially creating new entry opportunities. “Bitcoin is nicely consolidating, and it’s labor data week. That isn’t the best period for Bitcoin to shine, through which the optimal spot for entries (if corrections happen) is coming back into play,” he said. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Suppose Bitcoin fails to break the six-figure resistance and labor market dynamics trigger a price drop, he predicts the asset may find support at $85,000–$88,000, levels he considers ideal for accumulation. Regarding the impact of the upcoming report, strong data may signal economic resilience but also raise inflation concerns, increasing the likelihood of interest rate hikes and reducing the appeal of risky assets such as Bitcoin. Conversely, weaker data could ease inflation fears and boost risk assets. After October’s jobs report fell short, with only 12,000 jobs added (compared to a forecast of 100,000), expectations for November are bullish . Beyond the labor market, historical data suggests Bitcoin often dips at the start of each month, followed by a strong rebound. Insights shared by Bitcoin commentary platform Bitcoin Archive in a December 2 X post , this trend has persisted for six months. December appears to follow suit, with BTC retreating to trade near $95,000 after approaching the $100,000 mark. Such short-lived corrections may present investment opportunities. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Bitcoin to start parabolic run Despite the bearish sentiment at the start of December, historical price trends indicate that this month could also signal the beginning of a parabolic move for Bitcoin. In this case, decentralized finance ( DeFi ) researcher CryptoNobler suggested that this December might usher in Bitcoin’s largest bull run yet, with conditions resembling the rallies of 2016 and 2020. Key drivers of this optimism include expected pro-Bitcoin policies in the United States, anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, a potential reversal of China’s cryptocurrency ban, and a $16 billion FTX payout scheduled for early 2025. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: CryptoNobler Overall, Bitcoin’s trajectory toward a new record high appears to have stalled. The asset is striving to hold the $95,000 support level to keep the $100,000 target within reach. This pullback has prompted figures like author and investor Robert Kiyosaki to caution about a potential crash to $60,000, which he views as an accumulation opportunity. Bitcoin price analysis Bitcoin was trading at $95,730 at press time, showing daily and weekly losses of 1.5% and 1.9%, respectively. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold On a technical level, Bitcoin remains well-positioned for an upside move, supported by its position above the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages ( SMA ). However, caution is warranted, as the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) of 67 and the Fear & Greed Index of 80 (Extreme Greed) suggest the market may be nearing overbought conditions.

The SARs allow EVO Fund to purchase company shares starting December 16 at a unit price of 614 yen. Metaplanet has also issued bonds valued at 1.75 billion yen , approximately $11.3 million, to fund its Bitcoin purchases. These bonds, guaranteed by the company’s director, offer an annual interest rate of 0.36% and are set to mature in November 2025. The announcement of the shareholder reward program has also impacted Metaplanet’s stock performance. Following the news, the company’s shares surged by 1.17%, reaching 2337 yen.

However, as the price slows, it is uncertain whether ADA will continue the uptrend, and the Cardano whales are switching to a new opportunity – the PropiChain token presale . The whales are flocking to acquire PCHAIN before the price hikes in the next round, hoping to capture up to 8,000x returns by holding the token at the lowest price. Cardano (ADA) The Cardano price has been rallying for three weeks after breaking out of a four-month-long sideways price action. With this rally, the price gained over 250% to reach the high of $1.155 on 23 November 2024. However, probably due to Cardano whales selling, ADA dropped over 24% yesterday to reach the low of $0.8747. In the last 24 hours, Cardano has dropped over 2.4%, currently at $0.9602. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 73, declining steadily as prices correct. The price has taken support from its 10-day SMA, and today’s candlestick is a doji, indicating uncertainty among traders. However, since the price has bounced from the 10-day SMA and the RSI is coming out of the overbought region, ADA might continue its uptrend. Given this price uncertainty, let’s see why the Cardano whales are heading to the PCHAIN token presale. PropiChain: Trade Real Estate On AI-Powered Platform PropiChain is an RWA (Real World Asset) trading platform transforming the real estate industry with its creative combination of blockchain, AI, and the Metaverse. It aims to address all the issues investors face when dealing with properties using its various features. It has brought the entire global real estate sector to the blockchain by slicing the properties into small parts and tokenizing them. The tokens represent tiny portions of real estate, providing a fractional ownership model to PropiChain users. PropiChain uses the fractional model to promote frequent transactions, thus improving liquidity. Unlike traditional real estate, where investors' capital is locked for extended periods, users can quickly find buyers to sell their assets and use the capital received to diversify according to their needs. The Metaverse is another feature that helps PropiChain users gain an advantage. It generates a highly detailed 3D render of all real estate, which users can use to get an immersive virtual experience of their dream properties and assess their investments without traveling and from the comfort of their homes. The platform's AI provides users with many more advantages over conventional investors. Users can access AI chatbots and virtual assistants 24/7 to get their queries answered and assistance with smoothly navigating formalities like complex paperwork and legal documents. The AI further assists by automating property transactions. The users are only required to set the specific valuation at which they want to purchase real estate. After the condition is set, the AI tracks the property and automatically executes the order when the valuation is hit. PropiChain users have more automation opportunities through the platform’s smart contracts. These can create lease agreements without manual paperwork or legal assistance. Smart contracts automatically trigger the lease when the tenant transfers the funds to the landlord and both parties sign the document. Tenants may also use smart contracts to automate monthly rental payments. They can set the date and amount to be transferred and free themselves of this redundant task. Moreover, the landlord can set a fixed penalty for late payments. Thus, smart contracts provide peace of mind to both parties. PropiChain’s native token, PCHAIN , is crucial to the platform’s proper functioning. It is currently in the first stage of the token presale. Let’s analyze the potential returns of PCHAIN and learn how to take advantage of this presale. Why Are Cardano Whales Betting on the PCHAIN Token Presale? If the Cardano rally continues and the price can reach the ATH of $3.10, it would generate a 221% return for those who invest right now. However, the Cardano whales are confident that the PCHAIN token presale will outperform this potential ADA rally. Currently, PCHAIN is available at the lowest price of $0.004 in the first presale stage. Its value will soon surge to $0.011 in the next stage and will hit $0.023 in the third stage. So, investors will get a 175% return by the second stage, which will become a 475% return by the third stage. After the token presale, PCHAIN is expected to launch at $0.032, so stage one holders will receive an 800% return by launch. Moreover, experts have predicted that PCHAIN will ride the next crypto bull run to reach enormous heights and provide up to 8,000x returns for early investors. Conclusion As they sense market indecision, Cardano whales exit their positions to invest in PropiChain before the token surges in the next round. PropiChain is revolutionizing real estate with its advanced investment platform, which incorporates blockchain, AI, and the Metaverse to give users an advantage over conventional investors. AI simplifies property investment, smart contracts automate leasing, and the Metaverse breaks geographical barriers. Regarding user safety, BlockAudit guarantees PropiChain’s security and regulatory compliance. They conducted extensive testing and found zero violations and no security vulnerabilities. Moreover, PCHAIN has been listed on CoinMarketCap , achieving a crucial milestone in the roadmap. The listing significantly impacted the token presale in terms of the number of new investors. So, early investors and token holders can expect the project to grow faster and the token presale to reach further rounds soon. PCHAIN can turn a $500 investment in the first stage into $4,000 just by the end of the token presale. However, the Cardano whales are holding PCHAIN to the moon, aiming at 8,000x returns with the next bull run.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-loves-russia-trumprus-solana-memecoin-to-explode-17000-before-exchange-listing-as-shib-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Analysts also highlighted that an RWA project will rally more than most altcoins and deliver a massive 24,900% gain by moving from $0.004 to $1. Which RWA project is the analyst talking about? Let's find out below. Details of Analyst View on Bitcoin and the RWA Project Analysts state that the US Bitcoin strategic reserve that the newly elected president, Donald Trump, is proposing will be a game-changer for Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency space. The US holds over 200,000 Bitcoin worth more than 6 billion US dollars. Once the proposed reserve strategy is implemented, the US government is expected to buy at least 500000 BTC, and this alone can take the price to $150000 for 1 Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin often impacts other projects because as the price increases, the crypto market will get more capital inflow. Therefore, when Bitcoin rallies, altcoins follow, and analysts believe a recently listed RWA project on CoinMarketCap , PropiChain, will deliver the most gains. Right now, PropiChain (PCHAIN), a decentralized real estate marketplace, is going for $0.004 in the first stage of its presale. According to experts' forecasts, the Bitcoin rally to $150000 will see this project move to $1 from $0.004. PCHAIN’s Intrinsic Value in Real Estate that Will Aid its Rally Experts believe the intrinsic value of this project and the new era that the project is pioneering in real estate are among the major reasons it will outperform most altcoins. Hereunder, we will look into some of its offerings in real estate. Liquidity with DeFi Collateralization Liquidity has been a major concern in the real estate sector for years, and this sometimes can be discouraging, especially in times of dire need. Most houses and properties are expensive, and getting buyers can be overwhelming. However, this project eradicates these issues by allowing fractional ownership of assets. Investors only need to pay the required amount to purchase a portion of an asset and open the way for joint ownership. This solves the liquidity issue and opens the industry door to many intending investors. Further, proof of ownership is available on the smart contracts, which means you're assured the transactions are legally binding. PropiChain also enables users to use their portion of a property on PCHAIN as collateral to access more funds. This will help investors stop selling their property at a lower value in dire need. The absence of third parties makes it faster, cheaper, and safer on Propichain’s marketplace. Auto Leasing and Auto-Renewal Rental and Leasing arrangements in the real estate industry are known to be time-consuming and unnecessarily stressful. Busy investors often delegate this task, which will even cost them more. The auto-renewal and auto-leasing arrangement proposed by PropiChain will end this inefficiency. Investors on PropiChain will be able to automate their rental and lease agreements with the help of PropiChain AI. The artificial intelligence will execute the renewal once the terms and the date agreed on the agreement saved smart contract are met. Before reaching an agreement, landlords and tenants can also interact via the integrated Metaverse interactive environment to inspect and conclude their agreements at a convenient time and location. All these attributes will improve compliance and transparency in the 300 trillion-dollar sector. Conclusion Investors can still join the ongoing presale of PropiChain and get it at a discounted price of $0.004. The presale price will increase by more than 270% in the second stage. Therefore, now is the best time to join. The BlockAudit report on the platform further fueled the hype around the project and boosted investors’ confidence. Now is the best time to be part of a project pioneering a new era of real estate.

37137114,https://finbold.com/?p=216337,1733150686,"Crypto trader turns $170 into $435,000 in a month","While far from the wildest cryptocurrency trade of the 2024 bull market , the maneuver executed by an investor who recently turned $169 into $435,000 is nothing to scoff at. Specifically, a crypto trader spent only 1 Solana ( SOL ) – worth approximately $169 at the time – to purchase 19.79 million Salvator Mundi (MUNDI). The trade was also interesting as it was, based on the timing on October 25, triggered by the launch of a meme coin called Ban, but saw the investor resist the ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) surrounding the token that quickly hit a market cap of $60 million. Instead, the trader opted for MUNDI – at the time being valued at a total of $8,500 – and held on to the purchased cryptocurrency for approximately a month. Near the end of November, the digital assets investor offloaded 18.19M Salvator Mundi for 1,428 Solana (~$336.9K), retaining 1.6M MUNDI (~$99K), per the data shared by the blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain on December 1. MUNDI chart with ‘buys’ and ‘sales’ marked. Source: @lookonchain Salvator Mundi is based on a Leonardo Da Vinci painting of the same name , dated to between 1,499 and 1,510 and uses the image as its logo. The painting is itself interesting as it was considered for some time to be a copy of a lost original, and it is, to this day, disputed whether the famous polymath painted it himself in its entirety or if only some of the elements are his. Meme coins remain the most high risk-high reward play of 2024 In general, art-related meme coins have spawned multiple ‘overnight’ cryptocurrency millionaires. For example, Finbold reported on November 27 that a trader who spent only 0.75 SOL on the Just a chill guy (CHILLGUY) meme coin achieved a staggering 38,399x return, turning $160 into $6 million. Though the token has generated one incredible ‘rags to riches’ story, it is dubious if such a maneuver can be replicated since the artist behind the image that became the Chill Guy meme – Phillip Banks – warned the illustration is protected and threatened legal action against any digital asset projects that use it. The fate of another art-related meme coin – FRIC (FRIC) – could have more staying power as it was launched by the South Korean artist dricstudio themself. The cryptocurrency not only generated at least one new millionaire by November 25, but the journey from $6,300 to $1.5 million was made in one hour , as reported by Finbold. Finally, it is worth pointing out that despite the meme coin space being filled with stories of investors swiftly turning hundreds or thousands into millions, it remains an exceptionally risky section of the already-risky cryptocurrency market. For example, a Binance report from early November found that 97% of all meme coins ever made ‘have died,’ showcasing the extreme danger for traders.

BTC experienced its largest pullback since the US elections, with an 8.64 percent intra-week decline to $90,911, before swiftly rebounding and delivering a record-breaking monthly close at $96,506. Bitcoin ended November with an impressive 37.3 percent gain, making it the second-best month so far of 2024. This stellar performance continues to underscore Bitcoin’s robust momentum, positioning it well as we enter December. Historically, December has been a volatile month for Bitcoin, but in halving years, the asset has delivered exceptional average returns of 38.86 percent. Given the current bull market dynamics, we believe Bitcoin is poised for further gains, albeit with potential short-term volatility. Any short-term pullbacks are likely to be triggered by ETF outflows and Long-Term Holder (LTH) profit-taking. Last week, ETFs registered net outflows of $135.1 million, with the bulk of these taking place during the first two trading days. LTHs have distributed a significant 508,990 BTC since September, increasing the supply entering the market. While this remains below the 934,000 BTC distributed before the March 2024 highs, the continued selling pressure requires sustained demand from ETFs and marginal buyers to avoid further pullbacks. Interestingly, Short Term Holder (STH) supply is nearing its cycle high of 3,282,000 BTC. Historically, the final phase of a bull market begins when STH supply breaches pre-halving cycle highs. This shift indicates increasing retail participation but also highlights the market’s reliance on incoming demand to absorb LTH profit-taking. As Bitcoin transitions further into its bull market cycle, the current consolidation phase serves as a necessary pause for absorbing profit-taking and realigning market demand. With strong ETF inflows resuming and increasing retail interest, we believe Bitcoin remains well-positioned to break through the psychological $100,000 barrier. The US economy also displayed resilience in late 2024, driven by strong consumer spending, steady labour market growth, and moderated inflation expectations – though challenges still persist. In October, consumer spending rose 0.4 percent alongside a 0.6 percent increase in income, while inflation climbed modestly , with core PCE up 2.8 percent year-over-year. Business investment showed mixed signals, as durable goods orders rose slightly, and GDP growth held steady at 2.8 percent in the third quarter, supported by strong wages and near-record corporate profits. November consumer confidence hit a 16-month high , driven by labour market optimism and falling inflation expectations, which declined to 4.9 percent. However, uncertainty remains over inflationary pressures from the incoming Trump administration’s policies. Despite these challenges, robust consumer activity and labour market strength are expected to sustain economic momentum into the year-end. Hong Kong’s push for innovation in digital finance, Celsius Network’s bankruptcy resolution efforts, and regulatory changes in Russia were in the crypto headlines last week, as stablecoins also continued to gain prominence. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the Digital Bond Grant Scheme, offering subsidies of up to HK$2.5 million per issuance to promote tokenised bonds, strengthening Hong Kong’s position as a hub for virtual assets. Meanwhile, Celsius Network initiated its second $127 million payout to creditors, advancing its bankruptcy proceedings. At the same time, its former CEO faces ongoing legal challenges, underscoring the complexities of corporate accountability in the sector. In Russia, a new law recognising digital currencies as property and exempting crypto mining from VAT marks a significant step in regulatory clarity, aiming to balance growth in the digital asset market with structured taxation and compliance. Simultaneously, the stablecoin market reached a record $190 billion market capitalisation, with Tether’s USDt accounting for 70 percent of the total. Driven by cross-border payment efficiency and adoption by traditional financial firms like Stripe and PayPal, stablecoins are solidifying their role in mainstream finance. These developments highlight the interplay of innovation, regulation, and market dynamics shaping the cryptocurrency industry. Have a good trading week!

This acquisition brings the company’s total holdings to 172 Bitcoin ( BTC ), valued at $15.8 million, with an average purchase price of $92,006 per Bitcoin, according to a company press release . The move follows Genius Group’s earlier commitment to allocate at least 90% of its reserves to Bitcoin, aiming for an initial treasury target of $120 million. The firm, which integrates AI solutions into education, views Bitcoin as a cornerstone of its financial strategy. CEO Roger Hamilton has likened the company’s approach to other publicly traded firms adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset, citing its potential as a “store of value” in the digital economy. Genius Group’s “Bitcoin-first” strategy aligns with its broader plans to incorporate blockchain into its AI-powered educational platforms. These plans include on-chain certifications and rewards systems leveraging Bitcoin’s Lightning Network.

37137226,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=621508,1733150484,Joe Biden should be embarrassed of the economic legacy he’s leaving behind,"Joe Biden’s presidency is wrapping up, and the economic disaster he’s leaving behind speaks louder than any speech he’s ever given. Inflation is at record highs, wages are failing to keep up, and Americans are drowning in debt. Biden promised a stronger, more resilient economy. Instead, he delivered policies that left families scrambling to make ends meet while the national debt soared to levels that make Wall Street nervous. Critics across the spectrum have blasted his economic agenda, from his handling of inflation to the reckless spending sprees that define his administration. This is the perfect time to call it:- The legacy of Bidenomics is a full-blown embarrassment. Inflation, wages, and the painful cost of living Let’s start with inflation, the silent thief robbing Americans blind under Biden’s watch. By June 2022, inflation reached 9.1%, the highest since 1981. Prices on everything from groceries to gas have skyrocketed, with an overall increase of nearly 20% since he took office. For the average American household, this means an extra $17,000 sucked out of their wallets each year. Wages have been another disaster. Sure, nominal wages have gone up, but what good is a bigger paycheck when it buys less? Real wages — what people actually earn after adjusting for inflation — have dropped by 4% since January 2021. The situation has driven many Americans to rely on credit cards just to get by. Total household debt has exploded by 21%, with credit card debt alone hitting a record $1.12 trillion. These aren’t numbers you spin into a “win for the economy.” This is what economic failure looks like. And while inflation raged, growth fizzled. GDP growth was a relatively strong 3.4% at the end of 2023, but by early 2024, it had plummeted to 1.4%. Economists have said that Biden’s spending habits and lack of fiscal discipline have done more harm than good, pushing the economy closer to stagnation. But do they really have to? The government has sent an unfathomable amount of money in aid to countries like Ukraine and Israel with absolutely nothing to show for it. They’ve poured billions into initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the CHIPS Act, but where are the results? These programs promised a manufacturing renaissance, with nearly $400 billion allocated to green industries and semiconductor production. Yet, most of the projects funded are still under construction, and the benefits haven’t reached American workers. Manufacturing construction spending hit $238 billion in June 2024, double what it was two years ago, but the jobs and tangible benefits remain largely theoretical. Meanwhile, servicing the national debt now costs more than the country spends on national defense. How crazy is that? Energy policies and supply chain chaos Energy costs are another sore spot. Biden’s regulatory policies have piled costs onto small businesses and pushed energy prices higher. The administration’s decisions have driven up production costs across industries, leaving companies and consumers footing the bill. Supply chain disruptions, exacerbated by these policies, have led to empty shelves and inflated prices for basic goods. Take the lithium industry as an example. Biden’s IRA promised to encourage domestic production of key materials like lithium, critical for electric vehicle batteries. But Albemarle, the world’s largest lithium producer, recently paused a $1.3 billion refining project in South Carolina. Why? The costs were too high, and federal support didn’t arrive as promised. This is just one of many examples where Biden’s policies created more problems than they solved. Public sentiment turns against Biden and his Party Unsurprisingly, consumer confidence in Biden and the Democrats has tanked. Poll after poll shows Americans are fed up with the current state of the economy. For many, the rising costs of living and lack of economic progress are driving their discontent. We saw this frustration show up at the ballot box when they gave Republican Donald Trump a landslide win against his opponent, the sitting Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump has vowed to dismantle most of Biden’s initiatives, calling the IRA in particular a “green new scam” and criticizing the CHIPS Act as wasteful. Congressional Republicans have made more than 50 attempts to repeal the IRA since it was enacted, and now, with Trump back in power, those efforts may succeed. The irony is hard to ignore. Most of the manufacturing investments sparked by Biden’s policies have gone to Republican-controlled districts. Roughly 65% of the projects announced since the IRA and CHIPS Act are located in counties that voted for Trump in 2020. These same areas are now reaping the benefits of policies their representatives oppose.

37137001,https://crypto.news/?p=14315473,1733150449,Mantra price chart pattern points to a strong breakout soon,"Mantra price has declined in recent days, entering a local bear market with a 30% drop from its all-time high. Mantra ( OM ) token was trading at $3.54, bringing its market cap to over $3.28 billion. It has become the 45th biggest crypto in the industry. Mantra’s recent decline pales in comparison to its strong performance this year, as it has jumped by 10,758%. It has also become one of the best cryptocurrencies for yield-focused investors. According to StakingRewards , it has a yield of about 30%, making it one of the biggest yielders in the crypto industry. The 30% yield means that a $1,000 investment in the coin will bring in about $300 a year, all factors constant. That is a higher reward than other popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ). It is also much higher than what US government bonds and popular dividend ETFs are offering. You might also like: Here’s why XRP price surged and 3 reasons it may crash soon Mantra’s surge is because the developers are aiming to disrupt the Real World Asset tokenization industry, which has a multi-trillion dollar potential. They recently launched Mantra Chain, a layer-1 network made specifically for the tokenization industry. Analysts believe that the RWA tokenization sector could be a game changer in the crypto industry. For example, tokenized funds by companies like Blackrock and Franklin Templeton have achieved almost $1 billion in assets. According to Statista , assets worth over $30 trillion will be tokenized by 2030. Mantra hopes to be the blockchain used for this tokenization. Mantra price could be ripe for a strong breakout OM price chart | Source: crypto.news Technicals suggest that the OM price could be on the cusp of a strong bullish breakout in the next few days. On the daily chart, the coin formed a golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages. Mantra coin has remained above these averages. Also, it has formed a bullish flag chart pattern, which is made up of a vertical line and a consolidation pattern. Most notably, it has formed a falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish reversal pattern. A falling wedge is a pattern made up of two falling and converging trendlines. Therefore, with the wedge nearing its confluence pattern, there are signs that the Mantra price will have a strong bullish breakout. If this happens, the next point to watch will be at $4.5150, its highest point last month, which is about 28% above the current level. A drop below the support at $3 will point to more downside.

Here Are the Details","The United States could see rapid progress on cryptocurrency regulation under President-elect Donald Trump, according to Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad. Coinbase Policy Head Predicts Rapid Crypto Regulation Under Trump Administration Shirzad expressed optimism that crypto-friendly legislation backed by a Republican-controlled Congress will move forward quickly after Trump takes office in January. Shirzad emphasized that Trump's strong pro-crypto stance and the GOP's majority in both the House and Senate are crucial to advancing the legislation. “We have the most pro-crypto Congress in history, and we have an extraordinarily pro-crypto president coming into office,” Shirzad said at an event in the UK hosted by Coinbase-backed advocacy group Stand With Crypto. With over 50 million Americans owning cryptocurrencies, Shirzad believes the alignment of pro-crypto leadership will ensure their voices are finally heard in policymaking. Two critical bills are currently under consideration: Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act: A Republican-backed bill that aims to create a comprehensive legal framework for digital assets. This bill has already passed the House of Representatives. Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act: This bill, which focuses on licensing stablecoin issuers, has not yet been voted on in the House of Representatives. While Shirzad acknowledged that the chances of passing these bills during the post-election “lame duck” session are slim, he expects significant progress in 2025. *This is not investment advice.

37137094,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24502,1733150393,Liệu Meme Coin đã đi quá xa?,"Chuyện là thế này, có một nền tảng meme coin trên Solana tên là Pump.fun, cho phép người dùng tạo meme coin và… livestream. Nghe thì có vẻ hay ho, nhưng hóa ra lại thành thảm họa. Mọi người bắt đầu làm những trò lố lăng trên livestream để câu kéo sự chú ý cho đồng coin của họ, nào là giả vờ tự tử, dọa đánh nhau, thậm chí còn có cả dọa khủng bố trường học! Cộng đồng crypto dậy sóng, Pump.fun phải tạm dừng tính năng livestream vô thời hạn và hứa hẹn sẽ cải thiện hệ thống kiểm duyệt nội dung. Câu chuyện này cho thấy sự khó khăn trong việc cân bằng giữa tự do và trách nhiệm trên các nền tảng phi tập trung. Làm sao để vừa quản lý nội dung do người dùng tạo ra, vừa giữ được bản chất phi tập trung của nền tảng? Bài toán nan giải đây! Sự hỗn loạn từ livestream Ban đầu, Pump.fun tạo ra tính năng livestream với mục đích tốt đẹp là để các nhà sáng tạo quảng bá token của họ. Ai ngờ đâu, nó lại trở thành nơi để người ta thi nhau làm những trò điên rồ, thậm chí nguy hiểm để câu view. Cao trào là vụ một người dùng giả vờ tự tử trên livestream để “pr” cho meme coin của mình. Dù sau đó được xác nhận là trò lừa, nhưng nó cũng đủ gióng lên hồi chuông cảnh báo về sự nguy hiểm của việc thiếu kiểm duyệt. Trước làn sóng phẫn nộ, Pump.fun đã phải tắt tính năng livestream và cam kết sẽ xem xét lại hệ thống kiểm duyệt. Tuy nhiên, nhiều người vẫn hoài nghi về khả năng kiểm soát nội dung hiệu quả của nền tảng này. Meme Coin – Mặt tối của thị trường Crypto? Meme coin ban đầu xuất hiện với mục đích vui vẻ là chính, như Dogecoin chẳng hạn. Nhưng rồi mọi thứ dần biến tướng, trở thành một mảnh đất màu mỡ cho những trò lừa đảo, thao túng và hành vi phi đạo đức. Người ta chỉ quan tâm đến lợi nhuận nhanh chóng mà bất chấp tất cả. Một trong những vấn đề nhức nhối nhất là “rug pull” – các nhà phát triển có thể “cuỗm tiền bỏ trốn” sau khi đã huy động đủ vốn, khiến nhà đầu tư ôm một đống token vô giá trị. Pump.fun lại càng tiếp tay cho những trò bẩn này bằng cách cho phép người dùng quảng bá token bằng mọi giá. Tóm lại là, meme coin đang dần đánh mất đi bản chất ban đầu của nó – một cộng đồng vui vẻ, sáng tạo và đề cao tinh thần hợp tác. Thay vào đó là sự tham lam, lừa lọc và cạnh tranh không lành mạnh. Cộng đồng Meme Coin có thể tự kiểm soát? Để giải quyết những vấn đề trên, cần có sự kết hợp giữa tự điều chỉnh, giáo dục cộng đồng và tăng cường minh bạch. Các dự án meme coin cần thiết lập những quy tắc đạo đức rõ ràng, các nền tảng như Pump.fun cần có chính sách kiểm duyệt nội dung nghiêm ngặt. Bên cạnh đó, việc giáo dục cộng đồng về rủi ro khi đầu tư vào meme coin cũng rất quan trọng. Các nhà phát triển dự án cần minh bạch hơn về thông tin, lộ trình và đội ngũ của mình. Cuối cùng, việc xây dựng một văn hóa tích cực trong cộng đồng meme coin là điều then chốt. Hãy tập trung vào sự sáng tạo, hài hước và tinh thần cộng đồng thay vì chỉ chạy theo lợi nhuận. Tóm lại là: Meme coin đang đứng trước ngã ba đường. Nếu không được kiểm soát, nó sẽ trở thành “con sâu làm rầu nồi canh” của thị trường crypto. Ngược lại, nếu có sự chung tay góp sức của cả cộng đồng, meme coin hoàn toàn có thể lấy lại được hình ảnh tích cực và phát triển bền vững.

One such investor, who famously turned a modest Ripple (XRP) stake into millions, is now sharing insights on what could be the next big crypto surge . While Ripple’s rise was driven by its focus on cross-border payments, the investor believes the future lies in innovation that bridges multiple technological realms—and one name stands out: Lightchain AI . Why This Investor Believes Lightchain AI Is the Next Big Thing Lightchain AI is garnering attention for its ability to integrate blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI). Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, Lightchain AI focuses on practical utility by leveraging its proprietary Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism. This revolutionary approach rewards participants for meaningful AI computations, such as machine learning and data analysis, rather than just validating transactions. Key Reasons for the Prediction: AI Meets Blockchain: Lightchain AI’s unique platform addresses the growing demand for decentralized AI applications, setting it apart from other projects. Early-Stage Opportunity: Still in its presale phase, Lightchain AI presents an entry point for investors looking to capitalize on a market disruptor before its full potential is realized. Strong Growth Potential: By targeting industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics, Lightchain AI taps into multi-billion-dollar markets poised for rapid expansion. The investor highlights Lightchain AI’s technological innovation as a critical factor in its potential to replicate or even surpass Ripple’s explosive growth.

The company submitted the application today, indicating that the fund, dubbed WisdomTree XRP Fund, would grant investors exposure to XRP. The development comes days after the company submitted a preliminary filing in the State of Delaware, seeking to launch an exchange-traded product tied to XRP. The company has taken another major step as it officially seeks the SEC’s blessings for the XRP ETF .https://twitter.com/thecryptobasic/status/1863569419731120232WisdomTree XRP ETF Application According to the filing, the WisdomTree XRP ETF shares will be listed and traded on the Cboe BZX Exchange under an undisclosed ticker. While WisdomTree Digital Commodity Service will serve as the trust’s sponsor, New York’s oldest bank, BNY Mellon, is the fund's administrator.The system will derive the value of the shares daily using an independent reference rate that sources its rate from XRP’s spot prices on major trading platforms.Additionally, WisdomTree will redeem or create the trust’s shares in blocks of 5,000 Shares in exchange for cash. Currently, WisdomTree has yet to specify certain details, such as the reference rate, ticker, and price of each share. Top Asset Managers Seeking to Launch XRP ETFs For context, WisdomTree’s filing marks the fourth application the SEC has received for an ETF exclusively tied to XRP. Prior to this filing, top asset managers like Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Capital had submitted similar applications for XRP. Additionally, leading asset managers such as Grayscale Investments and Bitwise are also seeking to convert their multi-coin funds, which contain cryptos like XRP, to spot exchange-traded products (ETPs). While the SEC has acknowledged the applications for the XRP-related basket ETPs, the regulator has yet to comment on filings exclusively on XRP. Potential Settlement of SEC v. Ripple Lawsuit These asset managers seek to launch different investment products around XRP despite the token’s involvement in the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit, which is currently in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The appeal, which will fully commence in January 2025, will see the parties challenge a federal court ruling regarding Ripple’s past XRP sales. While the SEC seeks to overturn the decisions on Ripple’s programmatic sales and other distributions of XRP, the company challenged the institutional sales ruling, which was deemed investment contracts. Before the U.S. election, several legal analysts, including Fred Rispoli, projected that the Second Circuit would issue its verdict in 2026. However, following Donald Trump’s emergence as U.S. President-elect, there are speculations that his administration would pave the way for favorable regulations, potentially leading to the resolution of the lawsuit. This speculation gained momentum after Gary Gensler announced plans to resign as SEC Chair on January 20, 2025. Consequently, XRP has skyrocketed tremendously as more rumors about a potential settlement of the lawsuit emerge. Specifically, the price of XRP spiked over 300% in one month, hitting a six-year high of $2.49 today. XRP also reclaimed the third position after its market cap overtook that of Solana (SOL) and Tether (USDT). At press time, XRP trades at $2.4, ranking as the third-biggest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $136.6 billion.",POSITIVE,XRP,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/02/wisdomtree-officially-seeks-sec-permission-to-launch-xrp-etf-in-the-us/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wisdomtree-officially-seeks-sec-permission-to-launch-xrp-etf-in-the-us,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

37136640,https://blockworks.co/news/altcoin-market-returns-against-btc,1733149347,How close is crypto to massive altcoin returns?,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . When Covid rolled across the world — bringing about lockdowns and meme stocks — we all took the news of swans and dolphins reclaiming Venice canals as a positive sign. Perhaps the whole ordeal had a silver lining. A moment for the natural world to stretch its wings and humans to reassess their consumption habits. Sadly, it was fake news . There were no dolphins in Venice canals and global coal output has ramped up after the pandemic. The Earth never really made it any closer to returning to its original state. Nearly five years later, crypto is currently on the lookout for its own fake dolphin news. A signal that altcoin season will actually return at scale, and massive returns along with it. Maybe it’s XRP flipping SOL as markets briefly rotate out of AI and memecoins. “Altcoin season” as a concept has, however, been diluted in the waiting. The definition used here in the Empire newsletter is a conservative one, meant to reserve the label for periods in which returns are both sustained and enormous. And we’re indeed getting closer. Blue columns in the background show the relative performance of altcoins vs. bitcoin — up means altcoins beat bitcoin and vice versa Altcoin season: When the market cap growth of altcoins — as represented by everything outside of the top 10 — eclipses bitcoin’s since the bottom of the cycle for three months or more. So, altcoin season can potentially start when the purple line on the chart above surpasses the orange line. As that happens fairly often, altcoin season is only properly confirmed once it has beaten bitcoin for capitalization growth over an extended period — when the altcoin pumps are real enough to retain it all. It’s a retrospective model. Running it back gives three distinct altcoin seasons since 2016, and the latest ended when the previous bull run topped out in November 2021, lasting a year and a half. That’s now 1,118 days ago, the longest gap by far. Here’s the good news: The altcoin market just posted its best weekly performance (rolling basis) against bitcoin for this entire cycle, which started in November 2022. BTC’s market cap shrunk by 0.3% while the altcoin market (minus the top 10) grew by 13.9% — a difference of 14.2%. During the previous bull market (2018 to 2021), altcoin’s relative performance topped out at 17.7% in the middle of altcoin season (green area) From here, the capitalization of altcoins would only need to rise by around 20% for our first condition to be met, with bitcoin trading sideways. Sounds like a lot. But the altcoin market has more than doubled in the past five weeks alone. Crypto is healing. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

37136516,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=621523,1733149297,Top-performing altcoins from previous bull cycles dominate social media mindshare,"The mindshare of XRP and older altcoins has grown significantly in the last 24 hours. This time around, the list includes older coins and tokens, re-entering consideration after the meme craze. Kaito’s mindshare metric is one of the timely indicators measuring social media exposure for all assets. The XRP rally coincided with the biggest daily gains in social media mindshare. However, XRP was not the only asset from older bull markets to gain interest. Several coins and tokens grew their mindshare, knocking off meme token stars. While peak attention remains focused on Solana (SOL), former gainers like Avalanche (AVAX), Hedera (HBAR), and Litecoin (LTC) have also seen revivals. Still, all of these tokens had a weaker mindshare compared to XRP. XRP is currently ranked 1st for mindshare. Yes, you read that correctly. pic.twitter.com/bSKheApH5C — Kaito AI 🌊 (@_kaitoai) December 2, 2024 There is no consensus on which narrative will emerge as the most appealing for investors, but older tokens show they can still rally in a way similar to meme assets. In contrast, former social media star Popcat (POPCAT) saw its sentiment measure diminish, with its mindshare metric shrinking in the red for the first time in five months. The latest shift of attention to older altcoins follows a recent focus on AI agents and AI content accounts. The move into “dinosaur altcoins” shows a taste for risk for any and all coins and tokens, with the expectation of briefly outperforming BTC. Sentiment shifts closer to altcoin season In 2024, the focus on meme tokens caused speculation that some assets would never recover their previous highs, or even rally again. However, the biggest gainers since the US Presidential election rally were the most unexpected coins and tokens. In addition to XRP, the biggest gainers also included tokens with large communities and established cults of followers over the years. The list of projects includes Stellar (XLM), Algorand (ALGO), Hedera (HBAR), Cardano (ADA), and even IOTA. Those projects all had triple-digit gains since November 6, far outperforming the 37% gains for BTC. The recent rally for the so-called “dinosaur altcoins” showed the main volumes are flowing into XRP, XLM, ADA, and a handful of other assets. If these coins and tokens begin to slide, the earnings may roll over to another batch of altcoins and tokens. The projects on the list had ambitious goals of onboarding businesses, finance services, or serving as the platform for the Internet of Things (IOTA). While most of the promises remained unfulfilled, those platforms also retained their long-term true believers. Altcoin season index just below cut-off line The rising mindshare for older altcoins coincides with the growing altcoin season index. The index measures how much the top 100 altcoins and tokens outperform BTC. The index took a week to rally from under 50 points to 73 points on December 2. The altcoin season index has a cut-off of 75 points to announce the official cut-off level. The altcoin season is on the verge of being officially announced after the index breaks above 75 points. | Source: Altcoin Season Index The index growth also coincided with an uptick in Google searches for “altcoin season.” Interest grew from 4 points in October to 100 points in December, as hopes for more actively growing assets increased. The altcoin “buy” signal based on Dune Analytics data is also pointing to a cautious expectation for outperforming BTC. Altcoin season traditionally follows a BTC all-time high and subsequent lowering of BTC’s dominance. Just days after achieving peak dominance, BTC fell to 55.8% of the total crypto market capitalization. The conditions seem to align for an altcoin rally, as trading volumes shifted to other markets. The appeal of altcoins is in their well-established status and liquid listings. For now, even the best outperforming meme tokens only last for a few days. Altcoins, on the other hand, have gone through a long period of accumulation, and are starting to form vertical rallies. One of the setbacks for altcoins may be long-term holders turning into sellers after waiting for years to breakeven or make a profit. An altcoin season may only last a few months, but it is a risky and active time for trading. Before altcoins started their vertical trajectory, attention also turned to other sources of growth. NFT and NFT markets increased their mindshare. Tokenless projects with the potential for an airdrop also received more social media mentions.

If Trump's Bitcoin Strategic Reserve plan is implemented, Bitcoin could reach $400,000 per coin within five years due to increased demand. Establishing a Bitcoin reserve would be relatively simple, leveraging the 200,000+ Bitcoin the US government already holds from seizures. Long term, Bitcoin could reach $1.5-2 million per coin in 10-15 years, making it a valuable part of a diversified investment portfolio. Thesis If Donald Trump's plan to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve is implemented and other countries quickly follow suit, it would significantly increase overall demand for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and associated investment options like the iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ). This could make Bitcoin worth $400,000 per coin within the next 5 years. Trump's Policy Positions on Crypto Trump used to be vocally anti-crypto; as recently as 2019, he tweeted that he was ""not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air."" However, Trump reversed course during his presidential campaign this year. Although he didn't mention cryptocurrency in any of the 15 high-level policy positions on his website, his campaign accepted cryptocurrency donations and he frequently made pro-crypto statements. Most notably, he gave the keynote speech at the Bitcoin Conference in July, where he promised to make the USA the ""crypto capital of the planet."" More specific ideas mentioned by Trump and his advisors include broadly de-regulating the industry by firing anti-crypto regulators like SEC chair Gary Gensler, creating a pro-crypto advisory council within the government, and potentially eliminating capital gains taxes on cryptocurrencies issued by USA companies. These ideas are exciting for the crypto industry more broadly, and I plan to cover them in future articles. However, none of these ideas are likely to have much impact on Bitcoin, which even Gary Gensler admits is a decentralized commodity that has no issuer and is already loosely regulated. The policy proposal that's most interesting for Bitcoin investors is the creation of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, which is the focus of this article. US Government Reserves The US government keeps reserves of key commodities such as gold and oil. The oil reserve serves the functional purpose of smoothing out supply shocks. For example, the government will release oil reserves when it believes that oil prices are too high and add to the reserves by purchasing oil when prices are relatively lower. The reason for having a gold reserve is more nuanced. At one point, the US dollar was backed by gold, so the government had to have gold in order to allow citizens to exchange their gold-backed dollars for real gold. Although the dollar is no longer backed by gold, the government still holds substantial gold reserves. This is because gold is a scarce and inflation-resistant asset that has historically retained value better than fiat money. Having gold as part of a diversified balance sheet protects the nation's financial position in a variety of economic conditions. For example, the government is able to get huge loans at favorable rates in part because its financial stability is backed up by gold reserves and other assets besides USD. Even if the world abruptly abandoned the USD as a global currency, the government would theoretically still be able to use its gold and other assets to pay down debt. Other countries also have gold reserves for similar reasons, so to some degree it's also a standoff. No politician wants to be the one to sell off their country's reserves, only to watch gold's price increase later. The Case for a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Trump has proposed creating a Bitcoin reserve similar to the existing gold reserve. Senator Cynthia Lummis already introduced a bill called the BITCOIN Act to achieve this last July, but it hasn't been passed yet. The proposed bill would have the US Treasury purchase 1 million Bitcoin (~5% of Bitcoin's total supply) over 5 years, and then hold the coins for at least 20 years or use them to pay down federal debt. The case for creating this reserve is largely similar to the case for maintaining the gold reserve. In order to secure the nation's financial position in a wider variety of scenarios, the government should diversify its assets to include some Bitcoin. Just like gold, Bitcoin is a decentralized and inflation-resistant asset that might retain value better than USD in some cases. While having a Bitcoin reserve and a gold reserve may seem redundant, Bitcoin has some unique properties relative to gold. This includes the ability to be transferred over the internet (portability), better divisibility, a soon-to-be lower supply inflation rate, and historically faster price appreciation. In some situations, such as a temporary outage in digital USD settlement systems, these properties would make Bitcoin more useful than gold. Just as governments want to ensure that their nation has its fair share of the gold supply (and its fair share of critical industries like semiconductors, car manufacturing, etc.), they should also try to ensure that they get their fair share of the limited Bitcoin supply. After all, Bitcoin is already one of the 10 most valuable assets in the world , and an increasingly important part of global wealth and monetary systems. The Logistics of Creating the Reserve Top Bitcoin holders November 2024 (River.com) Some may be surprised to learn that the U.S. Government is already the world's 7th largest Bitcoin holder. It acquired Bitcoin by seizing assets in criminal investigations, most famously seizing over 100,000 Bitcoin from a combination of the online black market The Silk Road and the hackers of the Bitfinex crypto exchange. Historically, the government has slowly sold off Bitcoin after acquiring it, but that hasn't stopped it from holding some Bitcoin for over 10 years, effectively maintaining an informal reserve. In this sense, establishing an official reserve is actually quite simple; the government would just declare the 200,000+ currently held Bitcoin as a formal reserve and stop selling it. This reserve would only be about 1/5th the size of the 1 million coin reserve proposed in the BITCOIN Act, but it would be a relatively uncontroversial start. At current Bitcoin prices (~$100,000), acquiring an additional 800,000 Bitcoin wouldn't be unreasonably expensive or risky for a country as large as the USA. The resulting $0.1 trillion allocation would still be a drop in the bucket relative to the government's estimated $200 trillion in total assets, $0.6 trillion in gold reserves, and $4.4 trillion in annual revenue. Even if Bitcoin prices significantly declined after the reserve was established, it wouldn't have much impact on the USA's overall financial position. Better Now Than Later As mentioned above, Bitcoin is still a relatively small asset compared to the USA's vast wealth and tax revenue. However, the logistics of funding the reserve are still somewhat complex, and they will become more complex if Bitcoin's market cap continues to increase. The BITCOIN bill proposes funding the reserve with USD from Federal Reserve banks, essentially rebalancing the nation's assets to be lighter on USD and heavier on Bitcoin. However, the bill doesn't provide details on what to do if Bitcoin's price continues rising during the 5-year purchase period. Even from current Bitcoin prices (which are substantially higher than when the bill was introduced in July), I model that the proposal in the bill would only be sufficient to fund purchases of 400,000 Bitcoin (instead of the proposed 800,000+). If Bitcoin's price continues to rise, some later purchases may require funding from more controversial sources such as tax revenue or the sale of other reserves like gold. The least controversial way to address this would be to update the bill to use a fixed amount of USD to purchase Bitcoin each year, instead of using a variable amount of USD to purchase a fixed number of Bitcoin. While that may mean that the USA would fail to acquire 1 million Bitcoin within 5 years, it might make the bill easier to pass and fund. No doubt, other less wealthy countries are doing similar math and feeling a greater degree of urgency to establish their reserves at current prices before the USA begins exerting buying pressure. It's been reported that at least Brazil, Poland, and Russia are considering establishing reserves. El Salvador already has a Bitcoin reserve. Other countries including China and Bhutan own Bitcoin but haven't established formal reserves (similar to the USA's current state). Notably, many of these countries are not allies of the USA, which only adds to the pressure that each country will feel to acquire Bitcoin ahead of rivals. Bitcoin's Updated Price Target Price is a function of supply and demand. If the USA and other countries were to establish strategic reserves of Bitcoin, this would by definition increase demand for Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's supply is fixed at 21 million. As a result, we can conclude that Bitcoin's price is likely to increase if the strategic reserve is established. Demand is difficult to model precisely, and any model has risk of being inaccurate. For my model in this article, I'll predict Bitcoin's demand and price based on a comparison with gold. The inspiration for this comparison is that having 1 million Bitcoin would give the government ownership of about 5% of Bitcoin's supply, which is similar to their ownership of the total mined gold supply ( 3-4% at 8,100 tons). Based on this, I model that other large governments/institutions that own a meaningful portion of the gold supply would quickly follow the USA's lead and aim to purchase a proportional amount of the Bitcoin supply. From this, we can model a couple of scenarios with different price targets: Bear case ($65,000): Strategic reserves aren't established and Bitcoin's price falls back to pre-election levels. It's worth noting that $65,000 is also close to the previous 4-year halving cycle's max price from 2021. Historically, Bitcoin has not meaningfully fallen below the previous cycle's high, so I view $65,000 as a major resistance point that is unlikely to be broken. Bull case ($400,000): Central banks and investors increase demand for Bitcoin until it has the same market cap as gold. Formula: (current BTC price) * (gold market cap) / (Bitcoin market cap) * (% of gold held by investors/central banks) Application: $95,000 * 17.8 / 1.9 * 0.45 = 400,500 (round to 400,000). It's anyone's guess as to which of these cases is more likely. I won't pretend to have inside information about the incoming administration's plans. However, my relatively uninformed guess is that we'll see something along these lines: Bitcoin's price rises to $140,000-$200,000 in 2025 as positive sentiment surrounding the reserve allows the current bull run to continue. The reserve takes longer than expected to implement or takes a disappointing initial form, causing a retrace to $70,000 in 2026-2027. The reserve finally takes off in 2028-2029, perhaps due to pressure from other countries starting to implement their own reserves. This allows Bitcoin to near the $400,000 target. This prediction of more volatility but eventually higher prices is based on a few considerations: Crypto isn't one of the Trump administration's main policy positions and is generally a controversial political topic, which will slow down legislation. Even if the reserve is implemented quickly, the buying pressure will be spread out over many years. Bitcoin has followed a remarkably predictable 4-year chart pattern. As the famous saying goes, this will continue to happen until it doesn't. However, if you believe in Bitcoin, I wouldn't try to time the market based on this prediction. Rather, I would hold long term with the expectation that prices will eventually be higher than they are today. The Long-Term Target Short-term price predictions are difficult, and even 5 years is relatively short term when it comes to a volatile asset like Bitcoin. In the long term (10+ years), I believe that even my bull case is too conservative. We can apply the following multipliers to the $400,000 target to get a longer-term target: x2 because we've ignored the ~50% of demand for gold that comes from jewelry, which can also be considered an investment. x2 every 10 years based on gold's historical returns, due in part to inflation. A small additional multiplier from the fact that Bitcoin's supply inflation rate will soon be lower than gold's, and that demand for Bitcoin has historically grown faster than demand for gold. After applying these multipliers, I model a price of 1.5-2 million per coin in 10-15 years. Despite being near all-time highs, Bitcoin still has the potential to 10x in 10 years. That said, Bitcoin is a volatile and risky asset that also has the potential to lose investors' money, especially in the short term. Conclusion Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are complex topics, and their prices are influenced by many factors besides just the Bitcoin reserve. I've written extensively about these topics more generally in past articles and my recently published book Decoding Cryptocurrency . The price formulas I shared above may be over-simplified to focus on the reserve, but I believe that Bitcoin's price will continue to appreciate in the long term. As such, Bitcoin is an important part of a diversified investment portfolio.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4741488-how-much-will-trumps-proposed-bitcoin-strategic-reserve-increase-bitcoins-price-target?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37136248.jpeg

Ripple ( XRP ) surged to a high of $2.50, climbing over 400% from its monthly low. This rally pushed its market cap beyond $130 billion, allowing it to overtake popular coins like Solana ( SOL ), BNB, and Dogecoin ( DOGE ). The primary catalyst for XRP’s surge was Donald Trump’s election victory, which is expected to pave the way for more favorable crypto regulations. This development is significant as Ripple Labs has been embroiled in a legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission since 2020.

Earlier this week, asset manager WisdomTree, overseeing $111 billion in assets, filed for a spot Ripple ETF. Crypto analysts suggest that XRP’s recent rally was largely driven by whale activity, triggering a fear of missing out among retail investors. In an X post, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju highlighted that whale activity on Coinbase played a significant role, as exchange premiums surged to 3%-13%. Conversely, South Korea’s Upbit exchange, which has a substantial XRP trading base, showed no such premium. Coinbase whales are driving this $XRP rally. Over the past 30 days, Coinbase's minute-level price premium has ranged from 3% to 13% during the surge.

First, the coin could experience mean reversion, as it currently trades significantly above its short- and long-term moving averages. Mean reversion suggests that assets often return to their average price over time. Additionally, XRP’s Relative Strength Index and Stochastic Oscillator indicate overbought conditions, signaling potential weakness. Furthermore, XRP may be in the markup phase of the Wyckoff Method, characterized by high demand outpacing supply. This phase is often followed by the distribution phase, which typically leads to a sell-off. Ripple’s price could retreat to retest support at $1.9697, a key level last seen in April 2021.

At present, traders are eagerly waiting for leading digital asset Bitcoin ( BTC ) to cross the $100,000 threshold, although many are suggesting that it could first experience a flash crash . In the meantime, altcoin season seems to have kicked off — driven by the allure of outsized returns, investors are flocking to cryptocurrencies with smaller market caps or even meme coins. One of the most impressive rallies since the uptrend kicked off can be seen with Hedera ( HBAR ), the 19th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization , which has made significant headway in the preceding period. At press time, HBAR was trading at $0.23953 — after an 18.91% gain on the daily chart supplemented by weekly returns up to 65.76%.

For additional clarity, Finbold has consulted one of the most advanced publicly available large language models (LLMs) to shed light on where HBAR could be trading at by the end of 2024. ChatGPT-4o outlines bullish and bearish factors affecting HBAR Several key factors were identified by OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o as being relevant to HBAR’s performance in the closing month of the year. On the bullish side of the aisle, the model noted Hedera’s unique consensus mechanism and scalability, which is driving enterprise adoption, as well as Hedera’s numerous partnerships and collaborations. Additionally, it highlighted the prospect of an HBAR exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) as a potential bullish catalyst — Canary Capital intends to open one such fund, per a November 12 SEC filing . Lastly, increased grants for developers and consistent transaction volume growth, indicative of a robust ecosystem, were mentioned. Bullish factors that could affect HBAR prices. Source: OpenAI As for bearish factors, GPT-4o reflected on the usual regulatory uncertainty that surrounds cryptocurrencies, while also emphasizing worries surrounding the increase in circulating supply and decline in new account creation that could exert downward pressure on HBAR. To cap it off, the AI model mentioned that Hedera could potentially lose ground to networks like Solana ( SOL ) or Polygon (POL) Bearish factors that could affect HBAR prices. Source: OpenAI ChatGPT-4o sets Hedera (HBAR) price targets for the end of 2024 It’s impossible to state which of the many factors that were discussed will end up prevailing in the wider scheme of things — but the AI model did set two price targets, based on a broadly bullish and broadly bearish scenario. In the first case, GPT-4o predicted that HBAR prices could reach as high as $0.35, if strong enterprise adoption is sustained and the asset experiences significant capital inflows from the aforementioned Canary Capital ETF. Should Hedera reach that mark, prices will have surged by 46.1% from current levels. HBAR price targets for the end of 2024.

In a press release on Monday, the largest US crypto miner announced it will raise $700 million to increase its Bitcoin stash. The firm intends to raise the funds by offering convertible senior notes to entities “believed to be qualified institutional buyers” under the law.Notably, Marathon announced the convertible notes are unsecured, with investors obligated to reclaim them in 2031. Per the announcement, MARA reserves the right to offer investors an additional $105 million worth of convertible senior notes, totaling $850 million.Proceeds for Bitcoin PurchaseThe crypto miner noted it would use the realized funds to increase its Bitcoin stash and fulfill other general purposes. For context, MARA will employ a part of the fund, specifically $50 million, to repay holders of its convertible notes due in 2026.As usual, Marathon indicated that investors could redeem the debt vehicle in cash on the due date.

It reached as high as $2.42 before stabilizing around $2.35. This huge hit came after many positive developments brewing around Ripple and XRP with talks of XRP ETFs, stablecoin launch , and IPOs, XRP future indeed looks bright. Recent data from Santiment shows that in just three weeks, wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP coins bought over 679 million tokens. Also, the number of wallets holding XRP has hit a new record of over 5.5 million. These signs show that many big investors are confident in XRP’s long-term potential and that it’s a good time to buy. What Experts Are Saying Dan Tapiero, a well-known investor, has praised XRP’s recent surge, pointing out that the market didn’t fully understand its potential before. He believes this 400% jump isn’t luck but a sign of XRP’s strong fundamentals. He believes that XRP’s price is overlooked by many and since it’s opening wings now it will be the best buy in the coming months. Raoul Pal, the CEO of Real Vision, admitted he was wrong about XRP earlier this year and now sees its growth as significant. Earlier in 2024, Pal had dismissed XRP and Cardano (ADA) as “old cult coins” and urged investors to steer clear of them. However, with XRP’s remarkable rally and growing market influence, Pal admitted he was wrong in his earlier assessment. In a series of X posts, Pal noted that the market conditions and developments surrounding XRP are changing and so is his stance. He referred to XRP’s recent rise as the “Banana Zone,” a playful term he used to describe a phase of explosive growth. Pal’s comments suggest that XRP’s recent performance has forced him to reconsider his XRP take, seeing it as a major player in the crypto space rather than a forgotten token. Ripple’s Legal Wins Are Key Tapiero further noted that XRP is rising because the biggest regulatory hurdle is at ease. Ripple recent legal victory is the root where the judge ruled that XRP is not a security (like stocks), and the SEC reduced its fine from $2 billion to just $125 million. These victories helped clear up legal doubts surrounding XRP and boosted investor confidence. Adding to the good news, the head of the SEC, Gary Gensler, announced that he will step d own in January 2025, which some believe could lead to more favorable regulations for cryptocurrencies. Another factor that’s driving the bulls are anticipated approval of Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD on Dec 4, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple News : WisdomTree Submits XRP ETF S-1 Application With the US SEC , What lies ahead for XRP?

37137109,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51171,1733148039,"Bullish Price Pattern That Sent Cardano (ADA) Soaring 200% in November is Back, but Not for ADA","Driven by a strong bullish price pattern called the “triple bottom” around $0.31, Cardano created waves in November with an amazing 200% rally. Investors have become interested in this trend since it has been shown to be a strong sign of future expansion. Cardano’s market capital value is around $39 billion, its live price today is $1.10, and its trading volume has exceeded $2.7 billion in the past 24 hours. At least for Cardano, ADA’s comfortable rating of #9 on CoinMarketCap shows how this optimistic trend has changed the scene for cryptocurrencies. But suppose I told you that the same trend would spark another surge for another exciting cryptocurrency project instead of for ADA? This new cryptocurrency, Rexas Finance (RXS), poised as the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform, is ready to emulate Cardano’s rapid price action. With forecasts pointing to a $14.1 price target in the next four months, RXS, priced at just $0.10 in its presale as of writing, is positioned to perhaps increase by an amazing 14,200%. Indeed, what Cardano accomplished in 2023 might only be the start for Rexas Finance. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Rising Crypto Space Star The community-driven project, Rexas Finance, has shunned venture money to create a robust and committed investor base. Rexas Finance is generating waves in the crypto space with nearly $19.4 million raised from its $20.75 million presale target. Presale stage 8 is now underway; 276,676,502 RXS tokens have been sold. And with its presale pricing at $0.10, this is the ideal moment to lock your investment before Rexas Finance launches at $0.20 in early 2025 on 2 out of the top 10 tier-1 exchanges, a 110% rise before the actual debut. Enabling people to tokenize actual assets is what distinguishes Rexas Finance. Rexas Finance is transforming crypto and creating opportunities in prominent industries, including real estate, gold, and art. While gold is worth $121.2 trillion and art brings a yearly volume of $65 billion, the real estate sector alone is estimated at a staggering $379.7 trillion. Rexas Finance brings these enormous markets onto the blockchain so that anyone, wherever in the globe, may purchase, sell, or invest in these assets—in whole ownership or fractional shares. Rexas Finance is now Certik audited, guaranteeing that the platform satisfies industry-leading security criteria and provides investors with peace of mind. To encourage further involvement in its presale, Rexas Finance is sponsoring a $1 million giveaway. As of writing, 20 lucky winners will get $50,000 worth of RXS each from the 349,742 total entries. By finishing tasks on the Rexas website and collecting additional entries as they interact with and share the platform, investors can raise their odds. Why Now Is the Right Time to Invest in Rexas Finance Though it won’t be at this price for long, the Rexas Finance coin is now valued at $0.10 in presale. The project is making significant strides, bolstered by its listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, rapidly enhancing its visibility and reach. With RXS expected to hit $14.1, Rexas is headed for a public release at $0.20 and shows a possible 14,200% increase on the horizon. This climb reflects the optimistic price trends that drove Cardano (ADA) to unprecedented heights. Rexas Finance now takes the front stage. The presale is approaching its conclusion, and the opportunity to secure RXS tokens at $0.10 is quickly fading. With Rexas Finance gathering pace, the early backers will have negligible chances to benefit from the provided compelling future of the platform. Seize this unique chance to be part of a tremendous crypto adventure. Conclusion: Seize the Opportunity If you are looking for a startup with real-world use cases and great growth possibilities, Rexas Finance (RXS) is the one to watch. The time to act is now, as a price rise expected to reach $14.1 from $0.10 calls for action. Invest in Rexas Finance right now to participate in the next major crypto success narrative!

Similarly, the DEXX trading terminal suffered a $30 million breach. DEXX is working on recovering the stolen funds alongside law enforcement. Thanks to these crimes, regulatory scrutiny also intensified. The SEC filed a lawsuit against Touzi Capital for misleading investors about its crypto mining fund. On the other hand, some industry leaders expect a potential shift in regulatory enforcement under the new Trump administration. Clipper DEX Denies Private Key Leak Decentralized exchange (DEX) Clipper confirmed that the recent $450,000 hack of its protocol was due to a vulnerability in its withdrawal function. The DEX also dismissed earlier claims that the breach stemmed from a private key leak. The attack took place on Dec. 1, and targeted two liquidity pools. The hack resulted in the loss of about 6% of the protocol’s total value locked. Clipper assured its users that other pools remained unaffected and that the exploit was contained. In a statement on X, Clipper clarified that the ability to withdraw funds in a single token, a feature involving a bundled swap and deposit/withdrawal transaction, appeared to be the source of the exploit. This feature has since been disabled. Security firm Fuzzland’s co-founder, Chaofan Shou , previously speculated on X that the hack could be linked to an API vulnerability that allows unauthorized signing of deposit and withdrawal requests. Clipper, however, held firm that its design and security architecture ruled out a private key leak. The protocol paused swaps and deposits while keeping withdrawals open, albeit requiring a mix of assets from the pool. Clipper is actively tracing the stolen funds and reached out to the attacker to encourage them to contact the team. Crypto losses YTD (Source: Immunefi ) The hack contributes to a year that has already seen more than $1.48 billion worth of crypto stolen by the end of November, according to a report from Immunefi. This figure is still a 15% decline compared to the same period in 2023. $200K Hack Hits Spectral Labs’ Syntax Platform Spectral Labs also recently reported a $200,000 exploit on its Syntax platform, a no-code environment for creating on-chain AI agents. The attack happened due to a vulnerability in its bonding curve. The flaw allowed the attacker to remove tokens at a reduced price. In response, Spectral Labs disabled access to Syntax and paused contracts to prevent any more damage. The company assured users that it is addressing the issue, running extensive tests, and collaborating with industry partners to restore functionality as soon as possible. Crypto hacks and exploits are still a major challenge for the industry. Immunefi’s report shows that November losses from crypto hacks and fraud totaled $71 million. Some of the most serious incidents in November included the $25.5 million exploit of decentralized finance project Thala , which was caused by a vulnerability in its v1 farming contracts. Crypto losses from November of 2024 (Source: Immunefi ) Thala recovered the stolen funds on Nov. 18 with the help of law enforcement but has not revealed the hacker's identity. Another big breach involved the DEXX on-chain trading terminal, where a private key leak resulted in huge losses. Over 8,620 Wallets Linked to DEXX Exploit The recent security exploit on the meme coin trading terminal DEXX drew a lot of attention from the crypto community, with more than 8,620 Solana addresses now suspected of being linked to the hacker behind the attack. On Nov. 16, DEXX fell victim to a breach that resulted in financial losses that affected at least 900 unique users. According to SlowMist’s blockchain intelligence arm, MistTrack , most of the victims lost less than $10,000, but one individual suffered losses of more than $1 million. The total loss from the incident was initially reported to be $21 million, which made it the second-largest hack in November after the $25.5 million Thala attack. Unfortunately, the scale of the DEXX exploit continued to grow, and SlowMist founder Cos revealed that the total losses climbed to an estimated $30 million on Nov. 29. The fluctuating prices of meme tokens impacted the overall financial damage, according to Cos. The hacker has been converting the stolen assets into Solana. SlowMist also committed to publishing any additional wallet addresses that are suspected of being linked to the attack on other blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Base, in the coming week. In response to the attack, DEXX has been actively working on recovery efforts. The platform issued a public statement confirming that it is monitoring the hacker’s wallets and collaborating with blockchain security firm SlowMist and law enforcement agencies. To incentivize the return of stolen assets, DEXX offered a bug bounty and token rewards, but the hacker did not respond to these appeals. Attempts to communicate with the attacker through on-chain messages and email have also been unsuccessful. Bruce, the operations director at DEXX, stated that the platform is actively negotiating with stakeholders, counting the losses, and addressing security vulnerabilities to relaunch the service. The company pledged to compensate the affected users, but the specifics of the compensation plan will depend on the amount of recovered funds. SEC Sues Touzi Capital Recent crypto crimes were not only limited to hacks. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Touzi Capital, accusing the investment firm of misleading investors about the liquidity and profitability of its crypto asset mining fund. According to the SEC, Touzi Capital raised almost $95 million from over 1,200 U.S. investors by promoting the fund as a stable and high-yield investment tied to cryptocurrency mining operations. However, the regulator alleges that the firm misrepresented the risks and diverted investor funds into unrelated ventures. The SEC claims Touzi Capital made false assurances to investors, and compared the fund to high-yield money market accounts while hiding its risky and illiquid nature. Despite the alleged failures of its investments, the firm reportedly continued accepting funds from new investors. The regulator’s complaint also alleges that the promised crypto mining operations were not the primary focus of the raised capital as funds were being commingled across Touzi Capital’s subsidiaries for purposes unrelated to mining. This case is part of a broader crackdown by the SEC on alleged crypto-related frauds, including a recent unsuccessful appeal by Kristoffer Krohn, who argued that his involvement in an $18 million crypto mining scheme did not constitute a securities offering. The federal judge decided to deny Krohn’s appeal. Despite these legal actions, industry leaders like Consensys CEO Joe Lubin suggest that the regulatory landscape for crypto firms could change dramatically very soon. At DevCon 2024 in Thailand, Lubin speculated that the reelection of Donald Trump as U.S. president might lead to the dismissal of many SEC cases, and could potentially save the industry huge amounts of legal costs. However, he pointed out that while not all cases may be dropped, the crypto sector will certainly benefit from a more favorable regulatory environment in the future.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6334/clipper-dex-investigates-hack-that-drained-6-of-its-tvl,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

After reaching a local high of $1.15 on November 23, the price retraced significantly and recently failed to reclaim this key level. The inability to break above $1.15 has raised questions about whether ADA’s bullish momentum can sustain its recent uptrend. Top analyst and investor Ali Martinez has weighed in, highlighting the potential for a 20% correction if Cardano loses critical demand zones. His analysis suggests that ADA’s current consolidation phase could either serve as a foundation for another rally or lead to further downside if key support levels fail to hold. The coming days will be pivotal for Cardano, as its price action will determine whether it can break above yearly highs or retreat to lower levels for consolidation. Investors closely monitor ADA’s ability to hold crucial support zones , as losing them could signal a deeper retracement. Conversely, a decisive move above $1.15 could renew bullish optimism, setting the stage for further gains. Cardano remains at a critical juncture, with both risk and opportunity shaping the market outlook. Cardano Losing Strength Cardano’s (ADA) price action has displayed weakening momentum as it struggles to maintain its upward trajectory. After failing to break above the key $1.15 resistance level decisively, ADA’s bullish momentum appears to be fading. Analysts are now questioning whether Cardano can sustain its recent rally or is poised for a deeper correction. Analyst Ali Martinez shared a detailed technical analysis on X , highlighting key levels that could dictate ADA’s next move. According to Martinez, a close below $1.10 would signal a potential trend shift, raising investor concerns. Furthermore, he notes that a drop below $1.03 would confirm a bearish breakout, potentially driving the price down to $0.88. Martinez’s analysis emphasizes the significance of supply and demand zones, suggesting that these levels could trigger sharp price reactions in either direction. Despite the bearish outlook, there is still room for optimism. Cardano could recover and potentially push toward new highs if the broader cryptocurrency market resumes its bullish trend. However, any upside may lack the strong momentum seen earlier in the rally. Cardano remains at a critical juncture, with its price hovering near key support levels. The next few days will determine whether ADA can reclaim its bullish footing or succumb to increased selling pressure. ADA Testing Support At Crucial Demand Level Cardano is currently trading at $1.08 after failing to sustain its recent bullish momentum above the previous high of $1.15. Despite briefly reaching a new local high of $1.19, the price could not maintain this level, slipping below the $1.15 threshold—a key demand zone that now acts as resistance. This inability to hold above previous highs raises concerns about the strength of ADA’s upward trend. The $1.15 level is pivotal for Cardano’s near-term price action. If ADA manages to reclaim this level and establish it as a solid support, it could reinvigorate bullish sentiment and potentially pave the way for further gains. However, failure to do so increases the risk of a deeper correction, as the current price suggests a lack of sustained buying pressure. Market participants are closely monitoring ADA’s price behavior around this critical zone. A sustained move above $1.15 could signal renewed demand and spark another attempt to push toward $1.20 and beyond. Conversely, continued weakness at current levels might lead to further downside, with ADA testing lower supports.

Ohio data centers acquired at $500/operating KW, significantly below peers’ $900-$1500 range, boosting ROI. 102% annual increase expected by 2024, reaching 50 EH/s, solidifying MARA’s digital asset dominance. Secures electricity at $0.01/kWh, reducing costs and supporting a 34% return on capital employed (ROCE). $2.5B Bitcoin holding (~28% of market cap) positions MARA for gains but exposes it to volatility. Investment Thesis MARA Holdings, Inc. ( MARA ) is poised for exponential growth, underpinned by its aggressive expansion of compute capacity and strategic acquisitions at industry-leading low multiples. With 1.5 GW of nameplate capacity, 65% of which is owned and operated, MARA achieves unmatched cost control and operational efficiency. The company's acquisition of Ohio data centers at ~$500/Operating KW, far below peers' ~$900-$1500, positions it for superior ROI. A 102% annual increase in compute power by 2024 fortifies its digital asset dominance. Coupled with energy partnerships yielding $0.01/kWh electricity and a 34% ROCE, MARA exemplifies scalability, cost leadership, and capital efficiency in a surging compute market. Expansion of Compute Capacity and Low Acquisition Multiples MARA stock holds valuation support from the company's expansion of compute capacity. Here, the company added 372 megawatts ((MW)) of interconnect-approved capacity across three sites in Ohio in Q3 2024. Additionally, acquiring two operational data centers in Hannibal and Hopedale brings in 222 MW, whereas 122 MW is already operational. These centers will generate 100 MW of remaining approved capacity in 2025. Further, MARA is assembling a new 150 MW facility in Findlay, Ohio (30 MW already operational). These ongoing developments may be online by 2025 and may increase the company's compute capacity and get optimized over time. For 2024, there will be a 102% annual increase in compute capacity to 50 EH per second. MARA Investor Presentation Moreover, MARA's strategy is moving beyond expanding capacity with geographic and operational diversification. The data centers are now across multiple jurisdictions so no single independent system operator ((ISO)) has control >50% of MARA's owned and operated capacity . This strategy minimizes risks from regulatory shifts, system failures, and operational issues within a single ISO. It pushes MARA to leverage multiple energy markets and maximize the potential for business returns. MARA's return on capital employed (ROCE) is now at 34% just behind the tech sector's 43%. Meanwhile, the closest peer yielded 23%. Further, MARA acquired the two data centers in Ohio at a cost of ~$270K per MW of interconnect-approved capacity. This acquisition cost is lower than its publicly traded peers. MARA's turnkey purchase multiple is at ~$500/Operating KW whereas the closest peers are in ~$900-$1500/Operating KW range. The relatively low cost of acquisition indicates MARA is securing valuable assets at attractive prices. With that, MARA may continue to yield high investment once the compute data centers become online and fully operational. By acquiring assets at a low multiple , MARA can have massive operational savings. At the Hopedale data center, MARA projects that ownership may reduce operating costs by up to ~50%. This heavy cut in OpEx will boost the company's bottom line and operational edge obviously. In a capital-intensive industry like data centers, OpEx can burn a major portion of revenue. By reducing its operational footprint and boosting control over its assets, MARA may derive economies of scale to optimize its bottom line. MARA Investor Presentation Additionally, MARA persists in its digital asset compute market lead due to its high scale. In 2024, the company secured ~1 gigawatt (GW) of nameplate capacity through acquisitions and greenfield developments, bringing its consolidated nameplate capacity to ~1.5 GW. 65% of this capacity may be owned and operated by MARA. As a result, this direct control scales up MARA's lead in the digital asset compute and data center sector. How? By owning and operating a majority of its assets, MARA gains a cost edge against the market. Relying on leasing and third-party arrangements brings in additional costs and less operational control. The ownership of such a large portion of its capacity provides MARA with a higher potency of long-term improvement in its cost structure. Market-wise, the demand for data storage and compute capacity continues to grow, now owning and operating data centers may allow MARA to have a larger market opportunity. Overall, the company is now best-capitalized and can edge by pursuing M&A opportunities to accelerate its operational growth and compute expansion. MARA Investor Presentation Energy Dependency, Bitcoin Price Volatility, and HODL Strategy As observed, MARA Holdings targets to reduce OpEx (mostly energy costs), but it requires sharp scaling of energy generation and managing power prices against the macro challenges. While MARA hit a high reduction in energy costs (through its partnership with NGON ) the ability to continue to derive electricity at ~$0.01 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) against the market price of $0.04 per kWh makes the long-term scalability of this cost-saving strategy uncertain. Although this reduction can be sustained with the use of stranded gas, the availability of this energy resource on a large scale (for MARA's needs) may be limited based on the outlook for demand from Asia giants. On the earnings call, MARA mentioned over 1 million gigawatt-hours of available stranded gas. However, this is an estimate based on the entire market availability, not what can be reliably captured and utilized by MARA alone. Although MARA is focusing on securing more control over its energy generation by investing in its own sites, its energy strategy is still subject to partnerships and the state of the market. MARA is currently operating in competitive energy regions like PJM that do not offer exclusive control over pricing and supply. If the cost of energy and access to cheap stranded gas increases or at least becomes more volatile, MARA can be hit by high operational/bottom-line issues and related drops in valuations. iea.org Moreover, MARA's move to expand its energy generation and cut costs by increasingly relying on its owned and operated data centers (scaling energy infrastructure with new technologies like micro data centers) is capital intensive. MARA's expansion efforts may continue to require massive financial outlay to build/acquire assets. Now, given the size of MARA's operations and its target to scale up capacity with large sites (100-megawatt and larger), any delays or failures in scaling energy resources could hurt its growth potential and street confidence (analysts' estimates). Further, MARA's balance sheet holds ~$2.5 billion worth of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) with an average purchase cost of under $50K per Bitcoin. This holding is a major fraction of its market value (28% at the time of writing), and the price fluctuations of Bitcoin directly hit MARA's stock price. MARA has a solid return on its Bitcoin investments due to the recent surge in Bitcoin prices, but the same volatility could also lead to massive losses if prices drop sharply below $50K (under Bitcoin Market Cycle). MARA's strategy on Bitcoin (Full ""HODLˮ approach) introduces huge risk by getting highly exposed to fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices. While the company preferred the flexibility in managing its Bitcoin through yield generation, collateralized loans, or asset purchases, all-in-all these solutions still carry risk. Lastly, the value of collateralized Bitcoin may diminish with a drop in Bitcoin prices reducing MARA's capability to derive cash from this source. calebandbrown.com Takeaway MARA's aggressive expansion of compute capacity, driven by industry-leading low acquisition multiples and cost-efficient operations, positions it as a dominant player in the digital asset and data center space. With 1.5 GW of capacity and unparalleled cost control, MARA is set for robust growth, offering superior ROI and scalability in a rapidly expanding market.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4741460-why-mara-holdings-could-be-bitcoins-biggest-beneficiary?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37135739.jpeg

The wallet will allow users to safeguard and manage their crypto on over 2,300+ blockchains. Users can now pay for gas fees using $USDT or $CTRL for all transactions. Ctrl , the one-for-all wallet solution, announced the launch of its browser extension wallet, in a move set to simplify self-custody for users across 2,300+ blockchains. The platform is built to work with all major blockchains including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cosmos, Solana, THORchain etc., breathing fresh air to managing and securing digital assets. The Ctrl browser extension wallet simplifies self-custody by consolidating all assets within a single, intuitive platform. It makes it easy to connect to DApps, swap tokens cross-chain, aggregate one's portfolio, and even uncover forgotten funds. The wallet has an easy setup routine that allows users to sign up using their email or social accounts or a passphrase for more advanced crypto users without sacrificing the security of users’ funds. Speaking on the latest innovation, Emile Dubié, Co-Founder and CEO of Ctrl stated the goal for his company is to “make self-custody accessible to everyone” and promote mass adoption of crypto globally. “Our extension wallet is making self-custody accessible to everyone around the world,” Dubié stated. “Our team is committed to creating a wallet that empowers users to control their assets and take advantage of all the opportunities in crypto.” Founded in 2020 and previously named XDEFI, Ctrl has grown into one of the most reliable self-custody wallet solutions, rivalling Brave, Metamask and other top wallets.

By eliminating the need to hold multiple tokens for gas fees, Ctrl Wallet provides a smoother, more efficient experience across networks. On the launch of the Gas Tank, Emile Dubié stated: “The Gas Tank is a game-changer for self-custody. Our users can now interact cross-chain without the hassle of managing different gas tokens. This launch represents a significant step forward in making self-custody as user-friendly as possible.” Notwithstanding the new wallet will also include several features that ease the usability and management of funds on the wallet. First, users will have a unified portfolio view to enhance ease of use, giving users a single, aggregated dashboard to manage holdings across multiple accounts and blockchains. This view not only allows users to keep track of their assets effortlessly but also makes it possible to rediscover funds they may have forgotten. Additionally, the dashboard will also allow users to easily locate assets spread across different blockchains, platforms, or DApp accounts. Every account and platform linked to the wallet’s seed phrase and hidden tokens on custom networks will be shown on the dashboard. Finally, the browser extension wallet will also introduce cross-chain swaps, removing the need for bridges or third-party applications. Ctrl Wallet provides a solution for this by enabling cross-chain swaps directly within the wallet. With support for major blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche, Ctrl Wallet allows users to swap tokens across ecosystems seamlessly. Integrated routing providers ensure they get competitive rates without the need for external tools. The recent developments on Ctrl Wallet have seen rapid adoption rates for the self-custody solution, reaching a milestone of over half a million users and becoming a top five multi-ecosystem wallet with the highest ratings on the Google Chrome Store.

37135792,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98226,1733147929,MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Tells Microsoft Adopting A Bitcoin Strategy Could Boost Its Valuation By $5 Trillion,"MicroStrategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor shared a detailed Bitcoin adoption strategy with Microsoft’s board of directors, demonstrating during the three-minute, 44-slide pitch how the tech giant could create about $5 trillion in shareholder value by going all-in on the world’s largest and oldest cryptocurrency. “Bitcoin’s The Best Asset You Can Own”: Saylor MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor told Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and the board of directors that Bitcoin remains the best asset the firm can own. “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next technology wave, and Bitcoin is that wave,” Saylor posited during a recent presentation to Microsoft. “Bitcoin represents the greatest digital transformation of the 21st century that represents digital capital.” The outspoken Bitcoin bull outlined how Microsoft could convert its current $200 billion in capital distributions into Bitcoin, stressing the potential for slashing enterprise value at risk from 95% to 59% while improving annual returns from 10.4% to 15.8%. “Bitcoin is the universal, perpetual, profitable merger partner,” Saylor told the board, comparing the strategy to acquiring “a $100 billion company growing at 60% per year at 1x revenue.” Saylor continued to tell the board that it “makes sense” for Microsoft to buy $100 billion worth of Bitcoin every year instead of purchasing its own stock or holding bonds. “You’ve surrendered hundreds of billions of dollars of capital over the past five years, and you’ve just amplified the risks that your own shareholders face,” Saylor opined. “If you want to escape that vicious cycle, you’re going to need an asset without counterparty risk.” In his pitch, Saylor claimed that Microsoft could boost its share price by $584 per share and add up to $4.9 trillion to its enterprise value by 2034, assuming that the Wall Street behemoth converts its cash flows, dividends, buybacks, and debt into BTC — in what would represent one of the most significant corporate adoptions of the apex crypto to date. With its $3.148 trillion market cap, Microsoft is currently the third most valuable globally, trailing behind only Apple and Nvidia Corp. The “Crypto Renaissance” Saylor further told the Microsoft board that public and political support for Bitcoin is skyrocketing and that there is a “crypto renaissance”, citing pro-crypto commitments made by President-elect Donald Trump and novel Bitcoin investment vehicles introduced on Wall Street by prominent companies. “Do the right thing for your customers, employees, shareholders, the country, the world, and your legacy,” Saylor concluded, “adopt Bitcoin”. Notably, the price of Bitcoin has spiked 130% so far this year — roughly 37% over the last month alone — to touch the underbelly of the highly-coveted $100,000 mark. Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy has acquired roughly 386,700 BTC for a total of $22 billion since late 2020. Its BTC stash is now valued at $36.8 billion, with Bitcoin priced at $95,400. MicroStrategy’s shares are up 465% year-to-date alongside the value of its Bitcoin stockpile as it continues to leverage its position and buy up more BTC. This is part of MicroStrategy’s bold “21/21” strategy announced in October, which seeks to raise $42 billion through equal amounts of stock and bond sales through 2027 to boost its Bitcoin holdings.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/microstrategys-michael-saylor-tells-microsoft-adopting-a-bitcoin-strategy-could-boost-its-valuation-by-5-trillion/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

37135371,https://coinpedia.org/?p=388088,1733147352,Can Avalanche (AVAX) Break $50 and Rally to $169?,"The post Can Avalanche (AVAX) Break $50 and Rally to $169? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Avalanche (AVAX) is turning heads again. Its price has jumped an impressive 9.45% in the past 24 hours, but the buzz isn’t just about numbers. Behind the scenes, rumors of political connections and comparisons to Ripple (XRP) are fueling big hopes. Could this be the moment AVAX finally breaks through its limits and sets a new all-time high? Let’s break it all down. Trading Momentum Has Traders Watching Closely AVAX is now priced at $48.09, and it’s not just the 9.45% spike that has people talking. Its trading volume has exploded by a jaw-dropping 233.35%, climbing to $2.22 billion in just a day. That’s pretty wild and cements AVAX as the 10th-largest cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap. But it’s not all smooth sailing. The $50 mark is proving to be a tough barrier. Technical indicators are sending mixed signals—moving averages are looking bullish, with the 20, 50, and 100-day lines crossing above the 200-day average. But here’s the catch: the RSI is sitting at 75.87, putting AVAX in the overbought zone. That could mean a short-term pause before the next leg up. Profitability Stats According to the data by IntoTheBlock, 81% of the AVAX investors are in profit at the current price. That’s a pretty solid indication of positive investor sentiment. However, 16% investors are still waiting to enter the profit zone while 2% are at break even level. This clearly suggests how confident investors are in regards to Avalanche and they are holding strong especially looking at the recent surge. But some may still be waiting for a breakout past $50 to book profits or buy more. Is Ripple Leading the Way for Avalanche? What’s adding to the hype is how Avalanche’s rise seems to mirror Ripple’s recent success. Ripple (XRP) gained major traction after legal wins and hints of deeper collaboration with U.S. regulators. Now, Avalanche might be charting a similar path. Emin Gün Sirer, the CEO of Ava Labs, recently hinted at quiet discussions with the incoming Trump administration, which is being seen as crypto-friendly. In his words, Avalanche tends to deliver “results, in total Avalanche fashion.” This kind of political backing could boost AVAX’s chances of thriving in the U.S., much like Ripple has benefited from its own regulatory clarity. Yes, of course we are. You will not see us parade our political connections in social media. You'll just suddenly see results, in total Avalanche fashion. Plan accordingly. https://t.co/98tp1SR2QY — egs9000 (@el33th4xor) December 2, 2024 The comparison has traders excited. If AVAX can ride this wave of optimism and secure its own breakthroughs, the potential upside is huge. What’s Next for Avalanche? Here’s what everyone’s asking: can AVAX finally smash past $50 and aim for $169, as Fibonacci projections suggest? The answer might depend on whether it sustains its current momentum and how these political developments unfold. If Avalanche’s talks with U.S. regulators deliver meaningful results, it could cement its position as a blockchain leader. While short-term pullbacks are possible, the long-term picture looks promising. The big question is, how high can Avalanche climb—and how soon?",POSITIVE,AVAX | XRP,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/can-avalanche-avax-break-50-and-rally-to-169/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37138260,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315148,1733147069,MARA Holdings to Raise An Additional $805M for Bitcoin Purchases and Debt Repayment,"MARA Holdings , Inc., a prominent player in the digital asset and blockchain computing sector, has announced its intention to raise $805 million by issuing convertible senior notes due in 2031. The move is part of the company’s strategy to expand its Bitcoin holdings and manage its existing debt obligations. The company targets qualified institutional buyers with an offering that includes $700 million in convertible senior notes and an additional $105 million available at the discretion of initial purchasers. Today, we announced a proposed private offering of 0% convertible notes of $700 million + $105 million option. Proceeds to be used primarily to acquire bitcoin and repurchase existing 2026 convertible notes up to $50 million. https://t.co/S9kgfId4rp — MARA (@MARAHoldings) December 2, 2024 Another $805 Bitcoin Purchases: Is MARA Holdings The New MicroStrategy? MARA plans to direct the proceeds from its recent offering toward several key areas. The company will allocate up to $199 million to repurchase a portion of its existing convertible notes due in 2026, while it will use the remaining funds to enhance its Bitcoin reserves and support general corporate purposes. This may include working capital, strategic acquisitions, expanding operational assets, and repaying additional debt. The company emphasized that the notes will be unsecured and will not bear interest under normal circumstances. They will mature in June 2031, and depending on MARA’s election, they will offer conversion options into cash, shares of MARA’s common stock, or a combination of both. This funding initiative comes at a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency market, coinciding with a favorable shift in the U.S. regulatory and political landscape. The election of Donald Trump , a pro-crypto president, and a Republican-controlled Congress have significantly boosted optimism within the digital asset sector. Industry observers, including Coinbase’s Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad, have recently noted that the new administration could expedite cryptocurrency regulation, particularly around market structure and stablecoin frameworks. The Trump administration’s supportive stance has also reinvigorated confidence in companies like MARA, which are deeply entrenched in Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Jim Cramer , host of Mad Money, has also highlighted Bitcoin’s potential to thrive under the new administration and in oil services. He has pointed out that Trump’s policies could lead to strategic Bitcoin hoarding, effectively cementing the cryptocurrency as a core asset class. Cramer noted that smaller oil service stocks have surged, driven by Trump’s agenda to boost U.S. oil production by an additional 3 million barrels daily. Cramer also linked Bitcoin’s recent rally to optimism about a Trump administration that is expected to be far more supportive of crypto than the Biden administration’s regulatory approach. He suggested that a pro-crypto Trump administration could spur strategic Bitcoin reserves and increase asset hoarding, benefiting Bitcoin holders and ETFs tracking its performance. Institutional Appetite Amid Upcoming Rally MARA’s decision to issue convertible notes indicates the growing institutional appetite for cryptocurrency exposure. The company is aligning itself with market trends where institutional investors increasingly seek safer entry points into the crypto market. With companies like MARA continually increasing their Bitcoin holdings and institutional investors pouring capital into digital assets, the lines between traditional finance and the crypto ecosystem are becoming increasingly blurred. This latest MARA strategy could have ripple effects, especially now that the crypto market is performing some corrections. Recently, MARA has cemented its position as one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders , adding 703 BTC on November 28 to amass a total of 34,794 BTC, valued at $3.3 billion.

While the trader’s sentiments for some of the tokens remain uncertain, for other’s it’s just bullish. In the meantime, some of the primitive tokens, like Cardano & Solana, are facing tough times and are expected to lose more gains in the coming days. With this, the bulls may get a good entry as the prices of ADA & SOL continue to remain under bullish influence in the long term. Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis Cardano is testing some crucial support levels, losing which the token is believed to undergo a hefty 15% pullback. The ADA price has begun to swell after prolonged consolidation, and hence it can be assumed that the market participants may have extracted profits after a pretty long wait. However, the price is expected to trigger a strong rebound after the selling pressure fades off with lower selling volume. As seen in the above chart, the ADA price is trading within an ascending triangle in the short term and is trying hard to defend the ascending support. With this, the token has entered a decisive phase and a close below $1.10 signals a trend shift, while a drop under $1.03 could confirm a bearish breakdown to $0.88. However, the technicals remain in bullish favor, which suggests the bulls to enter the ring anytime from now and revamp a strong ascending trend towards a new ATH. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis The Solana price was expected to be one of the most dominant altcoins during the ongoing bullish action, with the price targets above $300 in the short term and above $500 in the long term. However, a major shift in market sentiments appears to have occurred, according to which the price is now feared to plunge back to $200 if bulls fail to defend the support at $220. The SOL price is now testing the neckline of the head and shoulder pattern, which is flashing massive bearish signals. Besides, the price is trading between the base & conversion lines of the Ichimoku cloud, and it appears that the levels are heading towards a bearish crossover, flipping the cloud to bearish and triggering a sell signal. The descending RSI also validates a bearish claim along with a major drop in volume. Therefore, the prices of Cardano & Solana are heading towards the lower support by losing nearly 15% of its value. If the bulls fail to hold the levels, more bearish action may occur.",NEUTRAL,ADA | SOL,ADA | ALTCOIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/cardano-this-popular-altcoin-is-heading-for-20-pullback-can-bulls-prevent-excess-price-drain/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

However, the landscape could soon change, as investors seem primed to start inserting fresh funds into the market. BTC to Head North Soon? CryptoPotato reported BTC’s price drop that drove the asset to a multi-day low of under $95,000 after the relatively quiet weekend. It cost over-leveraged traders dearly as the total liquidations have shot up to almost $550 million on a daily scale, with longs responsible for the lion’s share. However, there are certain indicators that suggest BTC’s impressive rally that started after Trump’s victory is not over. Aside from the relative unrealized profit metric, which still shows that the market has not reached an overheated state yet, a recent CryptoQuant report hints at more buying power prepared to be discharged. The ERC-20 stablecoin reserves on Binance have reached a new all-time high of over $28 billion. This means that the capital sitting on the sidelines waiting for proper opportunities to enter the market on the world’s largest crypto exchange has never been so much. Binance’s role is highly significant due to its dominance over the industry. The report depicts the exchange as a “liquidity hub, attracting traders and institutions for stablecoin transactions, storage, and trading.” As such, the massive amounts of stablecoins sitting there amid a market-wide retracement could be the beginning of yet another rally: “Market Sentiment: Rising reserves indicate renewed confidence, increased trading activity, and staking.” – reads the report.

SOL Price Turns Red with XRP Rally – Can SOL Reach $1,000 in December?","Indeed, the SOL price appears to be the latest victim of post-rally fatigue, affecting other notable altcoins alike . In a rough start to the month, today’s 4.82% decline takes the week’s losses to 11.56%. Amidst post-election hype, many coins have outpaced their fundamentals and most bullish projections , and it seems the 35.55% gain Solana has seen over the past month is now in question. Particularly as this decline comes with a 50% increase in trading volume, nearing $5.5 billion, it seems the downtrend still holds momentum. SOL Price Analysis: Is a $1,000 Solana Still in Play? Technical indicators lay grounds for optimism, as the recent breakout of a cup-and-handle pattern forming since late 2021 favors a bullish continuation of Solana’s long-term price appreciation. SOL / USDT 1D chart, cup-and-handle pattern breakout. Source: Binance. Given that the pattern fully materializes, it sets a price target of $380, a 70% advance on current prices, and a credible target that runs into the final month of the year. While $1,000 is also far within the realms of possibility, it’s more likely such highs will be seen further into next year, especially with anticipated fundamental developments like Solana Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). In the meantime, the SOL price seems to be amidst a natural and healthy correction, finding more stable footing for its next leg up. Particularly following the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stint in overbought territory, surpassing 80, a telling sign that a correction was due. With the RSI reaching the neutral zone at 50, the correction seems to be near its end. The support zone around $205.30 appears to be a possible local bottom, in line with consistent support provided by the 50SMA throughout the rally.

Bitcoin Development Company MicroStrategy (MSTR) is now the owner of nearly 2% of all the bitcoin (BTC) that will ever be created after adding to its holdings of the token.  The firm disclosed the purchase of 15,400 bitcoin over the week ended Dec. 1 for $15.4 billion, or an average price of $95,976 each on Monday. That brings its holdings to 402,100 tokens worth $38.2 billion at the current price of $95,000. The company's overall average purchase price is $58,263.  This most recent buy was funded with share sales under the company's existing at-the-market program, according to the disclosure.  Executive Chairman Michael Saylor once again on Sunday teased the Monday announcement.  MicroStrategy's 402,100 tokens amount to more than 1.9% of the 21 million bitcoin that can ever be created.  Other developments  Underway is the process for rebalancing the Nasdaq 100 and one discussion point is whether MicroStrategy will be included in the refigured index. An announcement on inclusion is due to take place on Dec. 13.    On Sunday Saylor posted that he gave a 3-minute presentation to the Microsoft (MSFT) board regarding bitcoin investment as a diversification strategy.  Saylor told the board that its current treasury strategy is weakening the company while its daily traded volume is being outpaced by MicroStrategy, according to a presentation he posted on X. As of Nov. 27, taking the average of the past five trading days, Microsoft has generated $9.7 billion in average daily trading volume against MicroStrategy's $22 billion. They both have similar options open interest, despite MicroStrategy being just 2.5% the size of Microsoft.  ""If you are going to outperform you are going to need bitcoin, and your bonds are undermining your options market and your equity liquidity,"" Saylor told the Microsoft board.   Saylor said the board had surrendered $200 billion in capital in the past five years through dividends or stock buybacks. These funds would have been better used to buy bitcoin as a treasury asset, he said. Bitcoin is up over 1,200% in the past five years, which shows a massive opportunity missed by Microsoft.       MSTR shares rose 1.23% on Monday and remain higher by 450% year-to-date.  MARA also adds   Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings (MARA) — which has been trying to replicate Saylor's strategy of raising money in capital markets to fund bitcoin purchases — announced Monday the purchase of another 6,484 BTC during the period between Oct. 1 and Nov. 30 for approximately $618.3 million in cash at an average cost of approximately $95,352.   The company additionally launched a proposed private offering of $700 million in zero-coupon convertible senior notes due 2031. The proceeds will primarily be used to acquire further bitcoin and repurchase existing convertible notes due 2026.  MARA as of Nov. 30 holds a total of 34,959 bitcoin worth $3.3 billion at the current price.

Michael Saylor Urges Microsoft to Invest in Bitcoin: “The Best Asset You Can Have” Addressing Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and the company's board of directors, Saylor argued that Bitcoin represents “the greatest digital transformation of the 21st century.” In a three-minute presentation shared online, Saylor highlighted Bitcoin's potential to reshape corporate finance and increase Microsoft's enterprise value. “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next wave of technology, and that wave is Bitcoin,” Saylor said. “It makes sense for Microsoft to buy and hold Bitcoin rather than buy back stocks or hold bonds.” Saylor criticized Microsoft’s financial strategy of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, arguing that such moves increase risks for shareholders. Instead, he recommended Bitcoin as a superior alternative without counterparty risk. Saylor claimed that if Microsoft converted its cash flows, dividends, buybacks, and debt into Bitcoin, the company's stock price could increase by $584 per share, adding $4.9 trillion to its enterprise value by 2034. Microsoft shares closed at $423.46 on Friday, up 0.11% on the day and 3.67% over the past month, according to Google Finance. MicroStrategy's Bitcoin Strategy MicroStrategy, under Saylor’s leadership, has been a pioneer in institutional Bitcoin adoption. Since it began accumulating in 2020, the company has amassed 386,700 BTC, worth over $37.7 billion at current prices. The firm’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy has paid off, with shares up 465% year to date. Saylor's recent presentation to Microsoft underscores his belief that Bitcoin is a transformative asset for large companies. While Microsoft has not publicly commented on Saylor's recommendation, the proposal highlights Bitcoin's growing influence in corporate strategy discussions. *This is not investment advice.

37134955,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=621497,1733146419,Saudi Arabia’s US Treasury holdings hit four-year high,"Saudi Arabia’s investments in US Treasury bonds have soared to their highest point in four years. The Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) now holds $144 billion in US Treasuries, which account for 35% of its total foreign assets as of the latest data in October. This is the largest share since February 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic first rattled global markets. Despite this surge in US bond holdings, Saudi Arabia’s total foreign reserves have plunged to $411 billion, marking their lowest point since February 2020. The drop reflects a mix of economic strategy and fiscal necessity, with massive withdrawals directed toward the country’s sovereign wealth fund and domestic government spending. Shifting reserves: A tactical play In 2020, SAMA’s US Treasury holdings made up over 37% of its foreign reserves before dropping sharply. The decline came after a $40 billion transfer to the Public Investment Fund (PIF) as the government moved to capitalize on global market chaos. It tapped those reserves to buy discounted assets during a period of investor panic. The timing of this shift is impossible to ignore. Donald Trump’s return to the White House could rejuvenate Saudi Arabia’s political and economic alignment with the US. Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who enjoyed a close relationship with Trump during his first term, appears to be positioning Saudi Arabia to strengthen ties with the incoming administration. Earlier this month, Yasir Al Rumayyan, the head of the PIF and a trusted ally of Prince Mohammed, was spotted sitting next to Trump at a UFC event in New York. That was a public display of camaraderie that could mean the kingdom is ready to recalibrate its US relationships under a familiar political ally. Treasury yields surge: Investors await labor data Treasury yields edged higher on Monday as investors braced for key labor and manufacturing data set to drop later this week. The 10-year Treasury yield ticked up by 1 basis point to hit 4.207%, while the 2-year yield climbed 2 basis points, landing at 4.192%. On Friday, the 10-year yield had dipped to its lowest point since late October, catching some attention before this week’s movements. For context, a basis point is 0.01%, and yields move in the opposite direction of bond prices. Right now, investors are laser-focused on upcoming labor data, hoping to gauge the US economy’s pulse. On Wednesday, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for October will drop, giving numbers on job openings, hires, layoffs, and quits. It’s a solid first look at how the labor market is holding up. Then, the big one: Friday’s November jobs report. Analysts are betting on a gain of 177,500 jobs for the month, based on FactSet’s consensus, which would be a big jump from October’s slim 12,000 jobs. Unemployment is also expected to inch up slightly to 4.2% from 4.1%, according to the same estimates.

37134715,https://coinpaper.com/6335/pump-fun-revenue-plummets-after-livestream-shutdown,1733146106,Pump.fun Revenue Plummets After Livestream Shutdown,"In the month of November, the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem experienced significant developments that caught the attention of many enthusiasts and investors alike. Notably, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) demonstrated a remarkable resurgence, boasting an impressive 57.8% increase in monthly sales, signaling renewed interest and activity in this vibrant market. On the other hand, Solana’s meme coin launchpad, Pump.fun, encountered some challenges, particularly after the disabling of its livestream feature, which may have impacted user engagement and overall performance. Pump.fun’s Revenue Plummets Amid Livestream Shutdown Following Violent Content Reports Solana meme coin launchpad Pump.fun has experienced a sharp decline in weekly revenue following the controversial disabling of its livestream feature. The move came in response to reports of harmful and violent content being broadcast on its platform, raising concerns over the company’s moderation policies and long-term viability. Pump.fun started November on a strong note, showing robust revenue growth fueled by the surging popularity of its meme coin launchpad. According to DefiLlama , the platform generated $33.83 million in revenue during the week of Nov. 18–24, marking a staggering 60% increase from the previous week and an almost 400% surge from the beginning of the month. However, the platform’s revenue trajectory took a dramatic turn the following week. Between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1, Pump.fun recorded just $11.31 million in revenue, representing a 66% week-over-week decline. This abrupt reversal coincided with the removal of its livestream feature , a decision that has sparked mixed reactions from the community. Pump.fun’s livestream feature was initially lauded for fostering user engagement and providing a dynamic environment for promoting new tokens. However, it quickly became a flashpoint for controversy. On Nov. 25, troubling incidents were reported by community members and safety professionals, drawing widespread attention to the platform. One particularly alarming incident involved a streamer who threatened to commit suicide if their coin did not achieve a specific market cap. This prompted Beau, a safety project manager for Pudgy Penguins, to tag Pump.fun on X, urging immediate action to disable the stream and provide support to the individual involved. Other users reported equally disturbing content, including threats of violence against animals and schools. These reports prompted swift action from Pump.fun, which announced on Nov. 25 that it had indefinitely paused its livestream feature to address the growing concerns. In a community note, Pump.fun acknowledged the gravity of the situation, stating that the events on its livestreams had “caused concern” and that it was working to implement proper moderation tools before reinstating the feature. Legal and Regulatory Implications The fallout from the livestream controversy has extended beyond the realm of community criticism, drawing attention from legal experts and regulatory bodies. Yuriy Brisov, a partner at Digital and Analogue Partners, described the situation as “a legitimate reason for a criminal investigation and civil lawsuits.” His comments serve as a warning of the potential legal ramifications for Pump.fun, which may face scrutiny for its failure to prevent harmful content from being broadcast. Mikko Ohtamaa, co-founder of Trading Strategy, echoed similar concerns, suggesting that the platform could either face immediate closure by authorities or eventual shutdown once regulators grasp the complexities of the situation. These statements shed some light on the precarious position of Pump.fun as it navigates the aftermath of its livestream debacle. The decision to disable the livestream feature has elicited varied responses from the Pump.fun community and the broader crypto industry. While some have praised the platform for taking swift action to address the issue, others have criticized the move as reactionary and indicative of deeper systemic problems. The incident has also reignited discussions about the ethical responsibilities of platforms in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Critics argue that Pump.fun’s reliance on user-generated content without robust moderation mechanisms reflects a broader challenge for DeFi platforms, which often prioritize innovation over regulatory compliance and safety. Despite its recent setbacks, Pump.fun remains a significant player in the Solana ecosystem, and its ability to recover from this crisis will likely hinge on how effectively it addresses the root causes of the controversy. Implementing comprehensive moderation tools and establishing clear community guidelines will be critical steps in restoring trust and resuming growth. The platform has also hinted at future developments, including the potential launch of its own token and a new trading terminal. These initiatives could help Pump.fun regain momentum, provided it can navigate the regulatory scrutiny and community concerns stemming from the livestream controversy. The Pump.fun saga serves as a cautionary tale for the constantly evolving DeFi space, highlighting the challenges of balancing innovation with ethical responsibility and regulatory compliance. As the platform works to rebuild its reputation and revenue, its actions in the coming months will be closely watched by both its users and industry stakeholders. For now, Pump.fun faces the daunting task of demonstrating that it can grow responsibly while addressing the complex issues that have arisen from its rapid ascent. Whether it can rise to the occasion remains to be seen, but the outcome will undoubtedly have implications for the broader DeFi ecosystem. NFT Market Rebounds: November Sales Volume Surges 57.8% Amid Broader Crypto Recovery While Pump.fun’s revenue took a dive, the non-fungible token ( NFT ) market demonstrated a robust recovery in November, with monthly sales volume climbing by 57.8% to $562 million. This marks the highest sales volume since May 2024, signaling renewed investor interest in digital collectibles after months of declining momentum. Data from CryptoSlam reveals that November’s sales represented a significant rebound from October, positioning NFTs on an upward trajectory for the first time since March 2024. While the $562 million in sales is a positive development, it still pales in comparison to the $1.6 billion recorded during the market's 2024 peak in March. Between March and October, the NFT market faced a prolonged slump, with monthly sales volumes steadily declining to levels not seen since 2021. This resurgence could mark the beginning of a broader market recovery, driven by an increase in blockchain activity and heightened interest in prominent NFT collections. Among the standout performers, CryptoPunks solidified its position as a leading NFT collection, with a remarkable rise in floor price and sales volume. Data from DefiLlama shows that the CryptoPunks floor price jumped from 26.3 Ether (ETH) on Nov. 1 to 39.7 ETH by the end of the month—an increase of 52%. At current market prices, this rise translates to an approximate valuation of $147,000 per CryptoPunk. In terms of sales, CryptoSlam reported over $49 million in 30-day sales volume for the collection, reflecting a staggering 392% month-on-month increase. The number of sales transactions also surged to 388 in November, up 213% from October. Another collection that captured significant attention in November was Pudgy Penguins. The collection’s monthly sales volume reached $16 million, representing a 262% increase compared to October. According to DefiLlama , Pudgy Penguins’ floor price climbed from 8.7 ETH on Nov. 1 to 13 ETH by the end of November, equating to a 49% gain and a current valuation of approximately $48,000 per token. The rise in both floor price and sales volume suggests growing demand for this collection, further emphasizing the resurgence of interest in blue-chip NFTs. The recovery in NFT sales was not limited to individual collections, as top blockchain networks also posted impressive numbers in November. Ethereum maintained its dominance in the NFT ecosystem, accounting for over $216 million in sales volume, a 12% increase from the previous month. Bitcoin emerged as the fastest-growing blockchain for NFTs in November, with sales volume soaring by 99.44% to $186 million. The significant jump suggests the adoption of Ordinals, a technology that facilitates NFTs on the Bitcoin network, is increasing. Other blockchain platforms, including Solana, Mythos Chain, Immutable, Polygon, and BNB Chain, collectively recorded $162.9 million in sales. These networks continue to provide alternative ecosystems for NFT trading, appealing to users seeking diverse options beyond Ethereum and Bitcoin. Renewed Optimism in the NFT Market The NFT market’s resurgence comes amid broader recovery trends in the cryptocurrency sector. Rising digital asset prices and increased blockchain activity have helped boost investor confidence, drawing attention back to NFTs as a speculative and cultural asset class. Market analysts attribute this rebound to several factors, including the improving macroeconomic environment, a surge in new NFT-related projects, and heightened interest in utility-focused NFTs, such as gaming and metaverse assets. The performance of flagship collections like CryptoPunks and Pudgy Penguins has also played a pivotal role in reinforcing market sentiment. While November’s recovery is promising, the NFT market still faces challenges that could dampen its growth. Regulatory uncertainties, market volatility, and the high cost of transactions on certain blockchains remain key concerns for participants. Additionally, with sales volumes still far below their 2024 peak, sustained growth will require innovation and broader adoption of NFTs beyond speculative trading. Market participants are increasingly looking for NFTs that offer tangible utility, such as access to exclusive content, experiences, or digital rights management.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6335/pump-fun-revenue-plummets-after-livestream-shutdown,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Popular Bitcoin bull Adam Back was quick to praise the company’s move, describing the average entry of $95,976 as a ‘good price.’ MicroStrategy has acquired 15,400 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$95,976 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 38.7% QTD and 63.3% YTD.

Although the firm spent roughly $1.5 billion to acquire 15,400 BTC now, it still trails behind the record set last week of 55,500 BTC (worth $5.4 billion at the time). With its latest acquisition, MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin stash has risen to 402,100 BTC, bought at an average price of $58,263. This means that the firm has spent almost $23.5 billion to accumulate its Bitcoin holdings. Given the asset’s current price of just over $95,000, this puts the value of the stash at well above $38 billion – or a paper gain of nearly $15 billion. Blockstream’s co-founder and long-time Bitcoin supporter Adam Back commented on Saylor’s post, saying that “suckers” sold their BTC at prices below $100,000 to Saylor and MicroStrategy over the weekend.

Here's the Reason for the Drop!,"An unexpected event occurred in the price of Stargate Finance (STG), which is listed on Binance. The STG price lost 87% of its value in seconds on Binance, causing investors to panic. STG price dropped to as low as $0.0525 but then quickly recovered to around $0.38. Experts predict that low liquidity in the trading pair and a massive sell-off could be behind this sudden and sharp decline. Experts also noted that this decline in STG once again shows the importance of staying away from too much leverage and that trading without a stop-loss is risky, even in a bull market. What is Stargate Finance (STG)? Stargate Finance (STG) is a multi-chain native asset bridge designed to solve the blockchain trilemma that says no blockchain can be decentralized, secure, and fast at the same time. It does this by simplifying cross-chain DeFi transactions that allow users to transfer and exchange their assets between different blockchains, layer-2 networks, and decentralized applications (dApps) almost instantly. Stargate users can also move their assets between different liquidity pools on various decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and dApps. The protocol supports transfers between eight chains: Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), Polygon, Metis, BNB Chain, Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), and Fantom (FTM). *This is not investment advice.

The filing positions the asset manager among a growing list of firms aiming to introduce XRP-based investment products. According to a December 2 filing , the Bank of New York Mellon will act as the administrator for the proposed trust. WisdomTree’s ETF Aims to Track Price of XRP The ETF aims to track the price of XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. While details regarding the exchange venue and ticker symbol remain undisclosed, the filing signals WisdomTree’s intent to expand its crypto-focused offerings. WisdomTree joins other asset managers, such as Bitwise and Canary Capital, which have also submitted applications for XRP ETFs earlier this year. The company recently established a trust entity in Delaware to support the fund’s creation. The filing comes as Ripple Labs continues its legal battle with the SEC over XRP’s regulatory status, leaving the approval of such products uncertain. However, industry analysts speculate that SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s expected resignation could pave the way for a more favorable regulatory environment, potentially easing the path for XRP-based ETFs under new leadership.

The rebranded ETP initially launched in 2022 under the name ETC Group Physical XRP, represents Bitwise’s strategic efforts to strengthen its presence in Europe following its acquisition of the ETC Group earlier this year. Ripple , the blockchain company behind XRP, has also announced plans to invest in this revamped product. In another development, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is reportedly poised to approve Ripple Labs’ RLUSD, an overcollateralized stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. Ripple is preparing for a potential launch as early as December 4. Bitcoin ETFs See $6.4 Billion in Inflows in November November was a historic month for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, with investors pouring $6.4 billion into spot BTC ETFs. The surge in inflows coincided with a month-long rally that saw Bitcoin’s price soar by 45%, reaching an all-time high of $99,000. Data from Farside Investors revealed that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF dominated the inflows, accounting for $5.6 billion—or nearly 87%—of the total. Other major contributors included Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, which attracted $962 million, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF with $211.5 million, and the VanEck Bitcoin ETF at $71.2 million. The bullish momentum was driven by strong market sentiment, with Bitcoin’s price climbing from $68,000 at the start of November to its record-breaking peak. Analysts believe the consistent inflow of funds from both institutional and retail investors will sustain the ongoing rally as Bitcoin enters a critical price discovery phase. Despite the inflows, some ETFs recorded significant outflows, totaling $411 million. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF led the losses, with $364 million in outflows, followed by Bitwise Bitcoin ETF at $40.4 million and Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund at $6.8 million.

37134472,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315080,1733145315,China’s Digital Yuan Still Encounters Challenges in Adoption: Report,"China’s digital yuan, the country’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) , is facing significant hurdles in gaining widespread adoption. Despite an ambitious rollout that began in 2019, user reluctance and competition from entrenched mobile payment systems like Alipay and WeChat Pay continue to impede progress. Adoption Challenges for the Digital Yuan Charles Chang, director of the Fintech Research Centre at Fudan University, explained that “the digital yuan is facing some bottlenecks in adoption today.” In a recent interview on December 1 with the South China Morning Post, Chang attributed these challenges to the well-established user base of existing platforms, which makes it difficult for consumers to transition to the state-backed currency. China’s digital yuan program has been gradually expanded, with pilot projects now active in 26 regions across 17 provinces. However, there is still no official timeline for a nationwide rollout, signaling the government’s cautious approach amid these persistent challenges. It was revealed earlier that the digital yuan project “failed,” citing this as a sign of President Xi Jinping’s “weakening power.” China faces a choice between allowing the yuan to depreciate in the face of expected tariffs (and risk triggering a negative reaction from Trump that leads to more tariffs) or waiting for the actual imposition of tariffs before allowing the yuan to move. 1/ pic.twitter.com/dUSgeO8k4b — Brad Setser (@Brad_Setser) November 26, 2024 China’s mobile payment market is currently dominated by Alipay, which Ant Group operates, and Tencent’s WeChat Pay. Together, these platforms handle a significant portion of the country’s digital transactions. China has approximately 185 licensed non-bank payment institutions, further emphasizing the crowded nature of the digital payments ecosystem. Competition from Mobile Payment Giants Even with the digital yuan reaching a cumulative transaction value of 7.3 trillion yuan (approximately $1.02 trillion) as of July 2024, experts remain skeptical about its ability to compete effectively. Chen Zhiwu, chair professor of finance at the University of Hong Kong, noted that the digital yuan “cannot fundamentally break free from the broader limitations of the yuan’s appeal,” referring to the existing dominance of other payment options and the currency’s limited global reach. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) continues to push the digital yuan as part of its efforts to lead in the global CBDC race. Despite allegations of corruption against Yao Qian, the former head of the PBOC’s digital currency institute, the initiative remains a cornerstone of China’s financial innovation strategy. However, users’ reluctance to adopt the digital yuan highlights deeper issues. Observers believe the state will focus on incentivizing businesses and consumers to adopt it while addressing key concerns such as privacy and usability. China’s latest innovation in digital yuan adoption is the introduction of a physical CBDC card featuring dynamic QR codes and offline payment capabilities. First showcased at the 18th Shenzhen International Financial Expo, the card functions like a traditional debit card, supporting tap-to-pay and scan-to-pay options. In Chinese supermarkets, facial recognition or QR code scan (linked to your CBDC account) now is mandatory for paying your goods. Many places don't accept cash anymore.

Alongside the US and the UK, China’s involvement in these issues underscores the complexities of gaining public trust and navigating competitive financial ecosystems, which also impacts the adoption of state-backed innovations like the digital yuan.

Speaking to CNBC, Shirzad highlighted the potential for rapid advancements, emphasizing the Republican Party’s control over the presidency, House, and Senate as pivotal for pro-crypto policies. Legislative Momentum Builds for Crypto Frameworks Shirzad described the incoming government as the most pro-crypto Congress in history. “We have an extraordinarily pro-crypto president coming into office,” he remarked at a Coinbase-backed event in the U.K. The Republican trifecta in government is expected to smooth the path for two key pieces of legislation that aim to establish clear rules for the digital asset market. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, which sets a legal framework for cryptocurrencies, has already passed in the House. Meanwhile, the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, focusing on licensing stablecoin issuers, awaits a House vote. Shirzad expressed optimism about the bills’ eventual passage, though he noted a slim chance for movement during the current lame-duck session. He anticipates significant legislative action by 2025, potentially delivering long-awaited clarity for the 50 million Americans invested in cryptocurrency. The Role of Advocacy and Lobbying Trump victory also underscores the increasing influence of the crypto lobbying machine. According to Federal Election Commission data, crypto-related political action committees (PACs) raised over $245 million in the run-up to the elections. Coinbase-backed advocacy group Stand With Crypto played a critical role, grading lawmakers on their crypto stances and helping nearly 300 pro-crypto candidates secure seats in Congress. The regulatory landscape could see further shifts with the departure of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who will step down on Jan. 20, coinciding with Trump administration’s inauguration. Gensler’s tenure was marked by aggressive enforcement actions in the crypto space, which many in the industry viewed as stifling innovation. Shirzad refrained from speculating on Gensler’s replacement but expressed confidence in Trump’s ability to appoint a leader aligned with his crypto-friendly vision. “As long as he picks someone who’s a change agent, it will benefit the U.S., society, and crypto holders,” Shirzad stated.

37136412,https://invezz.com/?p=2324973,1733145103,These 6 cryptos will lead the 2025 alltcoin season,"Another altcoin season is about to dawn on the cryptocurrency market when rival cryptocurrencies outperform established coins and draw investor attention. A small number of cryptocurrencies are likely to lead the next market explosion as blockchain technology develops and popular acceptance rises. This paper highlights six cryptocurrencies—including Rexas Finance (RXS)—that are ready to rule the altcoin season in 2025. Rexas Finance (RXS): Redefining real-world asset tokenization Tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), including real estate, commodities, and collectables, Rexas Finance is transforming the financial scene. Using blockchain technology, this creative platform transforms usually illiquid assets into liquid and easily accessible forms, democratizing investing possibilities for worldwide players. The Rexas Finance presale has attracted much interest since it shows how likely it is to lead the next bull run. Currently, in Stage 8, the RXS token costs $0.10; the next stage will see a targeted rise to $0.125. An amazing 277,205,500 tokens in this stage have already been sold, generating $19,470,777. The presale has passed several phases, each showing rising investor confidence. From Stage 1, $0.03, to Stage 7, where tokens were sold for $0.09, investor confidence has been shown. The potential of Rexas Finance resides in its robust ecosystem as much as in its disciplined presale plan. While Rexas GenAI lets consumers easily manufacture NFTs, its QuickMint Bot streamlines token creation. The top importance is security, which a CertiK audit confirms to inspire investor confidence. Early investors could get 2x profits at debut with an anticipated listing price of $0.20 and long-term growth potential if the platform acquires traction. Rexas Finance’s emphasis on real-world asset tokenization puts it first in the 2025 altcoin season as the crypto ecosystem evolves toward useful applications. RXS is thus a must-watch token. Audium (AUDIO): Blockchain empowers artists Designed as a distributed music-sharing tool, Audius transforms the relationship between musicians and fans. Traditional platforms often involve middlemen, limit artists’ creative freedom, and lower their income. Audius uses blockchain technology to provide a transparent, fair ecosystem, therefore addressing these obstacles. The AUDIO token running the platform makes staking, governance, and transactions possible. Artists can connect directly with their followers, mint NFTs, and offer unique materials. This approach increases fan involvement and artist income. Audius is the leading actor in decentralizing the music business, with significant alliances and an expanding user base. AUDIO will flourish during the 2025 altcoin season as the need for creator-first platforms rises. Chiliz (CHZ): Changing sporting fan engagement Through its blockchain-based system, Chiliz is transforming fan involvement and allowing sports teams to issue fan tokens. While strengthening relationships with their preferred teams, these tokens enable supporters to influence decisions, including club slogans and jersey designs. The CHZ cryptocurrency supports staking and transactions, fueling this ecosystem. Chiliz’s Socios.com platform has attracted alliances with worldwide sports heavyweights, including FC Barcelona, Manchester City, and Juventus, showcasing the broad acceptance of her technology. Chiliz is truly the one who can spearhead the offensive regarding blockchain’s expansion into mainstream industries, thus making CHZ one of the top contenders for the altcoins of 2025. SingularityDAO (SDA): AI enhancements in portfolio management Combining artificial intelligence with blockchain, SingularityDAO presents distributed asset management solutions. The platform uses AI-driven techniques to maximise portfolio performance utilizing its Dynamic Asset Manager (DAM) capabilities, offering retail and institutional clients a modern investment approach. The SDAO token is essential in staking and governance, complementing the platform’s goal of democratizing complex financial instruments. SingularityDAO’s creative ideas should become more popular as artificial intelligence adoption picks up speed, establishing SDAO as a leader in the developing blockchain-based financial industry. Given its emphasis on AI and blockchain integration, SDAO will likely be a top performer in the 2025 cryptocurrency season. VeChain (VET): Transforms supply chains VeChain is a blockchain as a service (BaaS) that promotes effectiveness and visibility within the supply chain. It assists businesses in tracking products using blockchain technology, verifying authenticity, and simplifying processes, thus addressing serious challenges in global supply chains. While its relationships with business giants like BMW, PwC, and Walmart China highlight its practical relevance, the VET token helps value exchanges inside the ecosystem. VeChain’s dual-token structure guarantees dependability and scalability, which appeals to businesses. VeChain’s relevance will only become more important as global supply chain issues affect us, making VET a unique altcoin in 2025. Rendering Tokens (RNDR): Decentralizing GPUs Render Token links producers with underused GPU power over a distributed network, transforming the rendering process. For artists, filmmakers, and game developers, this method lowers expenses and improves accessibility, therefore allowing high-quality rendering services free from conventional limitations. The RNDR token facilitates these transactions, establishing a flawless environment for GPU owners and developers. Demand for dispersed rendering solutions will explode as sectors such as gaming, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence grow. Given its original value proposition and increasing acceptance, Rendering Token is poised to be very important in the next altcoin season. Conclusion Driven by initiatives that mix creativity with practical use, the 2025 altcoin season promises hitherto unheard-of chances for investors. Leading the charge with its emphasis on actual asset tokenization, Rexas Finance provides revolutionary ideas that democratize investment. Projects like Audius, Chiliz, and VeChain all show how blockchain may upend sectors from logistics to entertainment. These six cryptocurrencies rank as leaders in the upcoming cryptocurrency bull run for investors looking for high-potential projects since they provide a special mix of innovation, utility, and market demand.

37134784,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/historical-price-trends-place-cardano-ada-at-6-heres-when,1733145007,Historical Price Trends Place Cardano (ADA) at $6: Here’s When,"With a bold forecast for Cardano (ADA), crypto researcher Ali Martinez says its price will skyrocket to $6 during this market cycle. Inspired by past performance, Martinez created a chronology showing when ADA is likely to reach this goal, which excited investors. But among this hope, rumors of another cryptocurrency—one on a similar trajectory but ready to outperform ADA by hitting an amazing $10 within the same period—are getting more audible. Leading creativity in the unexplored field of real-world asset tokenization, this mystery token offers early investors unmatched returns. When Cardano Price Will Reach $6 Analyst Ali Martinez, in an X article, estimated Cardano would hit the $6 milestone between July and September 2025. His forecast is based on past experience of ADA, which shows its amazing price success in past bull runs. Between November 2020 and its all-time high (ATH) of $3.10 in September 2021, Cardano underwent an astounding surge of nearly 4,000%, according to Martinez's accompanying chart. He sees a similar boom underway and projects a 2,200% increase to drive ADA to $6.2. It seems as though this rally started already. According to CryptoRank data, ADA has surged over 90% from the beginning of November 2024, rising 20% only in the previous 24 hours alone. This price movement aligns with notable events, including Bitwise seeking a multi-crypto ETF featuring ADA and Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson joining the Trump administration as a crypto advisor. Although Cardano's path is remarkable, another coin that offers significantly more rewards is also under increasing attention. Targeting an unrealized market, this new concept redefines investment choices rather than merely following the bull run. Real-world asset tokenization. Introducing the Next Big Opportunity: Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance lets users tokenize almost any real-world asset, therefore changing the field of asset management. From real estate and art to intellectual property and goods, Rexas Finance offers a smooth portal to a future free of limitations on asset liquidity. Leveraging blockchain technology, the platform democratizes investing, hence increasing its inclusiveness, transparency, and efficiency. Rexas Finance leads the way providing a safe and creative way to tokenize assets as the world welcomes blockchain's transforming power. Together with its unusual presale strategy, this goal has driven unheard-of demand for its native coin, RXS. Unlike many blockchain initiatives depending on venture money, Rexas Finance used a community-first strategy and developed a devoted network of individual investors. With its presale in Stage 6, where tokens are priced at $0.08 each, this approach has driven the project ahead. Rexas Finance has raised $9,901,248 as of writing from its $12,200,000 target; out of the 200,000,000 available, 171,263,338 tokens have been sold. Listing at $0.20 on three exchanges in early 2025, RXS guarantees a 150% return for present investors. Having listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, the project has attracted a lot of interest and has been further supported by a CertiK evaluation stressing security and openness, hence strengthening investor confidence. Additionally increasing exposure is the $1 million RXS token giveaway awarding 20 winners $50,000 worth of RXS tokens each. Over 240,300 entries show increasing enthusiasm around the project. Participants are urged to finish tasks on the Rexas Finance website, therefore enhancing their chances of winning and offering insights on the innovative possibilities of the platform. Rexas Finance is positioned to see its first significant bull run next to the general market climb. Rising investor confidence and a creative approach to real-world asset tokenization allow analysts to estimate a 12,400% increase for RXS, therefore rallying to $10 within the same timeframe as Cardano's $6 forecast. For those looking for exponential gains in the quickly changing blockchain environment, this offers an amazing possibility. Final Thought Cardano's path to $6 emphasizes the great promise of already existing cryptocurrencies concerning market cycles. Still, the emergence of Rexas Finance highlights the fascinating prospects in developing countries, such as actual asset tokenization. Rexas Finance is positioned to not only match Cardano's timeframe but also provide innovative gains with its community-driven presale success, creative platform, and ambitious aims. Now is the time for investors ready to welcome blockchain innovation to think about RXS before its price rises beyond reach.

37135196,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51182,1733144619,Analyst Projects Timeline For XRP to Hit $18 and $150,"EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), a well-known analyst in the cryptocurrency community, recently shared an ambitious projection for XRP’s price movement over the next two months. According to his analysis, XRP could reach $18 by December 2024 and an extraordinary $150 by January 2025. These predictions are based on historical price patterns and aim to provide a framework for investors looking to make the most from their investment in the digital asset. Historical Comparisons and Key Projections EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis examines XRP’s performance during past bull markets. The projection is segmented into three key phases, represented by distinct candles on the chart. November 2024 – The Yellow Candle: XRP surged 300% in November. The analyst noted that this move closely mirrors the 328% surge observed in November 2017. This surge helped XRP reclaim the $2 level as experts predicted , and this has set the stage for December’s anticipated price movements. December 2024 – The Green Candle: EGRAG CRYPTO predicts that XRP could experience an 830% increase in December, pushing the price to $18. This is aligned with historical data from 2017 when a similar candle displayed extreme volatility, including a 60% price drop within the same month. Investors are cautioned to prepare for such fluctuations if this scenario unfolds. January 2025 – The White Candle: The analyst suggests a 713% surge in January, potentially driving XRP’s price to $150. This forecast is grounded in past patterns observed during the 2017 bull run when XRP exhibited exponential growth in the early stages of the year to hit its all-time high of $3.84. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Purple Candle and Considerations for the Coming Surge EGRAG CRYPTO deliberately excluded the fourth candle, represented in purple, to maintain a conservative outlook. The purple candle in 2017 was the final push that sent the digital asset to its all-time high, and EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis shows that the digital asset will climb far above $150 with this candle. While the projections are compelling, EGRAG CRYPTO stresses the importance of approaching them as a framework rather than a certainty. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and he noted that although the possibilities for XRP are endless, there are also risks. Whales and institutional investors are already accumulating tokens in anticipation of this bull run. EGRAG CRYPTO advises investors to focus on strategy, position themselves wisely, and prepare for bulls and bears. The unpredictable market requires a steady mindset and a disciplined approach to risk management. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

37133738,https://blockworks.co/news/how-blockchain-chain-abstraction-is-finally-coming-to-life,1733144400,How blockchain chain abstraction is finally coming to life,"Web3’s great long-standing battle with fragmentation—one of the leading causes behind the industry’s notoriously poor cross-chain UX—may finally be put to rest as a new era—the Abstraction Age—emerges. We’re arriving at a stage where chain abstraction is no longer just a distant concept: it’s becoming a reality, paving the way for a truly connected Web3, making global interconnectivity more attainable than ever. At this breakthrough point, we’re also witnessing the surfacing of the first chain-abstracted consumer products—the most compelling of them being Particle Network’s recently released UniversalX. This article will review chain abstraction, its positioning level to up Web3, UniversalX’s workings to enable chain-agnostic trading, and the landscape of chain-abstracted consumer-facing products as we enter the Abstraction Age. Get familiar with chain abstraction Typically, blockchains have operated largely as isolated networks where users and liquidity sit in silos. Instead of simply being able to focus on engaging with applications and derive benefits from their utilities, users have needed to manage and navigate multiple wallets, a variety of gas tokens, and multi-step manual bridging processes. Not only has this created unnecessary complexity, but it has also limited collaborative potential across blockchain ecosystems. Bitcoin brought you sovereign digital assets. Ethereum decentralized the Internet. L2s made blockchains quick and affordable. Chain abstraction is the last piece of the puzzle, uniting Web3 into a single platform. — Particle Network (@ParticleNtwrk) October 8, 2024 Chain abstraction, a narrative that has seen prolific growth this year, represents Web3’s organic solution to these issues, and today, it’s more than just a concept—it signifies a transformative, unified experience of seamless interactions across chains. By decoupling blockchain interactions from network complexities, chain abstraction makes cross-chain interactions feel as simple and accessible as using the Internet. To learn more about chain abstraction, read our comprehensive guide . Let’s now review UniversalX and its role as the first fully chain-abstracted consumer product Web3. UniversalX – bringing chain abstraction to the masses UniversalX, built leveraging Particle Network’s Universal Accounts (“one account, one balance, any chain”) is an all-in-one chain-abstracted trading platform, bringing the ease of use typically reserved for centralized exchanges into the permissionless, fully-on-chain world. Historically, decentralized apps lacked the sophistication and user experience needed to rival their centralized counterparts. By bringing on-chain trading into the Abstraction Age, UniversalX now demonstrates how chain-abstracted decentralized applications can challenge and potentially overtake centralized protocols and companies in terms of ease of use and user experience. How does UniversalX work? UniversalX is enabled by Universal Accounts, which give users a unified account and balance across every chain, allowing them to engage seamlessly with any chain without the need for bridging. Currently, they support the entire EVM ecosystem and Solana, with plans to expand to other ecosystems. Through Universal Accounts, UniversalX is able to offer users a decentralized, fully self-custodial experience that streamlines complex cross-chain interactions and enhances user accessibility to the broader Web3 ecosystem. It’s a compelling CEX-equivalent experience, but completely on-chain. Get the latest UniversalX updates: https://blog.particle.network/ Across its experience, the defining feature that sets UniversalX apart from similar products is its approach to chain abstraction. This allows users to trade seamlessly across different chains without the need for bridging or managing the complexity of interacting with multiple networks. With this defining component in place, users gain: Unified multi-chain balance: enables users to transact using tokens from various chains in the same transaction. Automatic cross-chain execution: offers near-instant settlement with minimal additional gas costs. Gas payment flexibility: users can pay fees with any token on any chain. any time somebody says ""there's too many chains, it won't work"" I think about how it'll be even easier to navigate thousands of chains with solutions like @ParticleNtwrk than it is to navigate hundreds of chains without it today — Juan (@juanaxyz00) October 17, 2024 But surely, the “CEX-equivalent experience” must be hyperbole; just marketing jargon, right? Wrong. The application’s interface, while simple and easy to use, caters to a wide range of users while still offering a powerful suite of features that ensure even prolific traders aren’t missing key elements of the trading experience. UniversalX’s features lineup includes: Fiat on/off ramps: Supports the purchase and sale of crypto and fiat for thousands of assets, including meme tokens. Speedy transactions: Executes near-instantly, even for multi-chain operations. Minimalistic interface: Allows users to follow tokens, find trading opportunities, and transact within an interface streamlined for efficiency. Fiat onboarding: Facilitates direct payments in cash or crypto for thousands of tokens, including meme tokens, across any chain. Decentralized and non-custodial: Empowers users to retain full control over their assets and perform all trades on-chain with secure, non-custodial functionality. UniversalX brings a more intuitive on-chain trading experience, demonstrating how chain abstraction is steadily advancing the Web3 vision. With plans for continuous updates and feature enhancements, UniversalX is positioned to evolve alongside the needs of users and remain at the bleeding edge of chain abstraction development. As onboarding accelerates and the application continues to improve, it’s reasonable to expect that UniversalX could add significant fuel to Web3 industry’s already fast-growing demand for chain abstraction-powered applications. Additional standout chain abstraction developments Particle Network isn’t the only noteworthy undertaking dedicated to bringing chain abstraction to life. Projects like Polygon’s AggLayer, Optimism’s Superchain, and Socket Protocol are also helping lead the charge to make a seamless Web3 experience possible. Each of these initiatives brings chain abstraction to life in distinct ways—whether through bridging, multi-chain orchestration, or unified Layer-2 solutions. By abstracting backend complexities, these projects aim to remove the friction that has historically limited blockchain interactions, making decentralized applications more accessible and intuitive for both developers and end-users alike. Here’s a look at how each project is implementing chain abstraction to streamline the multi-chain experience. AggLayer by Polygon AggLayer, a Polygon initiative , introduces chain abstraction to tackle the current challenges of blockchain interoperability. Its core mission is to integrate the strengths of monolithic and modular scaling approaches, creating a unified experience where users can seamlessly interact with dApps across Layer-1 and Layer-2 ecosystems. The AggLayer aims to establish secure, atomic interoperability between diverse blockchains. By leveraging ZK-proofs for security, the protocol preserves the modularity and sovereignty of connected chains while ensuring a seamless, user-centric experience akin to monolithic systems. The bridgeAndCall() feature is central to AggLayer’s capabilities, abstracting complex cross-chain processes into single transactions. This simplifies user interactions and empowers developers to build applications that mask underlying chain complexity, making AggLayer’s approach feel similar to the internet—transparent and seamless. For example, a user could transfer an asset, swap it for another, and interact with a dApp on a different chain without manual navigation. This approach not only improves user experience but expands design options for developers, allowing them to scale applications across networks without sacrificing security or encountering fragmented liquidity. AggLayer’s user-centric focus addresses longstanding blockchain barriers, moving the technology forward with impactful use cases. Superchain by Optimism Optimism’s Superchain represents an ambitious approach to chain abstraction, targeting integration and interoperability of Layer-2 solutions within the Ethereum ecosystem. This infrastructure enables dApps on the Ethereum Mainnet to extend seamlessly onto connected Layer-2 chains, enhancing user experience while leveraging a shared security model that upholds Ethereum’s trusted framework. Although the Superchain aims to simplify user interactions and minimize the need for bridging assets, some user-initiated actions may still be required, as full abstraction relies on future development. The Superchain’s design helps consolidate resources across chains, improving interoperability and reducing fragmented liquidity. This setup is essential for scaling dApps, lowering transaction costs, and moving toward a unified application experience. The complete realization of these benefits is expected to evolve as the project progresses. The real-world impact of Optimism’s Superchain lies in making dApps more accessible by abstracting technical complexities—empowering developers to better create user-centric applications that prioritize efficiency and accessibility. This is crucial to realizing the vision of a user-friendly, highly functional Ethereum network that operates with seamless multi-layer interactions that bridge the gap between technical complexity and user experience. Socket Protocol Socket Protocol is a prominent example of the application-level or orchestration layer in chain abstraction. This protocol empowers developers to create dApps that function across multiple blockchains, offering tools like SDKs and APIs to simplify cross-chain workflows and interactions. By abstracting cross-chain transaction complexities, Socket enables developers to focus on user-centric features instead of underlying technical challenges. At the core of Socket’s orchestration capabilities is its framework for modular order flow execution, where third parties compete to fulfill user requests efficiently. This allows developers to create chain-agnostic dApps capable of managing complex cross-chain operations, such as asset or data transfers, through streamlined, coordinated processes that minimize user friction. Although these processes appear as single-user actions, they rely on off-chain agents, known as transmitters and watchers, to execute securely. Socket’s infrastructure supports asynchronous, multi-chain workflows, enhancing dApp scalability and interoperability. With this approach, Socket Protocol plays a crucial role in advancing chain abstraction, empowering developers to transcend single-chain limitations and innovate freely. This contributes to the broader vision of a cohesive, interconnected Web3 ecosystem. The Chain Abstraction Coalition: uniting blockchain ecosystems for an interconnected Web3 As the Abstraction Age drives Web3 toward a seamless, unified experience, the Chain Abstraction Coalition is central to this movement, working to bridge the gaps that traditionally isolate blockchains. Composed of major networks like Arbitrum , Avalanche , Berachain , and BNB Chain , the Coalition’s collaborative approach is set to accelerate Web3’s transition to a user-friendly landscape where blockchains operate in unison rather than as isolated silos. Most importantly, this isn’t a theoretical dream that will first take substantial development, followed by grueling BD work, to fully realize innovation benefits. Given these networks are already widely adopted among millions of Web3 users, the Coalition’s initiatives, when implemented, can make an immediately tangible impact on chain abstraction adoption that is felt industry-wide. Chains like @solana and @berachain try to build a strong brand and culture around their ecosystems. @ParticleNtwrk flips that – users directly interact with apps without thinking about the chain. Are these conflicting opinions? Will we know what chain we're on in 5 years? pic.twitter.com/ndC66CrEfR — Jack Niewold 🫡 (@JackNiewold) October 10, 2024 At the core of the Coalition’s effort are tools like Particle Network’s Universal Accounts and Universal Gas , which give users a single balance for all chains and eliminate the need for chain-specific gas tokens. This simplifies the often cumbersome process of manual chain interactions, removing a major barrier to Web3 newcomers and enhancing accessibility. Through these practical, user-focused solutions, the Chain Abstraction Coalition is laying the foundation for a unified Web3 that benefits the entire industry, making cross-chain interactions seamless and approachable, while also serving as a legitimizing stamp of approval for the significance of chain abstraction adoption. Tomorrow’s Web3 user experience brought to today’s applications As Web3 matures, chain abstraction stands out as a critical innovation, transforming the blockchain experience from a fragmented, chain-specific landscape into a cohesive, accessible ecosystem. By enabling seamless cross-chain interactions, chain abstraction paves the way for intuitive applications, unified liquidity, and interoperable user experiences, all essential for mainstream adoption. Initiatives like Particle Network’s UniversalX, Optimism’s Superchain, and Socket Protocol’s orchestration layer exemplify the impact of chain abstraction, offering users and developers the ability to experience the benefits of a CEX fully on-chain and permissionless, simplify cross-chain bridging, and create more interoperable, frictionless dApps primed for impactful adoption. As chain abstraction evolves, it promises to fulfill Web3’s potential as a truly interconnected, decentralized Internet where blockchain complexity fades into the background and innovation thrives.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Cardano’s rise above $1 sparks optimism for a $3 target, while Rexas Finance steals the spotlight with a presale promising massive short-term gains. Table of Contents Cardano whale impact raises ADA to $3 debate Rexas Finance: A rising crypto star Why now is the best time to buy RXS Cardano (ADA) is riding a bull market, rising above $1.05. The cryptocurrency market is confident, but is Cardano’s $3 price target achievable? Let’s examine Cardano’s ability to achieve this milestone and its new competitor, Rexas Finance , which could turn $544 into $54,400 in 58 days. Cardano whale impact raises ADA to $3 debate Cardano’s price momentum is rising due to increased liquidity, and analysts expect it will quickly hit its all-time high (ATH) of $3, which it briefly reached in 2021. With whale investors driving demand, the price might retest this psychological resistance and rise to $3. ADA is seeing an upsurge in whale activity, with transactions totaling $26.34 billion. According to IntoTheBlock, ADA whales now control over 41 billion tokens, and whale transactions have increased by over 60% in the last week. Amidst these activities, ADA breaks above $1, sparking positive optimism that the price may reach $2 or higher in weeks. However, the core issue remains: Could $3 be possible this cycle? Reaching the $3 milestone will take work. Cardano needs more than its current momentum. It requires factors such as a sustained Bitcoin rally, the approval of a Cardano spot ETF, and more updates to the ecosystem. While Cardano navigates its way to $3, Rexas Finance promises a bigger return in the short term as its presale fund nears $20 million. You might also like: Rexas Finance price forecast: where could RXS be in the next 12 months Rexas Finance: A rising crypto star Cardano’s performance is worth watching, but Rexas Finance attracts investors. Rexas Finance is a must-join for crypto boom riders. Why? The presale performance is incredible. Within a few months, it has raised $19.68 million, rapidly increasing token prices from $0.03 to $0.10 across eight rounds. Stage 8 is 96% complete, and the following presale stage pricing will likely rise to $0.125, indicating momentum. Unlike many new projects, Rexas Finance chose to raise funds through a public presale, ditching venture capitalists. This has helped the project attract more community-driven investors, which is good for long-term growth. After the presale, Rexas Finance will list on at least three tier-1 exchanges, indicating a massive market launch. Why the excitement? Rexas Finance tokenizes real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate, commodities, and artwork to transform asset management. Rexas Finance’s blockchain-based technology lets regular investors trade illiquid assets fractionally. The Rexas Token Builder and Rexas GenAI, which use artificial intelligence to create unique digital art and NFTs, drive the project’s ecosystem. These advanced technologies allow people to access the fast-growing NFT and digital asset markets without technological expertise. But there’s more. After completing a Certik audit, one of the industry’s most rigorous security checks, Rexas Finance ensures trust and transparency. This examination may allow investors to be certain that Rexas Finance’s platform is secure and blockchain-compliant. Rexas Finance’s recent listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which provide real-time token performance and market trends, have garnered notice. This shows the project’s growing validity and acceptance in the crypto world. Rexas Finance also runs a $1 giveaway with $50,000 in RXS tokens for the top 20 entrants. This campaign encourages community participation and allows early investors to invest in a high-growth asset. Why now is the best time to buy RXS Rexas Finance could lead the tokenization market. The project possesses blockchain innovation, real-world utility, and significant community support. Presale investors can receive 566% when the token becomes live on major exchanges for $0.20. Given the current state of the altcoin market, Rexas Finance has the potential to soar in value, much like Cardano. The next presale stage is nearing, so investors should get RXS tokens to position themselves for explosive growth in the coming months.

Considering its value, that of a cent token, few people did not understand its enormous potential. Developed as a parody of Dogecoin and lacking any actual worth, Shiba Inu started to develop silently. But Shiba Inu only gained popularity in 2021 thanks to a highly optimistic attitude in the bitcoin market, which made early investors rather rich. As Shiba Inu first entered the market in 2021, its price started to climb quickly. As the whole crypto market exploded, so did the curiosity in SHIB and other coins. Investors have grabbed the coin in a frenzy as it was gathering momentum, particularly via social media and influential figures like Elon Musk. The value of SHIB at the start of the year January 2021 was almost nothing—about $0.0000000000. Just seven months later, in October 2021, the value rocketed to a high of 0.00008941, rising almost shockingly 121,000,000%. For some early investors, this large return on investment produced some astronomical sums where $1,000 originally deposited became several million dollars. What caused this surge? Important roles were played by a confluence of elements, including the general market upswing, more social media attention, and a rising community of supporters. The growing trend of meme currencies also helped Shiba Inu since investors search for the next great possibility. Although the token still has little value concerning other well-known cryptocurrencies, its enormous community, and viral appeal allowed it to enter the mainstream and become among the most discussed success stories of 2021. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Next Undervalued Token Set to Surprise Investors Many people are guessing which underpriced coin would reflect Shiba Inu's amazing accomplishment as we forward to 2025. Rexas Finance (RXS) is one fierce competitor that might surprise investors exactly as Shiba Inu did in 2021. Rexas Finance is in its early years right now, much like Shiba Inu in 2020, but its creative approach to real-world asset tokenization is attracting a lot of interest. Rexas Finance might be the next major token to fly off with, given its presale stage 8 is almost over and its growing group of supporters. The foundation of Rexas Finance is the platform's dedication to providing everyone access to asset tokenization. Rexas Finance is committed to tokenizing practically any real-world asset—from real estate to intellectual property—through blockchain technology, thereby enabling individuals and companies. This creates a new world of opportunities for investors, therefore transforming asset ownership into a more democratic and effective form. Powerful tools on the platform let users easily manage and trade asset-backed tokens, therefore ensuring their usability. From its presale, Rexas Finance has already displayed amazing expansion. With a token price of $0.10 as of writing, the platform has raised over $19 million after finishing over 95% of its Stage 8 presale. Believing in Rexas Finance's innovative approach to asset tokenization and its possibility for large returns, investors are swarming to the project. Strong demand for the coin is shown by the presale selling 277 million of the 290 million available tokens. Further driving investor interest is Rexas Finance's recently started ""Rexas Millionaire Giveaway."" Attracting over 326,000 entries, the giveaway offers a prize pool of $1 million worth of RXS tokens. With 20 lucky winners earning $50,000 worth of RXS tokens each, the platform is generating great buzz and motivating additional individuals to make project investments. As the giveaway ends, this growing curiosity is probably going to persist and raise the value of RXS tokens. With an estimated price rise to $0.20 per token, Rexas Finance is scheduled to list its tokens on three of the top ten tier exchanges worldwide by the first quarter of 2025. Recent listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko have made tracking the token's development simpler for investors; analysts are sure Rexas Finance will explode once it reaches significant markets. Furthermore, the platform has completed its audit by Certik, therefore giving prospective investors still another degree of credibility and confidence. Rexas Finance leads the unexplored industry of real-world asset tokenization as the larger cryptocurrency market is seeing a bull run and Bitcoin prices are climbing. Demand for RXS coins is projected to rise once they are listed on exchanges, driving up prices. With some anticipating that Rexas Finance might gather up to 100,000% next year, analysts are projecting profits akin to Shiba Inu. Conclusion The development of Shiba Inu from penny crypto to a multi-billion dollar initiative in 2021 is evidence of the amazing possibilities underappreciated in cheap tokens. Right now, Rexas Finance is cheap, underestimated, and waiting for the perfect opportunity to explode—just as Shiba Inu was a few years ago. Rexas Finance can surprise investors and offer the next major crypto success story with its creative approach to real-world asset tokenization and growing community. Don't miss the chance to enter early; Rexas Finance might be the next Shiba Inu, creating millionaires in the process.

BTC is now down by 3% in a week , with the market having spent the previous seven days struggling to clear new highs. The original cryptocurrency holds on to a 37% increase in a month and a 146% gain in a year, with its move to $100,000 seemingly only a matter of time. Yet it could rise even higher than this target, with Michael Saylor’s recent pitch to Microsoft raising the possibility of a scenario where the tech giant adds as much as $4.9 trillion to its market cap by investing heavily in Bitcoin. Strong Buy Signals Emerge as Saylor Predicts Microsoft Could Add $4.9T with Bitcoin – Will BTC Hit $150K? Attending a recent meeting of Microsoft’s shareholders, the CEO of MicroStrategy shared a three-minute presentation on why the multinational tech firm should add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. My 3-minute presentation to the $MSFT Board of Directors and @SatyaNadella , articulating why the company should do the right thing and adopt #Bitcoin . pic.twitter.com/aHp91V9Slz — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 1, 2024 The foundation of Saylor’s argument revolved around the claim that Bitcoin represents the next wave of major technological progress, providing far superior “capital preservation” than previous stores of value. Saylor also forecasts that BTC’s market cap will rise from $2 trillion to $200 trillion in the next 21 years, based on previous performance. He therefore urged the company’s shareholders to seriously consider investing in Bitcoin, something which could add $4.9 trillion to Microsoft’s market cap over the next ten years. Source: MicroStrategy While there’s no real indication that Microsoft will end up doing this, the mere fact that the company invited Saylor to present on Bitcoin is significant. Combined with the arrival of a more crypto-friendly US government, it raises the possibility that Microsoft or other major corporations will begin buying up Bitcoin. This is a big part of the reason why BTC has been doing so well since last month’s election, but if we do see a major firm invest in the cryptocurrency, it could explode. Today, its chart suggests that it’s close to bouncing back up from its dive overnight. Its RSI (purple) has just recently touched an oversold 30, while its 30-period average (orange) is close to dropping below the 200-period (blue). Source: TradingView Once this happens, BTC will be in a stronger position to make more consistent gains, with the token currently struggling to break through the $100,000 barrier. Yet it certainly has the medium- and long-term momentum to break through this level sooner or later, with the coin on course to reach new highs by the end of the year. New Presale Coins Could Lift Off Next Year Bitcoin is virtually always going to perform well whenever the market performs, yet traders who want to spread their exposure to potential upside should also consider smaller cap alts. Such alts can enjoy outsized growth, given their low starting base, and this can particularly be the case with presale tokens. One of the most exciting presales coins available today is Crypto All-Stars (STARS), a new Ethereum-based coin that has raised a very impressive $7.6 million in its sale. CANT STOP! WONT STOP! Crypto All-Stars is on fire! We just passed the big 7M milestone and the future is looking big and bright for the All-Stars. Get in the presale before it’s too late here: https://t.co/sn2wtEYopZ pic.twitter.com/zuSdvOEVwW — Crypto All-Stars (@all_stars_coin) November 30, 2024 Crypto All-Stars is the first token in crypto to provide a ‘MemeVault’, enabling holders of any meme token can stake their funds. By harnessing the ERC-1155 multi-token standard, Crypto All-Stars’ contract is able to tokenize any cryptocurrency, including coins not running on the Ethereum blockchain. This could result in massive adoption and usage for the token, especially when users who stake meme coins with its protocol will receive greater rewards if they hold more STARS tokens. Investors should act quickly, since the STARS presale ends in only 18 days. They can join the offering by going to the official Crypto All-Stars website , where the coin costs $0.0016582. This is its final presale price, but given the coin’s early popularity it certainly won’t be the highest price it ever reaches.

37133233,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311281,1733143509,"Top Trader Unveils ‘Real’ Price Target for Dogecoin, Says DOGE Now in ‘Monster Uptrend’","A trader known for making timely altcoin calls is revealing his true bull market price target for memecoin Dogecoin ( DOGE ). Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 300,100 followers on the social media platform X that he believes DOGE will go much higher than most people expect. The analyst looks at Dogecoin versus Bitcoin (DOGE/ BTC ) to forecast the memecoin’s potential bull market top. “DOGE/BTC from a cycle perspective is now in a monster uptrend, it did a cycle ABC lasting from 2021-2024 which drew down 90%. I would expect DOGE/BTC to hit an all-time high this cycle and a simple 1.618 extension measured from the prior cycle is typically a good and simple measurement. That takes us to 0.00002 BTC which is 373% higher.” The analyst practices Elliott Wave theory, which states that an asset tends to continue its uptrend after completing a three-part “ABC” correction. While Bluntz thinks that DOGE/BTC will soar to 0.00002 BTC, he highlights that DOGE’s US dollar value will likely explode higher, given that he’s also bullish on Bitcoin. He notes that Bitcoin will likely see prices well above $100,000 this cycle, suggesting that 0.00002 BTC will have a much higher dollar value. “I also think BTC is going to about $140,000-ish maybe higher by the time this cycle ends. So let’s whack another 45% on top of that 373%, which gives us around about 420% (for the culture) from current levels, math is probably flawed but don’t really care you get the picture. $1 is simple and cool to say but the real target is $2.20.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, Dogecoin is trading for $0.445.

While many major projects are laying the groundwork for their next big moves, the real action might come from unexpected corners. Experts believe that five under-the-radar tokens could explode, delivering gains as high as 1,500x. Let’s take a closer look at these potential game changers and what makes them stand out. Suiruto ($SHIN): The Ninja Meme Coin Taking Utility to New Heights One of the most exciting contenders in the meme coin arena is Suiruto ($SHIN) , a unique project on the SUI blockchain. Suiruto isn’t your average meme token, it’s a fusion of ninja-themed fun and real-world blockchain utility. From the get-go, Suiruto has been turning heads. Its presale raised over 10,000 SUI in just a few hours, a testament to its strong community backing and the potential it holds. Half of its total 100 million supply was allocated to this presale, with the token’s listing price set at 50% higher than its Presale value. With these numbers, Suiruto has already generated substantial buzz. But what truly sets Suiruto apart is its ecosystem. This isn’t just about memes, it’s about creating a movement that combines community engagement with practical utility. Key Features of Suiruto: Staking Rewards: Token holders can earn passive income by staking $SHIN, adding real value to their holdings. NFT Integration: Ninja-themed exclusive NFTs provide a unique edge, offering more than just artistic value, they’re integrated into the ecosystem with special benefits. Play-to-Earn Gaming: An upcoming game will feature $SHIN as a core component, enhancing its usability and appeal. Charity : Suiruto will set aside and donate a portion of its tokens to a charitable cause voted for by the community. With its imminent listing on the Cetus Protocol at 50% higher and a passionate community rallying behind it, Suiruto is poised to make waves. Early investors stand to gain significant returns, and as the project grows, it could redefine what a meme coin can be. Join Suiruto Presale Now NEAR Protocol: A Pioneer in Scalable Decentralized Apps NEAR Protocol continues to be a go to platform for developers creating decentralized applications (dApps). Its energy-efficient sharding technology ensures scalability without compromising on performance. NEAR’s innovative solutions, like the Rainbow Bridge for Ethereum interoperability and Aurora for Layer-2 Ethereum compatibility, empower developers to push boundaries. As dApps become increasingly vital in the blockchain space, NEAR’s commitment to infrastructure makes it a solid long-term player. Jupiter (JUP): Supercharging Solana’s DeFi Ecosystem Jupiter, a liquidity aggregation engine on Solana, is revolutionizing the way assets are managed in decentralized finance (DeFi). From limit orders and automated trading strategies to perpetual trading, Jupiter offers tools that make managing digital assets more efficient and flexible. By bolstering Solana’s liquidity and expanding DeFi functionalities, Jupiter has positioned itself as a critical part of the network’s growth story. Cardano (ADA): The Future of Sustainable Blockchain Technology Cardano continues to impress with its focus on scalability, sustainability, and low transaction fees. Its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and dual-layer architecture provide a robust foundation for both developers and users. As the blockchain landscape evolves, Cardano’s energy-efficient model and commitment to innovation ensure it remains a top choice for projects seeking long-term viability.

By introducing features like zkLogin and programmable transaction blocks, Sui has made blockchain technology more accessible than ever. Focused on scalability and user experience, Sui is tackling the inefficiencies of current systems, setting the stage for decentralized applications to thrive on a global scale. Conclusion: Suiruto Steals the Spotlight While projects like NEAR, Jupiter, Cardano, and Sui are making significant strides, Suiruto ($SHIN) emerges as a standout in this Alt-season.

With its early success, ambitious roadmap, and innovative features, Suiruto is well positioned to be a top performer in the months ahead.

42416305,c6f493a0-d481-4c96-857d-9e51b216c195,1733143229,BTC Dominance Tumbles as Altcoins Rumble: Crypto Daybook Americas,"By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)  Bitcoin is starting the week on a despondent note, trading 2% lower at $95,000 amid risk-off sentiment in traditional markets. European stocks are falling and the euro is diving against the dollar as concern the French government is on the verge of collapse pushes its bond yields to levels matching those of debt-ridden Greece.  BTC's decline follows a failed attempt to break through the multimillion-dollar wall of sell orders near $100,000 over the weekend and MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor's bitcoin presentation to Microsoft.   Still, bulls shouldn't lose hope just yet, because the supply scarcity is real, with nearly 75% of bitcoin classified as illiquid and less than 14% in centralized exchanges, according to Andre Dragosch of Bitwise.  There's chatter about countries adopting BTC as a strategic reserve, with a Middle Eastern nation potentially unveiling something big at the Abu Dhabi Finance Week that runs Dec. 9-12. The noise could get louder as the event draws close.  Ether's technical analysis is particularly bullish, reminiscent of BTC's positioning in mid-October, which was signaling a massive rally even before the U.S. elected crypto-friendly Donald Trump as president.   Market flows are on the same page. On Friday, net inflows into nine ether ETFs listed in the U.S. hit nearly $333 million. That's even more than the BTC funds' $320 million. Talk about the change in market leadership. In addition, ETH whales have snapped up ETH worth $5.7 billion in 20 days, according to IntoTheBlock.  Meanwhile, XRP has surged over 27% in just 24 hours, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value and pushing Tether's USDT to fourth place. The rally was accompanied by record volumes in South Korea, indicating strong retail participation. While a surge of 350% in four weeks may look overstretched, that's not necessarily the case. XRP's market value-to-realized value (MVRV) ratio, a popular metric modeled alongside the price-to-book ratio in equities and tracked by Santiment, has bounced only to its lifetime average, meaning prices need to rise more before we can start talking about overvaluation.   On the macro front, this week's focus is the U.S. ISM non-manufacturing PMI on Wednesday, along with Friday's payrolls and average hourly earnings report. If the employment component and wage growth exceed expectations, the dollar could get a lift while trimming Fed rate-cut bets. Additionally, there's talk of more easing from China, though the impact of earlier measures has been downplayed. Stay alert!    What to Watch  Crypto:  Dec. 18: CleanSpark (CLSK) Q4 FY 2024 earnings.

It tripled in price over the weekend after debuting at a $1 billion market cap. The token is now trading at $8.57 after touching a record high of $9.79.  Unlike many other generic native tokens that offer utility through governance votes, HYPE can be staked to secure HyperBFT, the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm that powers the HyperLiquid exchange. It is also being used as the primary token for paying transaction fees on the network.  True to its ticker, the token garnered notable attention among crypto enthusiasts on X (the so-called Crypto Twitter community) with almost all of the well-known influencers mentioning, recommending and occasionally scrutinizing it.   The bull case for HYPE is in the tokenomics because supply is skewed toward the community as opposed to venture capitalists and early investors. As a result, it is trading more like a meme coin with a viral following without the risk of supply suppression by anyone who bought in a funding round at a cheaper price.  Quant trader Flood, who goes under the X account @ThinkingUSD, wrote that they were “adding huge” under $4 on the day of release. Since then trading terminal Insilico announced it was strategically accumulating a HYPE reserve, allocating 25% of weekly revenue.    Derivatives Positioning  The three-month basis in BTC and ETH futures on offshore exchanges has softened from weekend highs, suggesting a moderation in bullish sentiment.  Perpetual funding rates across the broader market are normalizing, which could pave the way for a more sustained price rally.  In the options market, calls for BTC and ETH are still trading at a premium to puts. However, ETH calls are more expensive than BTC calls, indicating bullish expectations for ether relative to bitcoin.  IBIT and MSTR's high implied volatility has sparked interest in covered call strategies.

Russia’s Central Bank Acknowledges ‘Short-Term’ Impact on Ruble Exchange Rate (The Moscow Times): On Friday, Russia’s Central Bank attributed the ruble’s drop to U.S. sanctions on Gazprombank while expressing confidence in its own actions, including halting foreign currency purchases and maintaining a 21% interest rate.

With the market constantly evolving, it can be tricky to pick the right ones to add to your portfolio. But don’t worry—today, we’ve got you covered. Let’s talk about three projects making big moves in the crypto space: Qubetics, Near Protocol, and Polygon.

Solana has become a standout player with its ability to handle lightning-fast transaction speeds, making it a favourite for developers and businesses alike. On the other hand, Cardano is pioneering eco-friendly blockchain technology, earning its place as the go-to platform for sustainability-conscious projects. Both are reshaping how blockchain is used in gaming, finance, and even day-to-day transactions. Meanwhile, Qubetics ($TICS) addresses a key blockchain challenge by connecting isolated networks with its groundbreaking Web3 aggregated chain. By enabling seamless asset transfers and data sharing across networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, Qubetics is unlocking new possibilities for users and businesses. With over 251 million tokens sold and a presale price of just $0.025 in its 10th stage, $TICS is quickly becoming a favourite for those looking for innovation and investment potential. Let’s dive into what makes these three projects stand out. Qubetics Connects Blockchains With Interoperability Now, let’s talk about Qubetics. Unlike Solana or Cardano, Qubetics is focused on fixing a key blockchain issue—interoperability. Most blockchains operate in silos, making it tricky to move assets or data between them. Qubetics tackles this by creating a Web3 aggregated chain that links networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Here’s an example: imagine a small business owner who wants to accept payments in different cryptocurrencies. With Qubetics, they can do this seamlessly without juggling multiple wallets or dealing with conversion headaches. It’s a practical, user-friendly solution that works for businesses and individuals alike. Why Qubetics Presale Is Gaining Momentum Now for the exciting part—the Qubetics presale . Currently in its 10th phase, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.025, with over 251 million tokens sold to more than 5,300 holders. This presale has already raised $3.9 million, and with prices set to increase by 10% in just a few days, time is running out to get in early. Let’s crunch some numbers. If you invest $600 at the current price, you’ll get 24,000 $TICS tokens. When $TICS hits $0.25 at the end of the presale, your investment jumps to $6,000—that’s an 871% ROI. Analysts predict $TICS could climb to $15 after the mainnet launch, turning your $600 investment into a staggering $360,000. If that’s not a compelling reason to act now, I don’t know what is. Solana Delivers Unmatched Speed And Scalability If there’s one blockchain pushing the boundaries of speed and scalability, it’s Solana. With its ability to process over 65,000 transactions per second, Solana has become a favourite for developers building decentralised apps (dApps). Its low transaction fees and fast processing times make it the go-to platform for DeFi, gaming, and NFT projects. What’s impressive is Solana’s unique Proof-of-History mechanism, which enables these lightning-fast speeds while keeping things secure. It’s why so many developers and businesses have flocked to the platform. If you’re into cutting-edge blockchain tech, Solana is one of the best crypto to buy now. Cardano Is Changing The Game With Sustainability Cardano is like the environmentally conscious friend of the blockchain world. It uses a proof-of-stake model, which consumes significantly less energy than traditional systems, making it ideal for users and developers who care about sustainability. But there’s more to Cardano than just being green. It takes a research-driven approach, meaning every upgrade is carefully planned and implemented without disrupting the network. This method has attracted a wide range of applications, from DeFi platforms to NFTs. If you’re after innovation and sustainability, Cardano is a top contender for the best crypto to buy now. Conclusion Solana is pushing blockchain limits with its speed, Cardano is revolutionising the space with its sustainable approach, and Qubetics is solving real-world problems while offering jaw-dropping investment potential. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy now, Qubetics is the clear choice, especially with its presale nearing the next phase.

37132768,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656248,1733142609,"Fantom Price Breakout: Analyst Shares Anatomy Of FTM’s 18,000% Move To $150 By 2025","A recent technical analysis on TradingView has drawn attention to the Fantom price, with a projected 18,000% increase to reach $150 by 2025. Ultra-bullish predictions are common in the crypto market, but this one is exceptionally optimistic for Fantom. The technical analysis, which dates back to the crypto’s price action in late 2020, bases the ultra-bullish prediction on historical price trends and technical patterns forming on the Fantom price chart. Anatomy Of FTM’s 18,000% Move The analyst’s prediction begins by highlighting Fantom’s significant price correction of 70% from its 2021 all-time high of $3.46. Despite this, technical indicators show that investors are now adopting a bullish outlook on the cryptocurrency. The 10-day Fantom/TetherUS chart reveals resistance breakouts in both the price action and the RSI indicator , signaling a shift in momentum from bearish to bullish. Consequently, the analyst’s technical setup now indicates a bullish reversal in progress. Central to the forecast is the bull flag pattern that spans Fantom’s price movements over the past three years. Notably, recent price action has seen the Fantom price breaking above this bull flag pattern. The analyst notes that if this pattern repeats the impulsive wave seen in Fantom’s rally in 2021, the cryptocurrency could achieve another 18,000% increase. Back in 2021, this 18,000% increase saw the price of Fantom go from around $0.015 in November 2020 to $3.46 by October 2021. Although the cryptocurrency landscape has changed since then, the analyst predicted that Fantom could repeat another 18,000% move in light of the bull flag breakout. This would translate to a price of $150 from the current price level. Such a move would undoubtedly see Fantom outperforming most cryptocurrencies. Nonetheless, the analysis emphasizes the need for patience, as corrections of up to 80% may occur during the projected climb. The confluence of multiple technical indicators, visualized through red and blue arrows on the chart below, further supports the forecast. Key Resistance Levels And Risk Assessment The analyst identifies $3 as the first major resistance level, highlighted by the formation of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. Breaking through this zone would be a crucial step in validating the bullish trajectory. At the time of writing, Fantom (FTM) is trading at $1.03. Its price movements in the past seven days have traded between the upper and lower ends of $1.29 and $0.987, respectively. However, Fantom is still bullish on the larger timeframe , as it is currently up by over 61% in the past 30 days. An 18,000 projection from the current levels would require far more capital inflow than it did in 2021, when Fantom was trading around 1 cent. Regardless of how this 18,000% projection plays out, the Fantom price is on track to keep on its steady growth alongside the rest of the crypto market, especially if an altcoin season eventually rolls in.",POSITIVE,FTM,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | FTM | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fantom/fantom-price-breakout-18000-150/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

He suggests that the purchase aligns with broader expectations of regulatory clarity, as U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler is set to resign in January 2025. This resignation could pave the way for a crypto-friendly successor and a potential resolution to the long-standing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC.

Despite a surge in supply pressure as Bitcoin approaches the $95,000 support level, the altcoin segment continues to see strong performers. Helium is one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies, with its native token, HNT, increasing by 33.55% last week to reach a market price of $8.52.The HNT market capitalization is on the verge of surpassing $1.5 billion. Will the recovery rally in the HNT price push it beyond the psychological $10 mark in such a volatile market? Let's explore further.HNT Price Run Surpass $8On the daily chart, Helium's price action shows three consecutive bullish candles, with the rally beginning on Saturday, November 30. The price action registered a breakout from a falling channel pattern.Further, the breakout rally extended to a 24-hour high of $9.377. HNT price is currently trading at $8.484, reflecting an intraday gain of 5.01%. Helium Price Chart With a triple white soldier pattern (three consecutive bullish candles), Helium is challenging the 78.60% Fibonacci level. A bullish close above this level within 24 hours would confirm a new breakout rally.This resistance level had caused a failure in the bullish trend in September, triggering the falling channel pattern. Therefore, a breakout above this crucial resistance level could lead to a new 52-week high, potentially surpassing $11.16.The MACD and signal lines are in positive alignment, with an increase in positive histograms supporting the bullish trend. Additionally, the 50-day and 100-day EMAs are showing a bullish crossover, signaling the potential for an extended rally.Increased Helium Data Credits Burning Fuels the HNT Bull RunIn a recent X post , James Fayal, the founder of Zest, shared statistics supporting the bullish rally in HNT tokens. James posted data on Helium's network activity, showing a significant rise in Helium data credits burned for network usage.The statistics revealed a massive spike of over 10,000 Helium data credits burned for two consecutive days, signaling rising network usage and boosting market demand for HNT tokens. Furthermore, this has a deflationary impact on the circulating supply and increases positive sentiment due to broader adoption.https://twitter.com/JMFayal/status/1863301884083150941Helium Price TargetsThe trend-based Fibonacci levels suggest an immediate price target near the psychological $10 mark. A bull run beyond $10 could target the 1.272 Fibonacci level at $11.96.On the other hand, if the rally fails to close above the 78.60% Fibonacci level, the price may retest the 61.80% Fibonacci level, currently at $7.37, reflecting a downside risk of nearly 13%.",POSITIVE,HNT,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | HNT,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/02/helium-breaks-falling-channel-can-hnt-rally-surpass-10/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=helium-breaks-falling-channel-can-hnt-rally-surpass-10,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37141392,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103448,1733142190,Here Are Projected Timelines for Dogecoin to Hit $10,"Despite Dogecoin’s slow performance recently, top experts still think the asset would surge by 2,233% to $10. Following its remarkable rally in early November, Dogecoin (DOGE) has been hovering around the $0.4 price mark over the past week. Since the rally, Dogecoin has not registered any significant upward movement, as it keeps fluctuating around 40 cents. Despite this, market observers have remained confident about DOGE’s potential, with some predicting an incredible rally exceeding $10. Hitting a target of $10 requires Dogecoin’s price to rise by 2,233% from its current value of $0.4285. Fresh Forecasts for DOGE to Hit $10 Notably, prominent crypto analyst Dima James Potts recently forecasted that Dogecoin would exceed $10 this bull cycle. In a recent tweet, James highlighted a historical pattern observed in Dogecoin’s weekly chart. Referencing a red line on the accompanying chart, James noted that this indicator usually aligns with Dogecoin’s peak price in each market cycle. According to the expert, the red line for the ongoing cycle reflects a target of $24 for Dogecoin by 2025, with the price expected to increase over time. The expert forecasted that if the pattern repeats itself, Dogecoin’s price might exceed $10 before the end of this cycle. https://twitter.com/DimaPotts36/status/1861873671427838202In addition, pseudonymous crypto analyst Gladiator suggested that Dogecoin’s current price movements mirror those witnessed in the previous bull cycle. Based on the similarities, the analyst predicted that Dogecoin would embark on a parabolic run starting next year. They noted that this rally could see DOGE trade between $5 and $10 in the first quarter of next year. Changelly Forecast Besides James and Gladiator, other prominent crypto experts still believe Dogecoin will surge to $10 in its lifetime. For instance, analysts at crypto trading platform Changelly echoed this sentiment in their recent analysis of Dogecoin. However, they projected that DOGE would trade close to $10 by 2040, approximately 16 years from now. In 2040, Changelly experts expect Dogecoin to trade at a minimum price of $9.35, an average price of $9.84, and a maximum price of $11.19. ChatGPT Prediction Furthermore, we consulted the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT services to ascertain whether Dogecoin could hit the $10 mark in its lifetime. Interestingly, ChatGPT thinks Dogecoin can achieve this feat, forecasting a potential timeline of 5-10 years. This puts the projected timeframe for Dogecoin to hit the $10 target at 2029 - 2034. The chatbot highlighted certain factors that could propel DOGE to $10, such as Dogecoin’s continuous use as a payment method and a strong bull market led by Bitcoin and Ethereum. Other Predictions Regarding DOGE Surge to $10 In October, famous crypto expert Ali Martinez asserted that $10 is a realistic target for Dogecoin. Although he did not specify a timeline for Dogecoin’s surge to the $10 mark, he highlighted a chart showing DOGE’s uptick from the base of its weekly rising wedge. According to the analysis, if Dogecoin moves to the tip of the wedge in the chart, it will hit the $10 target. Major Threat to Dogecoin Rise to $10 Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s inflation model poses a major challenge for the asset. Every new year, Dogecoin adds 5 billion tokens to its supply, suggesting that the asset would need a higher valuation to reach the $10 target if it takes longer to achieve the milestone. To put this into perspective, with Dogecoin’s circulating supply at 147 billion tokens, DOGE would need a market cap of $1.47 trillion to clinch the $10 target. However, if another 5 billion tokens are added to the circulating supply, bringing it to 152 billion next year, DOGE would require a market cap of $1.52 trillion. Nonetheless, Dogecoin can still clinch the $10 target amid growing demand from retail and institutional investors, as well as Elon Musk’s continuous endorsement of the token. This article should not be taken as financial advice; hence, caution is necessary. At press time, DOGE trades at $0.4285, down 6.88% over the past seven days. Conversely, the token’s value has skyrocketed by 148.85% in the past 30 days and 6.41% in the past day.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/02/here-are-projected-timelines-for-dogecoin-to-hit-10/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-are-projected-timelines-for-dogecoin-to-hit-10,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37132475,https://crypto.news/?p=14315418,1733142014,Here’s why Helium Mobile surged over 100% in 24 hours,"Helium Mobile, a decentralized mobile and wireless network, surged 142% on Dec. 2 amid increasing network activity and growth in its mobile subscriber base. Helium Mobile (MOBILE) rallied to a seven-month high of $0.00257 on Dec. 2 during early Asian trading hours before settling at $0.001916, still marking a 78.7% increase over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. The altcoin’s market cap was seated at $199.2 million when writing, while its daily trading volume was up almost 10x, hovering over $193 million. Helium Mobile’s recent rally aligns with a sharp rise in Helium Data Credits (DC) usage. These credits, which are fixed-value tokens used for data transfer on the Helium Mobile network, saw a significant increase in burning activity. According to data from Dune, daily DC burned jumped by over 30%, rising from $10,606 on Nov. 31 to $13,868 on Dec. 1. Helium offers a crypto rewards program that allows users and Hotspot operators to earn IOT or MOBILE tokens to help drive its network growth. Both of these tokens can be swapped for HNT, which is the primary utility token used in the Helium Network . One reason MOBILE’s price could be rising is that traders are taking advantage of an arbitrage opportunity with HNT. According to a community member, the current HNT to MOBILE swap rate is around 5,000:1, which is significantly better than the expected final rate of 7,700:1, as outlined in Helium Improvement Proposal 138. This could prompt many investors to buy MOBILE and then exchange it for HNT to capitalize on the difference—driving demand for MOBILE in the short term and indirectly boosting demand for HNT as well.

XRP Analysis By Shayan The Weekly Chart Ripple has shown an impressive surge, climbing over 100% since last week, pushing past the $2 resistance level, and hitting $2.5 for the first time since January 2018. This strong upward movement signals a dominant buying presence in the market. The price action reflects extreme optimism, but the RSI has surged into overbought territory, suggesting the market is overheated. Such conditions often precede a period of consolidation or corrective retracements, as buyers may need time to digest the gains before pushing the price higher again. In the mid-term, the key support level to watch is the $2 threshold, which has now turned into crucial support after being reclaimed as resistance during the recent surge. A pullback toward this level would be healthy for the market, offering a chance for buyers to regroup before a potential continuation of the uptrend. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, the bullish structure is clear, with higher highs and higher lows. Ripple has successfully reclaimed several key resistance levels, including its previous ATH of $2, before surging to the new $2.5 mark. The asset recently broke above the upper trendline of an ascending channel, further emphasizing buyers’ dominance. However, the RSI on this shorter timeframe shows a notable bearish divergence, signaling that a correction is likely in the near term. With its large number of leveraged positions, the overheated futures market increases the likelihood of a liquidation cascade if the price experiences a sharp decline. This suggests that while the mid-term outlook remains bullish, short-term consolidation or a pullback is expected, potentially leading to heightened volatility.

37134470,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315005,1733141466,Coinbase Exec Predicts Stablecoin Regulations by 2025 After Trump Win,"The United States may be on the brink of a transformative moment for cryptocurrency legislation and stablecoin flexibility, with Coinbase’s Chief Policy Officer, Faryar Shirzad, predicting a fast-tracked regulatory framework once Donald Trump assumes the presidency in January 2025. Shirzad’s optimism stems from Trump’s pro-crypto platform and the Republican Party’s newfound majority control in the House of Representatives and the Senate, creating what many view as the most favorable environment for cryptocurrency policy in U.S. history. Trump, A Pro-Crypto President: Is This The Time For Crypto And Stablecoins To Shine As Coinbase Exec Predicted? Speaking to CNBC on Dec. 2 during a Coinbase-backed advocacy event in the United Kingdom, Shirzad shared the potential impact of the political shift. He highlighted that the convergence of a crypto-supportive president and Congress presents a historic opportunity for the voices of approximately 50 million American crypto owners to be reflected in policy. “We have the most pro-crypto Congress ever [in] history, we have an extraordinarily pro-crypto president coming into office.” Shirzad pointed to two key pieces of legislation already making their way through Congress. First is the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act , which seeks to establish a comprehensive legal framework for digital assets. This bill has already passed in the House of Representatives and awaits further action in the Senate. Second, the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act is designed to regulate stablecoin issuers and create a licensing regime for these digital tokens tied to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. This bill has not yet advanced to a House vote. Although the current “lame duck” session offers limited chances for immediate legislative progress, Shirzad expects substantial developments and potential passage of both bills in 2025. What’s Next for U.S. Crypto Policy? Trump’s Crypto Agenda Donald Trump’s election victory has reignited optimism within the cryptocurrency sector because of his pro-crypto campaign promises and the broader industry momentum he represents. The Republican Party’s “governing trifecta” now enables a streamlined legislative process for crypto reforms, which have long been stalled by political gridlock and regulatory uncertainty. Trump’s win also ensures the departure of SEC Chair Gary Gensler , who announced his resignation effective Jan. 20, 2025—the same day as Trump’s inauguration. SEC Chair Gary Gensler to Step Down on January 20, 2025 Gary Gensler, Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), announced in an X post on Thursday that he will step down on January 20, 2025, coinciding with the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.… — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 2, 2024 Gensler’s tenure was marked by aggressive crypto oversight, often criticized for stifling innovation through regulatory ambiguity and enforcement-heavy approaches. Shirzad declined to speculate on who Trump might appoint to lead the SEC but expressed confidence that the new administration will select someone aligned with the president-elect’s vision for fostering crypto innovation. Shirzad also noted that the legislative framework established under Trump’s administration could benefit the domestic crypto market and position the U.S. as a global leader in the digital asset space. Given the increasing use of stablecoins in global trade and payments, he highlighted stablecoin regulation as a particularly pressing issue. As the clock ticks toward Trump’s inauguration, all eyes are on how quickly Congress can deliver the promised regulatory clarity. The Financial Innovation and Technology Act and the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act represent the first major steps in establishing a comprehensive legal infrastructure for the crypto industry. However, the exact details of these laws, including potential tax implications and compliance requirements, remain to be seen. The stage is set for what could be one of the most significant periods in cryptocurrency history. As Shirzad optimistically claimed, the alignment of a pro-crypto president and Congress creates an unprecedented opportunity to unlock the full potential of digital assets in the U.S. economy.

37132113,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373055,1733141428,Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Could Slump to $80K if This Support Level Breaks,"Bitcoin’s price is consolidating below the $100K milestone, as investors are still waiting to witness a six-figure BTC price. However, the asset fell hard today, and the question remains whether that target will be achieved soon. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart As the daily chart demonstrates, the asset has been breaking through several resistance levels over the past few weeks, paving its way toward the $100K mark. However, the price has yet to reach this level, as the market is moving sideways. With the $90K support level intact, investors could be hopeful that a bullish breakout and rally above the $100K mark would materialize. Yet, if the $90K level gets broken to the downside, a significant pullback toward the $80K area could be expected. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart illustrates the recent BTC price action, as the market has been consolidating inside a symmetrical triangle pattern. These patterns can either be continuation or reversal ones, depending on the direction of the breakout. Therefore, if the market can break above the triangle, a bullish continuation toward and above the $100K mark would be likely. On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Exchange Netflow (30-Day Moving Average) It is possible to analyze the accumulation and distribution of Bitcoin in the spot market using the exchange netflow metric. It measures the net deposits and withdrawals of Bitcoin into and from centralized exchanges. Positive values show distribution, while negative numbers indicate accumulation. As the chart suggests, there have been substantial negative netflows recently, as investors are rapidly accumulating BTC in the hopes of a rally above $100K soon. The 30-day moving average of the BTC netflows has also consistently shown negative values over the past six months. As a result, if the derivatives market does not create an obstacle, the demand in the spot market will likely push the price higher in the coming months.

Where could the bounces happen?","As Bitcoin continues to head lower on its own downward trajectory, the major altcoins are following suit. What are the best potential levels to catch a bounce for Ethereum ($ETH), Solana ($SOL), and Binance Coin ($BNB)? $ETH rejected from massive triangle top Source: TradingView When looking at the $ETH price on the weekly time frame, it can be seen that a rejection has just taken place at the top trendline of the huge triangle that $ETH has been in since late 2021. That said, the price has been down and touched the bottom of the triangle, which coincided with the 0.618 Fibonacci, thus a bullish bounce. $ETH bounce or further downside? Source: TradingView The 4-hour time frame for $ETH shows the price traversing upwards in a wedge pattern. The price is currently deciding whether to bounce from the bottom of the wedge, which also coincides with the 0.236 Fibonacci ( a very bullish bounce should it happen), or perhaps to fall through the bottom of the wedge and head for one of the lower Fibonacci levels. Any of these levels would likely signal a bullish bounce. Prices can be taken from the chart above. If the price fell all the way down and below $3,000, this would potentially negate the upside trend. $SOL heading back down to major horizontal support Source: TradingView The weekly chart for the $SOL price shows that the latest big surge out of the bull flag succeeded in making a new all-time high. Instead of pushing on upwards, the $SOL price is coming down again. This is much healthier for the price overall, and it looks as though the price may come down either to the lesser support at $210, or the major support at $202. This would have the effect of building price structure on top of the bull flag and also support from the 2021 highs. $SOL lower low or bounce? Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $SOL shows how the price is rolling over. In fact, the price is currently in danger of making a lower low on this time frame. It could be that the 0.382 Fibonacci does become the bounce level, but a small slip to the downside and below $222 could mean a further drop. The 5.0 Fibonacci lines up with the support at $210, while the 0.618 Fibonacci is just below the major support level of $202. All could be potentially good levels for entering a position. $BNB rejects from top of huge range Source: TradingView The weekly time frame for $BNB is self-explanatory. The price has been in a huge range since early May 2021. The price looks to have rejected from the top of this range currently, and it just remains to be seen where a bounce could take place from. Potential entry for $BNB but set tight stop loss Source: TradingView The 4-hour time frame for $BNB displays an ascending channel which the price is currently traversing within. An excellent place to open a position could potentially be the bottom of the channel, which coincides nicely with the horizontal support at $610. Bear in mind that this strong support could fail, and so a stop loss should be employed. Lower lows below this could signal the end of the uptrend, at least for the short to medium term.

37132384,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=621427,1733141364,Stablecoin liquidity shaping altcoin markets amid Bitcoin rotation decline,"CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju has attributed the surge in altcoin trading to increased stablecoin liquidity. In a post on X, Young Ju explained that most of the trading volume for altcoins is tied to stablecoins and fiat pairs. According to him, rotation from Bitcoin no longer defines the alt season, a major departure from previous bull runs. According to Cryptoquant data, the aggregated trading volume for stablecoin pairs has reached peak levels this year, while the trading volume for Bitcoin pairs is down. Young Ju said : “Alt season is no longer defined by asset rotation from #Bitcoin. Stablecoin liquidity better explains the altcoin markets.” His comments capture the significant difference between the current and previous bull markets. Historically, the alt season, which refers to when these tokens record a surge in value and outshine Bitcoin, usually happens due to investors rotating capital out of Bitcoin into other cryptocurrencies, the alternatives. Stablecoin liquidity now defines altcoin markets better – CryptoQuant However, this has not happened, leading many market observers to question why alternative cryptos have not entered their season. Young Ju now believes that investors need to pay attention to stablecoins liquidity instead of focusing on capital rotation out of Bitcoin. Institutional interest in Bitcoin ends capital rotation to altcoins Young Ju had previously explained why the altcoin season is delayed. According to him, institutional investors and spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are driving the current Bitcoin rally, and this group does not buy on exchanges nor do they care much for Bitcoin alternatives. He said: “Unlike crypto exchange users, institutional investors and ETF buyers have no intention of rotating their assets from Bitcoin to altcoins. Moreover, as they operate outside of crypto exchanges, asset rotation becomes inherently less feasible.” The limited exposure of these institutional investors to altcoins or exchanges means that retail investors will likely be responsible for any alts season in this bull run. The analyst said: “For altcoins to reach a new all-time high market capitalization, they will require a significant influx of fresh capital to crypto exchanges. The altcoin market cap below its previous ATH indicates reduced fresh liquidity from new exchange users.” Since retail is unlikely to drive any major Bitcoin rally in the future, altcoins would have to find other ways to attract liquidity apart from relying on the Bitcoin rotation. Altcoin season might be here already While questions remain about when the alts season will start, some analysts believe that it has already started with retail selectively picking its winners. Podcaster CryptoVizArt noted that it has already started and might have even peaked with Solana. However, Young Ju did not agree fully with this opinion, noting that the altcoin season has started for some but not others. “Altseason has started for a few major altcoins, but not for others, imo. The total altcoin market cap is still below its all-time high.” Others also share this view. Crypto trader CryptoFeras noted that alt season usually happens toward the final stages of the bull cycle, and this is likely what will happen now, as is the case in every other bull cycle. The analyst explained the reason for this, noting: “Once BTC goes parabolic, media start pushing the narrative, a new wave of retail buyers will come, and as usual, they will never buy the “expensive BTC” they will be buying altcoins. that was always the case in all cycles.” Still, one coin that is currently experiencing its season is Ripple (XRP). The token has been up over 20% in the last 24 hours, peaking at $2.491. It has leapfrogged Solana in terms of market cap. For a few hours today, it even became the third biggest crypto asset, temporarily taking USDT’s position behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. Altcoin market cap breakout suggests altseason is coming – Ash Crypto Meanwhile, several other analysts believe alts season is not here yet and will happen in the next few months. Crypto trader Ash Crypto noted that the market cap breakout has finally happened, and the last time it did, alts market cap increased by 1000% in seven months.

Further, the intraday drop of 2.54% brings the Ethereum price closer to the $3600 psychological support. With its market cap hinging at $435 billion, will Ethereum crash and lose to the XRP rally? Let’s find out in this Ethereum price prediction. Ethereum Price Analysis In the 4H chart, the ETH price action showcases a broadening wedge, showcasing a massive rising channel pattern at play. However, the higher-high formation in the bullish channel fails to surpass the critical resistance at $3,750, resulting in a bearish turnaround with a dome-shaped reversal. Tradingview The ETH price is now back at $3,615. The intraday pullback comes with a higher price action from the R1 pivot resistance level at $3,759. Currently, the Ethereum price is making its fifth consecutive bearish candle in the 4-hour chart and inching closer to the nearest pivot support at $3,570. The bearish turnaround has broken under the 20-EMA in the 4-hour chart. Further, it has recorded an intraday pullback of 2.54%, the new negative cycle within the rising channel pattern.

37134469,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315009,1733141032,"Crypto Spot Trading Volume Surges to $2.71 Trillion in November, Doubling October’s Numbers","November saw a resurgence in cryptocurrency trading, with monthly spot trading volumes soaring to $2.71 trillion—the highest level since May 2021. The figure represents a more than twofold increase from October’s $1.14 trillion, according to data from The Block . Per the data, Binance dominated the market, processing $986 billion and accounting for 36% of the total volume. Crypto Spot Trading on Major Exchanges Performs Well in November Other major exchanges, including Crypto.com, Upbit, and Bybit, also reported impressive performances, each exceeding $200 billion in monthly trading volume. The rally extended to futures markets as well, with Bitcoin futures reaching $2.59 trillion in total trading volume and Ethereum futures hitting $1.28 trillion—both marking their highest levels in over two years. The surge was largely driven by the reelection of pro-crypto Republican Donald Trump as U.S. President on November 6. This political development spurred a price rally, with Bitcoin breaking its all-time high to reach $99,635 and Solana hitting a new peak later in the month. The GMCI 30, an index tracking the top 30 cryptocurrencies, rose by 62.3% in November. JUST IN: Global #crypto spot trade volume hit $2.7T in November, the highest since May 2021. pic.twitter.com/lBc8OMOdGq — Breaking Whale (@BreakingWhale) December 2, 2024 Adding to the momentum was the resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, whose departure was welcomed by many in the crypto industry as a potential shift toward less aggressive regulation. Furthermore, November was a historic month for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, with investors pouring $6.4 billion into spot BTC ETFs. The surge in inflows coincided with a month-long rally that saw Bitcoin’s price soar by 45%, reaching an all-time high of $99,000. BlackRock’s Bitcoin Fund Dominates Inflows in November Data from Farside Investors revealed that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF dominated the inflows, accounting for $5.6 billion—or nearly 87%—of the total. Other major contributors included Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, which attracted $962 million, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF with $211.5 million, and the VanEck Bitcoin ETF at $71.2 million. The bullish momentum was driven by strong market sentiment, with Bitcoin’s price climbing from $68,000 at the start of November to its record-breaking peak. Analysts believe the consistent inflow of funds from both institutional and retail investors will sustain the ongoing rally as Bitcoin enters a critical price discovery phase. Despite the inflows, some ETFs recorded significant outflows, totaling $411 million. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF led the losses, with $364 million in outflows, followed by Bitwise Bitcoin ETF at $40.4 million and Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund at $6.8 million. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which gauges investor sentiment, hit a yearly high of 92 on November 22, reflecting strong confidence among market participants. Although the index dipped slightly in December, sentiment remained highly positive. As reported, Grayscale Investments has seen its cryptocurrency holdings skyrocket in November, driven by surging altcoins like Stellar (XLM) and XRP. Data from Cryptorank reveals an 85% surge in the market capitalization of Grayscale’s crypto portfolio over the past month.

37131853,https://coinpedia.org/?p=387995,1733140883,JTO Price Analysis: Will $3.18 Support Hold Amid Bearish Signals?,"The post JTO Price Analysis: Will $3.18 Support Hold Amid Bearish Signals? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the bullish trend in the broader market continues, the Solana-based altcoin, Jito, faces a sharp pullback. As the JTO price drops under the $3.50 crucial milestone, the buyers are under panic. Will a double top reversal result in a pullback to the $2.68 support level? Let’s find out in our latest JITO price analysis. JTO Price Analysis In the daily chart, the JTO price trend continues a bullish rally of higher high formation. However, the intraday drop of 7.87% has warned of a sharp pullback. Tradingview Currently, the JTO price is trading at the psychological mark of $3.50, with the bearish engulfing candle crossing under the 50% Fibonacci level. The bearish engulfing candle undermines the bullish recovery over the last four days and warns of a bearish extension. The immediate support for the JTO price is $3.18, the 38.20% Fibonacci level. The trendline breakout rally continues to form higher highs. However, the pullbacks have been intense, with the previous one dropping from $3.18 to $2.68 in the second week of November. Furthermore, the current rejection from the $3.80 warns of a double top reversal. The neckline for the bearish pattern is at $3.45. Hence, a closing below this level will increase pressure over the $3.18 support level. Technical Indicators MACD: Supporting the chances of a bearish turnaround, the MACD and signal lines are merged and warn of a negative crossover. EMA: The dynamic average support lines of the 20, 50, and 100-day EMA are rising higher. The immediate dynamic support is provided by the 20-day EMA at $3.35. However, the significant support remains at the 50D EMA at $2.93. Will JTO Price Cross $3.18? In case of a bullish turnaround from the crucial dynamic average lines, the Fibonacci level swains the price target at the $4 psychological mark. However, the massive supply at $3.80 must be surpassed before the JTO price continues the higher high trend. Considering the broader market recovery, the JTO price could reach the $5.33 mark by the end of December if the support at $3.18 persists. In case of a bearish breakdown, the JTO price could retest the 100-day EMA at $2.70. As Solana crosses $200, how high will the SOL price go in 2024?

37131865,https://crypto.news/?p=14314944,1733140860,Crypto traders choose to spend rather than HODL | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. HODL has been the time-honored philosophy of Bitcoin ( BTC ) holders. Rather than spending their growing wealth, those who own the biggest cryptocurrency have chosen to ‘hold on for dear life’ with an evangelistic zeal. Nevertheless, while Bitcoin, the king of crypto, continues to capture the headlines, the cryptocurrency space is in a very different place now from where it was just a few years ago. You might also like: The transformative potential of Bitcoin in the job market | Opinion Dogecoin ( DOGE ) may have been launched in 2013, but it is currently in the cycle of an explosion of interest in memecoins. While this market has unfortunately been prey to scams and pump-and-dump schemes, the growth and increasing significance of meme coins is an undeniable fact. Meanwhile, the architecture and payment rails of the space have also changed dramatically. In the past, Bitcoin holders who chose to sell their holdings and off-ramp rather than HODL often had to rely upon shady intermediaries, exorbitant fees, and snail-paced processing times. Now, holders of cryptocurrency have a variety of options for off-ramping, with payment specialists in the web3 space forming partnerships with giants from the TradFi space, such as Mastercard. Off-ramping from digital tokens into a fiat currency can now be done in a seamless and secure way with low fees and charges. Meme coin frenzy In the current bull market cycle, which has seen Bitcoin pierce a new all-time high above $97,000, the market capitalization of meme coins has skyrocketed from $56 billion to $118 billion following Trump’s re-election and a subsequent crypto bull run. Originally created as a joke based on the ‘Doge’ meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog, DOGE is the biggest and most recognisable meme coin. Many meme coins are also named after endearing animals, one example being Moo Deng ( MOODENG ), the baby pygmy hippopotamus living in a Thai zoo. Elon Musk’s appointment to President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet as head of the new Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE, has fueled DOGE’s ascent, with the digital token now having a market capitalization of $58 billion. We’re now witnessing tens of thousands of meme coins attempting to emulate DOGE’s success being created each day on Pump.Fun, a Solana-based tool that removes technical barriers to developing the tokens. Crypto traders are FOMing into newly launched meme coins, often for just a few dollars, in the hope that the token will capture a cult-like following and soar in value. Non-custodial wallet Phantom, which provides users with an array of opportunities to bet on meme coins, has been propelled to the second spot on the charts in the utility section of the Apple App Store in the US. Those who make winning bets on meme coins often swap the tokens into established cryptocurrencies such as Solana to lock in profits and as a bridge before converting their holdings into a fiat currency. End of creaky payment rails The cryptocurrency space has evolved to a point where it is almost unrecognizable from where it was a decade ago. Notably, Mastercard and Visa have now entered the web3 ecosystem. Mercuryo’s Mastercard crypto debit card, Spend, bridges the gap between non-custodial crypto wallets and traditional payment methods. Spend is a plug-and-play solution that can be quickly integrated into a non-custodial wallet and rolled out to users who can add it to their Apple Pay or Google Play wallet. Spend is available to use online and in-store across Mastercard’s 100 million-plus network of merchants, providing users with a seamless, low-cost means of off-ramping their crypto holdings. Holders of the Spend card benefit from a level of consumer protection on a par with a traditional debit or credit card. The cryptocurrency space is continually evolving. The growing significance of meme coins has partly been driven by Generation Z’s dominance of social media channels such as Instagram, TikTok, and X. These social channels provide a public forum for newly launched meme coins to go viral and obtain a cult-like following. At the same time, we are witnessing the emergence of new payment products that provide crypto traders with an accessible and low-cost means of spending their trading profits. While the philosophy of HODL still resonates strongly with Bitcoin evangelists, newcomers to the web3 space arguably have more of a ‘live-for-today’ philosophy. Driven by a belief that life is short and crypto profits should be spent, these consumers are taking advantage of payment products that facilitate the off-ramping of cryptocurrency at a low cost. While it is pure speculation to guess how long the current crypto bull market will go on, what’s certain is that the market is continuing to evolve at a breakneck pace. This is reflected in a somewhat comedic fashion with the meme coin mania that we’ve been witnessing but also in the increasing sophistication of payment products in the space. These off-ramping services have levels of compliance and protection that are on par with payment products from traditional finance and enable people to spend their newfound crypto wealth in the real world.

The protocol clarified in a December 1 statement on X that contrary to earlier claims by third parties, the exploit was not due to a private key leak but rather a design flaw within its withdrawal process. Hack Targets Two Liquidity Pools The breach, which occurred on December 1, impacted two of Clipper’s liquidity pools, amounting to 6% of the exchange’s total value locked (TVL). Clipper assured users that no other pools were affected and that the exploit has been resolved. “There have been third-party claims suggesting a private key leak,” Clipper stated. “We can confirm that this is not the case and is inconsistent with the design and security architecture of Clipper.” The vulnerability was linked to the ability to withdraw funds in the form of a single token, described as a “bundled swap + deposit/withdrawal transaction.” This feature has since been disabled as a precautionary measure. The incident came to light after Chaofan Shou, co-founder of the security firm Fuzzland, suggested on X that the hack could have resulted from an API vulnerability, enabling attackers to sign deposit and withdrawal requests fraudulently. Clipper dismissed these claims but acknowledged the need for a thorough investigation. Protocol Takes Action Amid Rising Crypto Thefts In the wake of the hack, Clipper has paused swaps and deposits while keeping withdrawals open, albeit with stricter conditions. Users can only withdraw funds in a mix of assets from the affected pools. The protocol is actively tracing the stolen funds and has extended an olive branch to the attacker, inviting them to initiate communication for potential negotiations. This breach adds to the troubling tally of over $1.48 billion in crypto stolen globally in 2024 , according to a recent Immunefi report. While this figure marks a 15% decline compared to the same period last year, it underscores the persistent vulnerabilities plaguing the DeFi sector. Shipyard Software Inc., the creator of Clipper, has yet to issue further statements regarding the incident. For Clipper and its users, the hack serves as a stark reminder of the importance of robust security protocols in safeguarding decentralized platforms.

37131827,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373001,1733140793,Michael Saylor Proposes Bitcoin Strategy to Microsoft,"MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor has made a pitch to Microsoft’s board of directors, proposing that the tech giant fully embrace Bitcoin. In a three-minute presentation, Saylor outlined how Bitcoin could transform Microsoft’s financial strategy, potentially adding nearly $5 trillion to its market capitalization. Financial Growth and Enhanced Shareholder Returns “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next technology wave, and Bitcoin is that wave,” Saylor declared. He described Bitcoin as the greatest digital transformation of the 21st century, labeling it a “digital capital” that is economically and technically superior to physical money. Saylor emphasized that the Redmond-based software maker should embrace digital capital, arguing that investing in Bitcoin offers greater advantages than stock buybacks or holding bonds. Highlighting Bitcoin’s potential, MicroStrategy’s Executive Chair projected it would grow to represent $280 trillion of global wealth within 20 years, surpassing gold and art. He pointed out that Microsoft’s adoption of the cryptocurrency would offer significant advantages. Saylor urged the company to convert its cash flows, dividend payouts, stock buybacks, and debt into BTC, stating this move could add hundreds of dollars to its stock price and create trillions in enterprise value. Specifically, he predicted that Bitcoin could increase Microsoft’s stock price by up to $584 per share over the next decade, assuming its value reaches $1.7 million by 2034. Currently valued at $3.18 trillion, Microsoft is the third most valuable firm globally. Saylor predicted that adopting Bitcoin could elevate its market cap by an additional $4.9 trillion. He framed the decision as a choice between clinging to outdated financial strategies or using Bitcoin to drive accelerated growth. “It’s time for Microsoft to evaluate its BTC strategic options,” he said in closing. “Do the right thing for the world and adopt Bitcoin.” Saylor Says He Can Convince Buffett to Buy Bitcoin Microsoft’s board of directors isn’t the only one Saylor is targeting as he continues his Bitcoin evangelism. In a recent appearance on the PBD Podcast, the BTC bull expressed confidence in his ability to convince Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett to embrace the cryptocurrency. “I’d be willing to bet you that if I had an hour alone with Buffett in a calm environment, I’d walk out, and he would say this Bitcoin thing is a pretty good idea,” he stated. Highlighting what he described as inefficiencies in Berkshire’s $325 billion cash reserve, Saylor argued that the funds generate just a 3% after-tax yield while facing a 15% cost of capital. He claimed this results in a 12% negative real yield and an annual shareholder value erosion of $32 billion. The 59-year-old has consistently promoted Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, urging companies with substantial cash reserves to integrate it into their financial strategies. This approach has gained popularity among several organizations, including Metaplanet, with 1,142 BTC , and Semler Scientific, which recently invested $29 million in BTC. Online video platform Rumble also recently announced a $20 million investment in the coin. However, MicroStrategy remains the largest publicly traded Bitcoin holder, with nearly 387,000 BTC reserves.

Attacks on Major Centralized Exchanges The recent attack on Clipper comes amid a trend of increasing attacks on centralized exchanges in 2024. Some major incidents this year include the $235 million breach of India’s WazirX exchange in July, a $52 million hack on Singapore’s BingX in September, and a $55 million exploit of Turkey’s BtcTurk in June. More recently, XT.com, a Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange, paused withdrawals following reports of a suspected $1.7 million hack . Last week, U.S. federal prosecutors charged five individuals in connection with a sophisticated hacking operation that allegedly stole $11 million in crypto and sensitive data from individuals and companies across multiple countries. According to court filings, the alleged hackers targeted at least 29 individuals, with one victim losing over $6.3 million in cryptocurrency after their email and digital wallets were compromised. Prosecutors claim the group also targeted 45 companies in the U.S., Canada, India, and the United Kingdom. Among their targets was a U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange whose employees were tricked by fake text messages into divulging sensitive credentials.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

37131724,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373039,1733140586,Top Ripple Price Predictions After XRP’s Run to $2.5,"TL:DR; XRP continues to steal the show as it skyrocketed to $2.5 earlier today, thus coming less than $1 away from its all-time high of $3.4. The ever-vigilant Ripple community was quick to outline new peaks for the asset, with some slightly ridiculous predictions of up to $20. Will XRP See New All-Time High Soon? The cryptocurrency market has been on fire ever since Donald J. Trump won the ’24 US presidential elections nearly a month ago. The charge was initially led by Bitcoin, which broke its March all-time high of $73,737 and skyrocketed to just shy of $100,000 for its latest peak. Numerous altcoins followed suit with immediate gains, such as Dogecoin, while others, like XRP, trailed behind at first but joined the party later and exceeded most expectations. Ripple’s token has been at the forefront of gains in the past month, having surged by 350% and tapping $2.5 earlier today for the first time since January 2018. Moreover, it surpassed several crypto assets on its way up in terms of market cap and even entered the top three briefly today. The XRP army, one of the most popular crypto communities, celebrated the move, and many posted their predictions about the asset’s future behavior. According to Xena XRP, the $3 level remains the biggest obstacle now in the token’s path toward a new all-time high of $3.4. If it breaks, then comes “price discovery… levels XRP has never been before.” JayXRP forecasted that the token will surge to $3.19 this week, while business consultant and market observer Jacob Canfield said XRP could rise up to $6.6, which is the “ideal FOMO target.” However, he believes there will be a pull back soon before the asset heads north again. The only difference between this $XRP move and those in the past is the price of Bitcoin is 5X higher than it was in 2017. If we use Canfield Fibonacci extensions to give us an idea of where this move may take us, it would be at the 11.09 fib exension.

At the same time, he blasted the quite ridiculous predictions of up to $10,000. My $XRP price target for this cycle $5-$8. It could go a bit higher but I’m gonna play it safe and be conservative.

Kiyosaki, who is famous for his bold comments about financial markets, the US government and the FED, stated that Bitcoin could experience a sharp decline in the short term. Despite concerns about a possible price drop to $60,000, Kiyosaki continues to hold Bitcoin as part of his portfolio. The famous name showed his belief in the long-term potential of Bitcoin by stating that if his prediction comes true and BTC drops to $60,000, he will not sell his BTCs and will even see this drop as an opportunity to buy more Bitcoin. “Bitcoin is crashing: Bitcoin remains below $100,000. This means that BTC could drop to $60,000. “If and when I won't sell. BTC will sell. I'll buy more.” Kiyosaki stated that the rise in Bitcoin has just begun and thinks that Bitcoin is likely to reach $250,000 in 2025. While this estimate would be 2.5 times the current BTC price, Kiyosaki stated that Bitcoin could fall to $60,000 before reaching $250,000. *This is not investment advice.

Users must do their own research before taking any actions related to the company. Cardano’s bullish surge and Rollblock’s explosive presale gains spark investor optimism, with both tokens poised for significant growth in the crypto market. Table of Contents Rollblock branches into iGaming market, increasing profit margin Cardano rockets following recent network developments Conclusion Cardano (ADA) and Rollblock (RBLK) have sparked optimism among investors. With increased trading volume and growing market confidence, ADA’s recent performance has analysts speculating whether this could mark the beginning of a broader bull run. On the other hand, Rollblock is nearing the end of its public presale. With over $6.5 million generated and projections of 800% post-launch, could this rally signal a turning point for RBLK or ADA in the crypto market? Find the details below. Rollblock branches into iGaming market, increasing profit margin Rollblock takes online gambling to a whole new level by fusing it with blockchain technology and a reward-based ecosystem. The games, exclusive events, and financial compensations in return are powered by the RBLK token. By embedding DeFi features into the platform, Rollblock provides a unique opportunity through which both players and investors can benefit from its growth. The most outstanding feature of Rollblock is its revenue-sharing model. Token holders are rewarded for staking their RBLK by sharing in the revenues from the platform on a week-to-week basis. That creates long-term involvement, and the user earns passive income when the platform does well. Additionally, Rollblock provides staking bonuses and cashback rewards, enhancing the player experience and incentivizing continued engagement. Regarding long-term value, Rollblock provides a deflationary mechanism that accommodates token buybacks and burns. Using these strategies reduces the circulating supply of RBLK, which creates scarcity and increases in value over time. With a focus on security, transparency, and user rewards, Rollblock maintains an edge over the rising iGaming scene. A perfect mix of the best elements of gaming and decentralized finance, Rollblock provides a platform where players and investors can thrive together. Cardano rockets following recent network developments ADA has been on a bull run, with a price climb exceeding 200% in the past month. As of November 30, the coin is approaching important resistance levels, notably $1.15 and $1.22. This bullish momentum is supported by a favorable technical outlook, including ADA trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The market sentiment surrounding Cardano has been strengthened by the ZK smart contract on Halo 2, the upcoming Hydra scaling upgrade, and its expansion into decentralized finance. Additionally, the recent 54% spike in trading volume indicates growing investor demand and the price has shown resilience with solid support levels of around $1. With 22 green days in the last 30, some analysts project a 140% surge in the coming months. Sentiments on the ADA network are largely positive following a 119% increase in daily active addresses. If ADA can break through its key resistance levels, it could push the price toward $1.30 by the end of 2024. Conclusion While Cardano predictions indicate a potential increase of around 110% in the coming months, Rollblock’s projections exceed an impressive 750% for the same period. During the Rollblock presale, each RBLK token is priced at $0.037. Investors are currently participating in the eighth stage, where early holders can benefit from attractive tiered bonuses based on their RBLK holdings.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen notable weekly outflows that have stalled momentum towards the $100,000 milestone. The drop over the weekend partially reversed an increase of almost 2% from Friday. However, BTC’s close above $95,000 indicates positive demand demand. While major issuers reported inflows, spot Bitcoin ETFs ended a seven-week inflow streak with net outflows of $153 million for the week ending November 29. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) has registered an incredible surge of over 31% in the past 24 hours, flipping Solana (SOL) and Tether (USDT) to become the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency. The unprecedented surge is driven by legal clarity and regulatory optimism, which has sparked renewed optimism among XRP investors. The altcoin is up almost 67% over the past week. The crypto market cap reported an increase of 1.45% and currently sits at $3.45 trillion. Ripple (XRP) Flips Solana (SOL) and Tether (USDT) to Become Third Largest Cryptocurrency Ripple's (XRP) incredible surge has seen it flip SOL and USDT to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. As of writing, XRP’s market capitalization is $139 billion, putting it far ahead of SOL and USDT. The increase sees XRP reclaim a spot it had lost after being sued by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, which alleged XRP was a security. The lawsuit led to significant hesitation and turmoil among investors as XRP got delisted from major exchanges. The sharp decline in XRP’s value saw the altcoin slump to seventh in market capitalization. However, a breakthrough in 2023 ended some regulatory uncertainty and determined that XRP was not a security in some aspects, sparking a rally and boosting XRP’s market capitalization. The latest jump is partially due to Donald Trump’s re-election and SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s impending resignation. Investors anticipate a favorable regulatory environment under the incoming administration. Speculation is rife that Trump could appoint a crypto-friendly SEC Chair following Gensler’s departure. Despite its surge, XRP is still considerably lower than its all-time high of $3.40, achieved in January 2018. Russia Approves Crypto Tax The Russian Government has approved a federal bill for new taxes on crypto transactions. Russia's upper house approved the bill on November 27, imposing between 13% and 15% tax on crypto sales. While mining activities have been made exempt from value-added tax (VAT), mining operators must report necessary details about crypto mining services to local authorities or pay a fine of 40,000 rubles. DMM Bitcoin Preparing To Liquidate Japanese cryptocurrency exchange DMM Bitcoin is preparing to liquidate after losing $320 million in a private key hack. The exchange is struggling to recover from the loss and is reportedly ceasing efforts to restart operations. Customer assets will be transferred to SBI VC Trade, an exchange operator under the SBI Group. The exchange was compromised in May after falling victim to a server breach and private key hack, which the company called an “unauthorized leak.” The hack led to the loss of over 4,500 BTC from a single wallet. At the time, DMM Bitcoin stated all user deposits would be fully guaranteed as it halted withdrawals, trading, and new account openings. To compensate all users the platform promised to procure the equivalent amount of BTC. The DMM hack was the second largest after the Coincheck hack in 2018, during which hackers stole a staggering $530 million. Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Major BTC Correction The author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad” has predicted Bitcoin (BTC) could crash to a low of $60,000 as it struggles to surpass $100,000. The best-selling author shared his perspective in a post on X, stating that any downturn would be an opportunity to buy rather than a cause for concern. “BITCOIN to CRASH Bitcoin is stalled short of $100k. That means BTC may crash to $60k. If and when that happens I will not sell. BTC will be having a sale. I will buy more. I predict Bitcoin will settle around $250 in 2025. At this stage of the BTC process… price is not as important..as how much BTC you acquire. I want more BTC. Take care.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) continues to hover around the $95,000-$96,000 mark as it struggles to build momentum and go above $100,000. Outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs have stalled progress towards $100,000, with BTC facing a slight pullback over the weekend. However, despite the decline on Saturday, BTC remained above $95,000, which analysts believe is a sign of positive interest from investors. BTC’s price chart shows subdued movements since November 22, when the price peaked above $99,600. However, it has struggled since and has been unable to move towards the $100,000 mark. BTC registered a substantial decline last Sunday, slipping below $95,000 to a low of $94,838 before buyers propped up the price to $97,891. However, it was back in the red on Monday, registering a substantial decline of 5.16% to go below $95,000 and settle at $92,845. Buyers attempted a recovery on Tuesday but were thwarted, as sellers dragged BTC to a low of $90,707. However, BTC recovered to climb above $91,000 and settled at $91,913 after a decline of 1%. Source: TradingView With the 20-day SMA acting as a dynamic level of support, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising by 4.32% and settling above $95,000 at $95,883. Buyers and sellers struggled to take control on Thursday. Ultimately, neither assumed control as BTC registered a marginal drop. Buying activity increased on Friday as BTC rose by 1.76% to $97,374. However, it was back in the red on Saturday as the cryptocurrency suffered a slight pullback, dropping by 1.14% to $96,263. However, it recovered on Sunday, registering a marginal increase of 0.79%, and settled at $97,026. The current session sees BTC back in the red, with the price down just over 1% and trading at $95,955. So where does BTC go from here? The cryptocurrency is clearly struggling to go above the $100,000 level. Some analysts have predicted a correction that could take BTC to a low of $80,000 before it resumes its upward momentum. Best-selling author Robert Kiyosaki has predicted it could go as low as $60,000 but argued that a substantial decline should be viewed as a buying opportunity, keeping in mind the eventual rebound. Analysts are bullish about BTC’s long-term prospects, predicting it will cross $100,000 before the end of the year. Kiyosaki is even more bullish and predicts BTC will hit $250,000 in 2025. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) registered a marginal decline over the past 24 hours as it struggles to go above $3,700. Despite recent struggles, ETH is up almost 50% over the past month following Donald Trump’s election victory. ETH faced considerable volatility last weekend as buyers and sellers struggled to exert influence. Thanks to the volatility, ETH ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping just over 1% and settling at $3,362. Buyers returned to the market on Monday as ETH rose to an intraday high of $3,547. However, buyers could not stay above $3,500, and the price fell to settle at $3,415, an increase of 1.60%. Despite the strong start to the week, ETH fell back on Tuesday, dropping almost 3% to settle at $3,325. Source: TradingView ETH posted a significant increase of almost 10% on Wednesday, surging past $3,500 and settling at $3,657. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level, and ETH registered a drop of just over 2% and settled at $3,580. Friday saw buyers and sellers struggle to exert influence, and ETH ultimately settled at $3,594 after a marginal increase. ETH was bullish over the weekend, rising by 3.08% on Saturday to go above $3,700 and settle at $3,708. However, with strong resistance at this level, momentum waned on Sunday, and ETH registered only a marginal increase to settle at $3,710. The current session sees ETH back in the red as it dipped below $3,700. ETH is currently trading at $3,664, down by 1.25%. If sellers retain control and drive ETH lower, it could slip below $3,500. A drop below this level could see ETH decline to $3,000. However, if buyers can retake control and break above $3,700, ETH could surge to $4,000. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL)’s decline has intensified as it slipped below the 20-day SMA, with sellers firmly in control. SOL reached a high of $264 last weekend, but sellers have taken control since, with the price declining substantially. SOL started the previous week with a drop of over 7% to go below $250 and settle at $234. The price encountered substantial volatility on Tuesday as buyers attempted to drive it below the 20-day SMA. As a result, SOL fell to an intraday low of $222 before recovering and settling at $230. The price made a strong recovery on Wednesday, bouncing off the 20-day SMA to register an increase of 4.99% and settle at $242. Source: TradingView However, it was back in the red on Thursday, dropping almost 2% after facing substantial volatility and settling at $237. SOL recovered on Friday as buyers returned to the market, registering an increase of 2.41% to go above $240 and settle at $243. However, it was back in the red over the weekend, registering a drop of 2.33% on Saturday and settling at $237. Sellers remained in control on Sunday as SOL registered a marginal decline to end the weekend negatively. Selling pressure has intensified considerably during the ongoing session, with SOL down almost 6%, slipping below the 20-day SMA to trade at $223. Algorand (ALGO) Price Analysis Algorand (ALGO) has registered a stunning increase over the weekend, capturing investor interest. ALGO recently broke out of a prolonged sideways trend, with analysts expecting a strong rally, which has seemingly arrived. With the absence of any significant resistance, ALGO could surge towards $0.60 before sellers step in. ALGO’s breakout occurred following the US elections as the markets celebrated the result. While it registered a decline last weekend and started the previous week on a negative note, it was back in positive territory on Tuesday, surging by 14.49% to $0.297. The price fell back on Wednesday, registering a marginal decline before resuming its upward trajectory on Thursday, rising over 10% to $0.323. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment intensified substantially on Friday, surging an unprecedented 37% and settling at $0.441. The weekend began with considerable volatility on Saturday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. ALGO ultimately registered a marginal increase and settled at $0.443. Bullish sentiment returned on Sunday as ALGO rose almost 10% to $0.496 despite facing significant volatility. However, the price is back in the red during the ongoing session as sellers prevent a move above $0.50. Dogwifhat (WIF) Price Analysis Dogwifhat (WIF) has declined substantially during the ongoing session after making an impressive recovery over the weekend. WIF started the previous week on a very volatile note as it surged to an intraday high of $3.65 before falling back to $3.17. Sellers took control on Tuesday as WIF fell below the 20-day SMA after a drop of almost 5% and settled at $3.02. However, WIF recovered on Wednesday thanks to strong support at this level, rising just over 3% and settling at $3.11. However, it was back in the red on Thursday, falling by 1.25% to $3.07. Source: TradingView Buyers returned to the market on Friday as WIF rallied almost 7%. However, it could not move past the 20-day SMA and settled at $3.28. With the 20-day SMA acting as resistance, WIF fell back on Saturday, dropping by 3.25% to $3.18. Sellers attempted to drive WIF below $3 on Sunday as it fell to a low of $3.05. However, it recovered from this level to rally by 8.05%, going above the 20-day SMA and settling at $3.43. WIF is back in the red during the current session, having slipped below the 20-day SMA with the price down over 10% as sellers look to push it below $3. Tron (TRX) Price Analysis Tron (TRX) fell to an intraday low of $0.185 on Tuesday as it started the previous week on a bearish note, with sellers dominating the market. However, it recovered from this level to climb above $0.190 and settle at $0.195. TRX recovered on Wednesday, registering an increase of almost 3% to settle at $0.200. Sellers attempted to lower the price on Thursday but were unsuccessful as TRX rose by 1.62% to move to $0.203. Friday saw a significant uptick in volatility as buyers and sellers attempted to exert control. Ultimately, neither could gain the upper hand and TRX remained at $0.203. Source: TradingView Buyers returned to the market over the weekend as TRX registered an increase of 0.81% on Saturday and 0.85% on Sunday to settle at $0.207. The current session sees TRX marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to assume control. Bittensor (TAO) Price Analysis Bittensor (TAO) registered a substantial increase last week, but its momentum has stalled over the past couple of sessions as sellers drove the price below $600. TAO started the previous week on a positive note, rising by 3.35% to go above the 50-day SMA and settle at $546. It faced considerable selling pressure on Tuesday as the price fell to an intraday low of $503. However, TAO recovered from this level to register an increase of almost 3% and settle at $560. TAO surged to an intraday high of $721 on Wednesday but quickly fell below $600 to settle at $561, registering only a marginal increase. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment returned on Thursday as TAO rose by 6.05% and settled at $595. An increase of 3.79% on Friday took TAO above $600 as it settled at $618. Buyers retained control on Saturday as TAO rose almost 10% to $678. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level as a move to $700 failed to materialize. As a result, TAO fell over 6% on Sunday and dropped to $636. The current session sees TAO down almost 6% as sellers look to drive it below $600.

37131119,https://finbold.com/?p=216268,1733139451,"If you invested $1,000 in XRP when SEC sued Ripple, you’d have this much now","Despite it being one of the most prominent and recognizable cryptocurrencies in the world, the price of XRP has been depressed for years and even missed the majority of the 2024 bull market due to the 2020 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple Labs and the subsequent legal battle. Despite the courtroom fight not being quite finished – it will enter its next and possibly final chapter in January 2025 – XRP has recently exploded in value on a string of positive news. Specifically, Donald Trump’s re-election – and the anticipated pro-cryptocurrency pivot expected from it – and the news that SEC Chair Gary Gensler will resign on January 20 served to ignite the built-up optimism from Ripple’s courtroom wins. Overall, the setup ensured that XRP is 351.69% in the green over the last 30 days, with a press time price of $2.33. XRP 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold Here’s how much a 2020 XRP investment would have returned Considering the SEC lawsuit served as the starting point of the dominant strand of the XRP saga – and that the sage now appears poised for an epilogue – Finbold decided how much would have an investment made in late 2020, either as a show of support for Ripple or taking advantage of the ‘buy the dip’ moment, be worth today, on December 2, 2024. On December 22, 2020 – the day the SEC announced its case against Ripple Labs, Brad Garlinghouse, and Christian Larsen – XRP stood at $0.4484. Just one day later, the value of the token plunged to $0.2586. This means a $1,000 investment made when the SEC unveiled its lawsuit would have initially lost nearly half its value in a day. However, by Monday, December 2, 2024, it would have grown by an impressive 123.02%, reaching $2,230.15 – a profit of $1,230.15. An investment made one day after the watchdog’s announcement – as a show of confidence in Ripple, taking advantage of the ‘buy the dip’ opportunity, or for an entirely different reason – would have been even more lucrative. Specifically, $1,000 invested on December 23, 2020, would have grown 286.7% by press time to a total value of $3,866.98 – a $2,866.98 profit. Will XRP continue surging into 2025 Looking ahead, XPR’s future appears as bright as its last 30 days. Numerous analysts have taken their turns analyzing the token and trying to gauge its likely pathway to high targets such as $6 . Furthermore, a new all-time high (ATH) for XRP in 2025 appears highly likely , particularly as significant whale activity in recent weeks has bolstered ever-higher support zones. Still, it is worth remembering that January could bring another twist in the Ripple-SEC legal battle – one with a non-zero chance of being adverse for the cryptocurrency – and the very nature of the market means that there are no guarantees XRP’s upcoming performance will mimic the current trends.

37131167,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620847,1733139180,New Blockchain Token Could Challenge Ethereum’s Dominance in AI Applications,"Ethereum has long been the go-to platform for decentralized applications, offering a robust infrastructure for smart contracts and blockchain-based innovations. However, a new blockchain token, Lightchain AI , is emerging as a serious challenger to Ethereum’s dominance—specifically in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) applications. With its revolutionary approach to integrating AI into blockchain ecosystems, Lightchain AI is capturing the attention of analysts and investors as the next big thing in decentralized technology. What Makes Lightchain AI a Serious Contender? Unlike Ethereum, which focuses on generalized blockchain applications, Lightchain AI has carved out a niche by seamlessly merging blockchain and AI. This focus gives it a significant edge in targeting industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics, where AI integration can deliver transformative results.

Hong Kong-based Boyaa Interactive recently shifted a large portion of its Ethereum holdings into Bitcoin. On the other hand, Japan's DMM Bitcoin exchange is shutting down after a devastating hack earlier this year. Meanwhile, analysts predict a bullish December for Bitcoin, though some still warn about possible corrections ahead. Michael Saylor Sees Bitcoin as Microsoft’s Key to Future Dominance Michael Saylor, chair of MicroStrategy and a well known advocate for Bitcoin (BTC), recently delivered a bold pitch to Microsoft’s board of directors. During this pitch, Saylor suggested that the tech giant could greatly boost its market capitalization by embracing Bitcoin. Michael Saylors MSFT market cap estimates (Source: Michael Saylor ) In a presentation that was shared via video on Dec. 1, Saylor proposed that Microsoft could add almost $5 trillion to its value by converting its cash flows, dividends, stock buybacks, and debt into Bitcoin. The three-minute presentation was accompanied by a 44-slide deck, and mainly centered around Bitcoin as the cornerstone of Microsoft's future strategy. Saylor argued that Bitcoin represents the next transformative wave in technology, and warned that missing it could leave Microsoft at a disadvantage. According to his projections, Bitcoin could add up to $584 to Microsoft’s share price over the next decade, assuming the crypto’s value reaches $1.7 million per BTC by 2034. This aggressive strategy will generate immense enterprise value while reducing risk for shareholders. Michael Saylor’s MSFT share price estimations (Source: Michael Saylor ) Microsoft is the third most valuable company globally, with its valuation of $3.18 trillion. Saylor suggested that an annual investment of $100 billion into Bitcoin will be a much more lucrative alternative to stock buybacks or holding bonds. He also mentioned the growing public and political support for Bitcoin, and referred to some pro-crypto statements from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and recent Bitcoin-related products introduced by major Wall Street firms. He believes this is evidence of a “crypto renaissance.” MicroStrategy’s own experience with Bitcoin has been quite successful. Since 2020, the company bought 386,700 BTC for $21.9 billion, which is an investment that is now worth close to $37.6 billion at Bitcoin’s current price. This strategy also propelled MicroStrategy’s stock price , which surged 465.5% in 2024 to reach a record high of $421.88 in November. Saylor finished his pitch by urging Microsoft to seize the opportunity. He also framed Bitcoin not only as an investment, but as a transformative strategic asset. He even challenged the board to “do the right thing for the world and adopt Bitcoin.” Hong Kong’s Boyaa Shifts Crypto Strategy to Bitcoin Boyaa Interactive International, a Hong Kong-based gaming company that is known for its online card and board games, reshaped its crypto treasury strategy by converting a big portion of its Ethereum (ETH) holdings into Bitcoin. Between Nov. 19 and 28, the company exchanged 14,200 ETH, which is valued at close to $49 million, for approximately 515 Bitcoin. This move increases Boyaa's Bitcoin reserves to 3,183 BTC, worth an estimated $310.7 million at current market prices. In a statement , the company shared that it is very confident in Bitcoin’s future prospects, and considers this a suitable time to expand its reserves by reallocating from Ethereum to Bitcoin. According to its third-quarter results , Boyaa previously held 2,635 Bitcoin and 15,388 ETH in its treasury. This recent conversion also aligns with the company's initial $100 million crypto allocation strategy that was launched in November of 2023. The strategy earmarked $45 million each for Bitcoin and Ethereum and $10 million for stablecoins like Tether and USD Coin. The shift happened during larger price movements in the crypto market. Over the past two weeks, Bitcoin gained more than 6%. The crypto king is also in the green by more than 36% on its monthly time frame. ETH surged by over 45% over the past month to trade at $3,629 at press time. Despite Ethereum’s stronger short-term performance, Boyaa's board chose to prioritize Bitcoin due to its strategic value for the company’s long-term plans. BTC’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Boyaa’s stock price also saw remarkable growth after rising 874% over the past year to $0.68 (5.26 Hong Kong dollars). However, the company’s share value is still below its all-time high of $1.81. Boyaa joined a growing list of companies increasing their Bitcoin holdings. Other firms like Rumble , Semler Scientific, and Genius Group also added Bitcoin to their balance sheets in November. Japanese Exchange DMM Bitcoin to Liquidate On the other hand, Japanese crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin is set to liquidate after failing to recover from a May hack that resulted in the theft of about $320 million in Bitcoin. The company announced plans to transfer customer assets to SBI VC Trade, which is an exchange operator under SBI Group, by March of 2025. This decision was made after a basic agreement between the two firms to facilitate the transfer of all accounts and deposit assets, including both Japanese yen and crypto holdings. The breach happened on May 30, when more than 4,500 Bitcoin were stolen through a private key hack, which the company described as an “unauthorized leak.” At the time, DMM Bitcoin assured its customers that all deposits will be fully guaranteed. The exchange also stopped withdrawals, account openings, and trading, but pledged to procure funds to compensate users. Despite these efforts, the exchange was unable to recover after the second-largest crypto hack in Japan’s history. The stolen funds have been partially laundered. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported in July that around $35 million was funneled to the online marketplace Huione Guarantee. The laundering techniques and indicators suggest that North Korea’s Lazarus Group may have orchestrated the attack. DMM Bitcoin, which was launched in January of 2018 under the ownership of Japanese e-commerce giant DMM Group, faced seven more challenges over the past few months. In November, it discontinued its Seamoon Protocol , a Web3 gaming and anime content initiative, because of rapid changes in the business environment. The firm also shelved plans to issue a stablecoin in partnership with Progmat. The collapse of DMM Bitcoin is part of a broader trend of centralized exchange hacks in 2024. The year saw some major incidents that affected platforms like WazirX in India, BingX in Singapore, and BtcTurk in Turkey, resulting in combined losses of hundreds of millions of dollars. December Bull Run Expected Those companies taking advantage of Bitcoin might reap the rewards of their decision soon. Bitcoin may be entering a price discovery phase that could signal potential ”insane long opportunities” in the months ahead, according to analysts. Daan Crypto Trades , a trader and analyst, said on Dec. 2 that Bitcoin maintained a position above its previous all-time high for nearly a month, which signals the start of its price discovery phase for this cycle. By drawing parallels to past cycles, the analyst pointed out that Bitcoin surged by 1,600% during the 2017 bull market and 245% during the 2021 bull market. Even a modest repeat of half the 2021 gains could push Bitcoin’s price to around $150,000. Price discovery is where an asset’s fair market value is established through buyer and seller interactions, and it usually begins when it trades above previous highs. Charles Edwards , founder of Capriole Fund, believes there is a lot of potential for returns during this phase, especially as each cycle historically delivers 4-7 months of exceptional price discovery gains. He also pointed out that November was the first of these months, with Bitcoin gaining 40% and breaking monthly candle records. December is historically a bullish month for Bitcoin, with average gains of about 10%. Markus Thielen, founder and CEO of 10x Research, pointed out that during halving years, December returns have been particularly strong, averaging 28% across 2012, 2016, and 2020. John Glover , chief investment officer at Ledn, is not as optimistic about the month ahead, and suggested that while momentum could drive Bitcoin toward $125,000, a larger correction is still a possibility. He did reassure traders that a drastic sell-off is unlikely unless Bitcoin breaches the March 2024 high near $74,000.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ASIA | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6332/bitcoin-could-add-5-trillion-to-microsoft-s-value-michael-saylor,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

With a parabolic rally on the words, Litecoin is reaching a crucial resistance breakout, priced at $128. With a bullish start to this week, will the Litecoin price surpass the $200 mark in this recovery run? Let’s find out. Litecoin Price Analysis The LTC price trend is currently at $121.77, with an intraday gain of 1.83%. This marks a bullish opening to the fifth consecutive positive week. In the weekly chart, the rounding bottom reversal in the LTC price trend has surpassed the critical resistance level of $111. Tradingview The supply range extended from $110 to $112, and last week’s closing at $119.61 has given a massive bullish engulfing candle. With the ongoing recovery, the LTC price is now challenging the 23.60% Fibonacci level at $128.16. However, the higher price rejection leading to a long-week candle has dropped the market price. With the 24-hour high at $129.85, the LTC price has now reached the level last seen in April 2022. Furthermore, the sideways trend in the LTC price trend over the past two years is now coming to a bullish conclusion. With the broader market anticipating a breakout of the 23.60% Fibonacci level, the upside price target is expected to be at $218. Will Litecoin Reach $200? Supporting the bullish trend, the MACD and signal line are continuing a positive rally with the surge of gradually intensifying bullish engulfing candles. Furthermore, the 50-week and 200-week EMA lines are incredibly close to giving a golden crossover. This will improve the underlying sentiments and increase the chances of a bullish rally. The higher price rejection warns of a potential retest of the $112 breakout zone, but the broader market recovery will prolong the bullish rally. Before the $218 price target, the LTC price could find minor supply surges at $160 and $187. As Bitcoin targets $100k, are you curious how high Litecoin will go in 2024? Check out Coinpedia’s Litecoin (LTC) price prediction to find price targets above $100. FAQs What is the current price target for LTC? LTC aims for $218, with minor resistance at $160 and $187.

What is Needed for Bitcoin to Exceed $100,000? Analysts Evaluated!","XRP, one of the largest altcoins, has increased by over 20 percent in the last 24 hours, becoming the third largest cryptocurrency in the world by market value. This rapid rise has pushed XRP's market value to over $130 billion, overtaking Tether (USDT) to become the world's third-largest cryptocurrency. Commenting on the rise in XRP, co-founder of crypto exchange Coinstash, Mena Theodorou, said: “XRP’s comeback is driving the market. This potentially signals a return of retail traders and investors to the crypto market. “The recent XRP trends on TikTok, speculations about the approval of a Ripple-issued stablecoin, and the possibility of an ETF are likely adding fuel to the fire and renewing and increasing interest in XRP.” While XRP attracted the attention of the entire market with its tremendous rise, the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) started the new week weakly and fell to the $95,000 levels. Noting that Bitcoin’s upward momentum has consistently stumbled near the elusive six-figure level, BRN analyst Valentin Fournier said: “Amid strong market catalysts and rising investor confidence, Bitcoin continues to struggle with the psychological barrier of $100,000. Bitcoin continues to struggle to reach $100,000 as investors continue to profit from recent gains. A significant sell wall of $384 million must be broken for Bitcoin to continue higher.” Fournier stated that Bitcoin dominance has recently fallen below the positive trend line determined in June 2023, with a 5% decline in the last 12 days, and that with a significant resistance of $ 100,000, the market is shifting capital towards altcoins with the support of increasing liquidity. *This is not investment advice.

37130174,https://finbold.com/?p=216260,1733137499,Cardano (ADA) could crash 20% warns expert,"Altcoin season seems to be in full swing — while Bitcoin ( BTC ) has struggled to breach the $100,000 price point and retreated to $95,546, as of press time, cryptocurrencies with smaller market caps have not faced similar headwinds. In this environment, many traders divert their attention, choosing instead to focus on either altcoins or meme coins. This is a valid strategy — but several of the more established altcoins are showing strong technical signals as we enter into December. Potentially, this could lead to a best-of-both-worlds scenario — netting investors outsized gains without the large degree of volatility often seen with as-of-yet unproven assets. One such cryptocurrency is Cardano ( ADA ). Although it had been on a steady downtrend from March, the beginning of November saw prices go parabolic with the token breaking back into the top 10. At press time, ADA was trading at $1.10 — over the course of the last thirty days, Cardano prices have surged by an impressive 207.07%, bringing year-to-date (YTD) returns up to 84.74%. ADA price monthly and YTD charts. Source: Finbold While impressive, current prices are still quite a ways away from ADA’s all-time high (ATH) of $3.09. However, one technical analyst sees signs of a double-digit correction in the making — which could derail ADA’s impressive bull run. Chart expert foresees that ADA prices could drop to $0.88 There are several indications that Cardano could experience a steep decline to $0.88, equating to a 20% correction, in short order. Most notably, looking at recent price action reveals that ADA has formed a rising wedge pattern beginning on November 22, as detailed by renowned trading expert Ali Martinez in an X post on December 2. ADA rising wedge chart pattern. Source: Ali Martinez on X The rising wedge is a bearish reversal pattern — indicating that a hitherto-present uptrend could change. As seen in the chart, ADA has struggled to break through the upper trend line — per Martinez, if it closes below $1.10, a trend shift will be confirmed — if it drops even further, below $1.03, a bearish breakout to $0.88 will have been confirmed. In addition, he noted that the TD Sequential, an indicator of price reversals, presented a sell signal when looking at a 3-day chart in an earlier X post. ADA price chart with TD Sequential sell signal. Source: Ali Martinez on X This isn’t necessarily a cause for concern — Martinez did not indicate that his long-term views on ADA have shifted — and they are quite bullish. The analyst has previously indicated that Cardano could reach a new all-time high of $6 between July and September of 2025, based on previous cycles. This would represent a 445% rally — and if both of his predictions come to pass, this potential correction could serve as a great entry point. Other market commentators have noted that whales have been quite bullish on ADA — another sign of good long-term prospects.

Let us know! — Uphold (@UpholdInc) December 1, 2024 Community Predictions Uphold’s post prompted a flood of community reactions. Many are optimistic about XRP’s potential to reach new highs. One user confidently forecasted a $5 target for the end of 2024, while another predicted $3.43-$5 by January. Some were more bullish, anticipating even higher gains. One post stated , “$3-$7… hopefully more,” while another suggested XRP could end up between $4 and $5. Will XRP Reach Triple Digits? The most ambitious projection came from a community member who outlined a detailed case for XRP to reach between $37 and $100. The user pointed to various developments and catalysts, starting with the release of the renamed XRP Unleashed documentary. He also pointed to the rise of meme coins on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), and RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin that will soon launch on the XRPL and Ethereum blockchain. Other notable factors are XRP ETFs and ETPs. Multiple companies have applied for XRP ETFs, and the WisdomTree XRP ETP recently launched in Europe. These could bring significant attention to XRP, and boost the digital asset’s adoption and price. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He listed many other factors that could aid XRP’s price growth including potential big-name investors, tokenized money market funds, the rumored meeting between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Donald Trump, global partnerships waiting for the end of the XRP lawsuit, and more. With the current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) planning to step down by January 20, 2025, experts are convinced that the regulator will drop its lawsuit against Ripple once the new administration takes over. Others in the community also share the $100 prediction, with one user stating that the digital asset could reach this target by the end of the year.

Market analyst Satoshi Flipper has made a bold prediction for Ethereum (ETH), one of the best cryptos right now. He predicts that this altcoin could surge to $10,000. The crypto market is also seeing a rise in demand for Shiba Inu (SHIB) and DTX Exchange (DTX) , a new exchange token now in phase five of its presale. Both of these crypto coins have been soaring on the price charts. Since DTX may also redefine the online trading space, some experts think it could be the next 5x crypto coin in 2025. Satoshi Flipper: Ethereum may reach $10,000 Ethereum is a top 5 cryptocurrency now showing green price charts. CoinMarketCap shows that Ethereum has surged nearly 35% in the past month alone. In that time, its value moved between $2,657 and $3,588. Recently, crypto analyst Satoshi Flipper made a bullish Ethereum forecast, exciting many traders. In a new X post, he said that the daily chart for this altcoin is a dream chart at the moment. He predicts Ethereum will soon pass the $4,000 level and may reach $10,000. The technicals for the Ethereum crypto are also showing some good signs. TradingView shows that Ethereum is valued above its 10-day EMA ($3,425). Plus, its MACD level sits at 197, which is in the buy zone and suggests a good entry point for buyers. Shib Knight: SHIB accumulates, further price growth expected As one of the meme coin titans, Shiba Inu has also been rising on the price charts. On the one-month chart, the price of Shiba Inu has jumped from $0.000018 to $0.000025. CoinMarketCap shows a nearly 40% surge in just a few short weeks. Shiba Inu also sees some bullish signs thanks to its technical analysis. TradingView shows that this meme coin trades above its 30-day EMA ($0.000023). Additionally, its momentum indicator sits at 0.00000096, which suggests this bullish trend is continuing. Market expert Shib Knight remains optimistic about the Shiba Inu crypto, too. According to his X post, this meme coin has been accumulating at higher levels, which is perfect. As a Shiba Inu forecast, Knight thinks the next rally may lead it to $0.000037.

Its listing on CoinMarketCap has increased its visibility, opening the door to millions of potential investors. The DTX utility token has already given early buyers a 400% return in its presale run so far. The DTX token will be the main currency for the DTX Exchange, an innovative hybrid exchange. This could make it a fan-favorite for millions as it will have the best CEX and DEX features in one: Lightning-fast transactions: Transactions will take the shortest possible time, just 0.04 seconds. More privacy: No sign-up KYC processes, which will let traders trade under anonymity. Big asset selection: Trade over 120,000 asset classes, including FX, CFDs, and even crypto currencies. Currently, DTX costs just $0.10 as it is in phase five of its presale. But, in phase six, it is expected to jump to $0.12. Moreover, this altcoin is expected to be worth $0.20 after a top-tier CEX lists it soon. With this rise, DTX could be one of the altcoins to watch. What may come for Ethereum, Shiba Inu, and DTX Exchange? The crypto market offers many chances for growth thanks to tokens like Ethereum, Shiba Inu, and DTX Exchange. While all of them may skyrocket, experts are more confident in DTX. Since this project will tap into the $1.4T FX market and have a smaller market cap, it may need less money to see a big price jump. Therefore, they think a 5x surge could come for this altcoin in 2025. To learn more about DTX, visit the presale website , visit the official DTX website , and join the DTX community .

Despite assurances to recover from the breach, the company has failed to stabilize, prompting a deal to transfer customer assets to SBI VC Trade, a subsidiary of the SBI Group, by March 2025. DMM $320M Bitcoin Theft Proves Fatal The May 30 hack, which DMM Bitcoin described as an “unauthorized leak,” led to the theft of over 4,500 Bitcoin from a single wallet. At the time, the exchange halted withdrawals, trading, and new account openings. But it pledged to fully compensate user deposits with the support of its parent company, DMM Group. Despite these assurances, DMM Bitcoin struggled to regain its footing. The loss ranks as the second-largest cryptocurrency theft in Japan’s history, trailing only the $530 million Coincheck hack in 2018. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT linked the DMM breach to the notorious Lazarus Group, citing similarities in laundering tactics and off-chain indicators. SBI VC Trade to Absorb Customer Accounts On December 2, DMM Bitcoin announced an agreement to transfer customer accounts and deposit assets to SBI VC Trade. “Under this agreement, customer deposit assets (in Japanese yen and crypto assets) will be transferred to us as soon as March 2025,” read a statement from SBI VC Trade. The transfer will also include crypto stocks held by DMM Bitcoin users, ensuring a seamless transition for customers. The closure comes amid broader challenges for DMM Bitcoin. In November, the exchange shuttered its Seamoon Protocol, a Web3 gaming and content platform, citing “rapid changes in the business environment.” The platform had also been working with Progmat to issue a stablecoin, but the project was shelved due to sustainability concerns. 2024 has been a rough year for centralized exchanges globally, with high-profile hacks plaguing the industry. Notable breaches include India’s WazirX losing $235 million in July, Singapore’s BingX suffering a $52 million hack in September, and Turkey’s BtcTurk losing up to $55 million in June.

37129908,https://coinpedia.org/?p=387971,1733136926,Key US Economic Events to Watch This Week Which Will Impact the Crypto Market,"The post Key US Economic Events to Watch This Week Which Will Impact the Crypto Market appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market has reached a new high, surpassing $3.4 trillion, as many altcoins outperform Bitcoin . This marks a significant moment for the market. With major economic reports on US jobs, employment claims, and manufacturing due this week, all eyes are on how these events could affect the crypto space. These reports could influence market sentiment and potentially drive the value of both Bitcoin and altcoins. Key US Economic Event For This Week Crypto markets gained last week after Donald Trump chose hedge fund expert Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary. Now, crypto markets are closely watching key US economic data set to be released this week . Dec 2: ISM Manufacturing PMI Report The ISM Manufacturing PMI report for November, set to be released on Monday, Dec 2, will shed light on the U.S. manufacturing sector and overall economic trends. This comes after weak data from the Eurozone, where the Euro dropped to a 23-month low of $1.0336. As the U.S. ISM index is forecasted to rise slightly from 46.5 to 47.5, a weaker USD could drive investors toward Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Dec 3: JOLTS Job Openings On December 3, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics will release October’s JOLTS report, showing job openings, layoffs, and quits. Job openings have steadily fallen since March 2022 but rose to 8.4 million in August before dropping to 7.44 million in September. Meanwhile, October’s forecast is a slight uptick to 7.49 million, as labor market trends remain crucial for Fed policy decisions. Dec 4: National Employment Report On December 4, the ADP National Employment Report will reveal November’s job growth in the private and public sectors. October’s report surprised markets with just 12,000 jobs added, far below expectations. While hiring has been slowing, September showed improvement, with 233,000 jobs added. Earlier weak data has fueled expectations of a Fed rate cut, keeping market attention on this week’s report. Dec 5: Jobless Claims Report The upcoming jobless claims report on December 5 will provide fresh insights into the U.S. labor market. Last week recorded 213,000 claims, with a slight increase to 215,000 expected. Despite fewer initial claims, rising continuing claims suggest employers are holding onto workers, but those laid off are struggling to secure new jobs. Dec 6: US Employment Report On Friday, December 6, all eyes will be on the November employment report, expected to show over 250,000 new jobs. The numbers will reflect the return of Boeing workers and recovery from Hurricane Milton. This comes after weaker PCE data, hinting at a possible Fed rate cut ahead of its December 18 meeting. In addition to this, Friday will also see the preliminary Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index and Inflation Expectations for December, providing a snapshot of consumer confidence and long-term inflation views.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/key-us-economic-events-to-watch-this-week-which-will-impact-the-crypto-market/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE.

37129982,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=621425,1733136625,India’s rupee plunges to all-time low after Trump warned BRICS against dollar dethroning,"India’s rupee has fallen to its lowest point ever, trading at 84.6850 per dollar after a government report revealed the slowest economic growth in two years. But the rupee isn’t just slipping because of domestic issues. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has fired off threats at India and its fellow BRICS members, demanding they abandon their plans to challenge the dollar. The timing couldn’t be worse. India is already grappling with inflation that refuses to drop below the Reserve Bank of India’s 4% target. Now, with Trump’s harsh words looming over global markets, the rupee and emerging-market assets are taking heavy hits. India’s five-year bond yield dropped by nearly six basis points to 6.62%, while traders bet on rate cuts during the Reserve Bank of India’s meeting on December 6. Meanwhile, stocks sank. Investors clearly don’t like what they’re seeing. Trump’s ultimatum to BRICS “The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER,” said Trump. The president warned these countries to drop their plans for a new currency or face devastating consequences, including 100% tariffs and a complete lockout from the U.S. market. “They should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. economy,” Trump added. Throughout his campaign, Trump repeatedly said the dollar must remain the world’s dominant currency. Interestingly, India has actually never backed BRICS discussions on reducing reliance on the dollar. At the bloc’s annual summit in October, leaders, including Russia’s Vladimir Putin, discussed “de-dollarization” as a way to counter U.S. sanctions. While Putin has since softened his tone, saying he no longer aims to dethrone the dollar, Trump’s latest threats suggest the U.S. won’t tolerate even the idea of alternatives. India’s economy is already struggling, and Trump’s pressure is like gasoline on a fire. Goldman Sachs and Barclays both slashed their full-year growth outlooks for India after Friday’s GDP report fell below estimates. The rupee’s fall is just one symptom. Emerging markets, including India, are highly sensitive to a stronger dollar. India’s challenges are internal too. Inflation is stubbornly high, leaving the Reserve Bank of India in a tough spot. A rate cut could help stimulate growth, but it risks worsening inflation. BRICS countries are in turmoil BRICS nations are feeling the heat. While the alliance has pushed back against U.S. dominance for years, Trump’s comeback has the power to shake its unity. Brazil’s CMA agency head, Jose Juan Saches, insists BRICS will stick to its goals. “From an economic standpoint, there will be no issues as long as global markets remain stable,” he said. But stability is exactly what’s missing right now. China, another key BRICS player, faces its own set of problems as Trump expands his threats. Over the past week, Trump unveiled plans for a 10% tariff on Chinese goods and even harsher measures against Canada and Mexico. The decision is tied to broader issues like immigration and drug trafficking. Trump has made it clear that trade with the U.S. will come at a steep cost if these nations don’t fall in line. India, caught in the middle, has little room to maneuver. Aligning with BRICS means risking access to the U.S. market, one of its largest trading partners. Yet stepping back from BRICS could weaken its influence on the global stage.

To put this momentum into perspective, in the last 24 hours, XRP has recorded an inflow of about $26 billion, bringing its market cap to $133 billion as of press time. This inflow has elevated XRP to the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Top 4 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap Regarding price movement, the asset was valued at $2.33 at the time of writing, reflecting a 20% growth in the past 24 hours. Over the past week, the Ripple -affiliated digital currency has surged by over 50%, with gains exceeding 270% in the last month. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Investing in XRP With XRP seemingly establishing a solid upward trajectory after years of consolidation, the question arises: Is it too late to invest in the asset? At its current valuation, XRP is relatively cheap and shows potential for further growth. Now, a cryptocurrency trading expert, using the pseudonym Mags , offered insights in an X post on December 2 regarding whether to invest in XRP. According to the analyst, XRP is trading significantly higher than its recent accumulation phase at $0.35. As such, it might not offer the same risk-to-reward ratio it once did. While further gains are possible, the expert noted that the most profitable opportunities typically arise during low volatility and sideways price action. To this end, he revealed plans to close 75% of his XRP holdings following the recent price surge, intending to rotate into projects with higher upside potential that have not yet experienced similar rallies. Despite taking partial profits, the trader remained bullish on XRP, forecasting a potential price target of $4 during this market cycle. The analyst suggested that XRP is currently in its parabolic phase, advising investors to wait for the asset to re-enter its accumulation phase before purchasing. In his view, XRP follows four phases: the blow-off top, first bounce, accumulation, and parabolic phases. He emphasized that the first three phases offer the ideal opportunity to invest. XRP price analysis chart. Source/Thescalpingpro Drivers of XRP rally XRP’s resurgence has been influenced by Donald Trump’s election victory and Gary Gensler’s announced departure as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The rally also coincides with reports that the New York Department of Financial Services may approve Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin , which is expected to launch on December 4. Additionally, speculation surrounding a potential XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) has fueled the asset’s rally. If such a product is approved, it could drive XRP to new highs. As it stands, XRP is now targeting the $3 mark, with technical indicators supporting this potential move. For instance, the cryptocurrency is trading well above its 50-day ($0.82) and 200-day ($0.62) moving averages ( MA ), reflecting a solid uptrend. However, the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) at 92.51 indicates extreme overbought conditions, suggesting a potential correction ahead.

Toncoin has been on the rise as Telegram dominates Web3 gaming. Cardano has benefited from the optimism of relaxed crypto regulation in the US. This development has turned the attention to 1FUEL (1FUEL). Cardano and Toncoin are blue-chip assets while 1FUEL is a secure crypto wallet in the presale stage. The upcoming altcoin has the potential to surge 100X, with investors impressed by its mouth-watering crypto-staking rewards. After ADA and TON pumped, investors are taking profits and reinvesting in altcoins still at their low prices. Does 1FUEL have what it takes to outpace Toncoin and Cardano as the bull run enters its next stage? Toncoin Soars as Telegram Dominates Web3 Gaming Toncoin has exploded in value as the messaging app Telegram stamps its dominance in Web3 gaming. It has emerged that Telegram accounts for two out of ten new games entering the market in 2024. Telegram’s dominance is attributed to its large user base of more than 950 million active monthly users. Toncoin gained a modest 30% in the past 30 days. This is a far cry from blue chip assets such as Cardano which experienced massive growth. As Toncoin takes a back seat, analysts are convinced the altcoin can mount a credible comeback and print a new all-time high. It has also emerged that Toncoin investors are flocking to 1FUEL for bigger gains. 1FUEL: Altcoin to surge 100x after launch It is an open secret that the most gains are made from investing in presale projects in their earliest stages. This is similar to 1FUEL, a secure crypto wallet with numerous applications in the DeFi space. The upcoming altcoin could surge 100X, a key factor in driving investors to its platform. It has impressed crypto advocates with its mission to promote anonymity and privacy through several built-in features. The project is meant for traders who may otherwise need access to great trading tools. To cater to traders, 1FUEL has AI-powered features that optimize crypto portfolios, execute efficient trades, and help traders with tax reporting. With cross-chain crypto transactions, 1FUEL users don’t need to worry about juggling multiple wallets for different blockchain networks. The crypto wallet is a one-stop shop where users can carry out all their transactions. This saves money through transaction fees. The secure crypto debit cards offered to users are for paying for goods and services. This is the best way for crypto holders to spend their digital assets and help with adoption. It has a P2P exchange platform where users can buy or sell assets directly with each other. This offers users a way of making money while giving them complete control over their assets. Its cold storage for crypto has military-grade security, deterring hackers from trying to exploit users’ assets. In the end, 1FUEL is a secure crypto wallet with lots of features that make it the best cryptocurrency to buy now. Cardano: 88% of ADA’s supply is in profit Nearly nine out of ten of Cardano’s circulating supply is in the money. This comes after Cardano skyrocketed in the past month. While this is great for Cardano holders, it can potentially increase selling pressure for ADA. Investors may cash out their Cardano profits to reinvest in promising projects like 1FUEL. Cardano rose 196% in the past 30 days. It is expected to continue rising as its founder Charles Hoskinson helps to share crypto policy in the US. The crypto space is heating up. Cardano and Toncoin have been calling the shots but it seems there is a new sheriff in town. Still in its crypto stage, 1FUEL is turning heads with its secure crypto wallet and support for cross-chain crypto transactions.

This indicates that exciting times are ahead for the cryptocurrency market , especially for the altcoin market. Let’s dive in to understand the scenario better. Whale Accumulation: What’s Happening in the Crypto Market? The report notes that whales have accumulated as many as $1.6 billion worth of Bitcoin in just the last 3 to 5 weeks. Highlighting the reluctance of retail traders to actively participate in the market, it states that retailers are panic-selling and are holding on to USDT. Though the report does not explain the panic-selling trend among retailers, it asserts that the trend has caused them to miss the growing momentum in the crypto market. Ethereum’s Rising Potential Highlighting the MVRV chart, the report suggests that Ethereum is currently undervalued. Underscoring the tremendous surge in institutional interest in ETH, especially post November 5, it notes that the second largest crypto by market cap is gaining strength. The report also points out that ETF inflows for ETH have exceeded those of Bitcoin. Altcoin Season Is Here The BTC Dominance ratio currently stands at 56.90%. On November 5, it stood at 60.55%. On November 9, it dropped to a low of 58.79%. Between November 10 and 13, it rose from 58.77% to 61.06%. After a small correction of 2.24%%, it peaked at 61.20% by November 20. Since November 21, it has dropped almost consistently. As per the report, in April and November 2021, imbalances in the BTC-Bitcoin ratio preceded significant Bitcoin corrections. Stressing that the current BTC-ALT ratio indicates altcoins are undervalued, the report forecasts that the altcoin market is entering a strong growth phase. There are rumours that BlackRock and JPMorgan are preparing to launch XRP ETFs . Interestingly, these rumours also reinforce the altcoin season narrative. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Key US Economic Events to Watch This Week Which Will Impact the Crypto Market , Crypto Expert’s Bold Prediction for 2025 The crypto expert forecasts that the altcoin market will achieve the enviable market cap of $1.4 trillion by the first quarter of the year 2025.

This initiative shows the increasingly important intersection between traditional banking practices and the evolving world of blockchain technology. As financial institutions recognize the potential of digital currencies, such investments are becoming more common. Concurrently, new revelations regarding the politically motivated collapse of Meta’s ambitious Diem project provide valuable insights into the myriad challenges that innovators in the blockchain space are currently facing. Meta’s Diem: A Political Kill of a Revolutionary Payments Network David Marcus, the co-creator of Meta’s now-defunct blockchain payments project Diem, has described the demise of the ambitious initiative as a politically motivated takedown. Speaking in a Nov. 30 post on X, Marcus pointed to political pressure from US regulators as the primary reason for the project’s failure, despite its robust legal and regulatory framework. “There was no legal or regulatory angle left for the government or regulators to kill the project. It was 100% a political kill—one that was executed through intimidation of captive banking institutions,” Marcus stated. His comments shed new light on the challenges faced by one of the most high-profile blockchain projects ever attempted by a tech giant. Launched in June 2019 as Libra, Diem was conceived as a decentralized payments network featuring a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. With backers like Visa and PayPal, and under the stewardship of Meta (then Facebook), the project promised to revolutionize global payments. Its goal was to address inefficiencies in cross-border transactions and offer a scalable, accessible financial solution. However, the announcement of Libra sparked immediate scrutiny. Just two weeks after the project’s unveiling, Marcus, who had previously served as President of PayPal, was summoned to testify before the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee. Lawmakers raised concerns about potential risks, including money laundering, financial stability, and consumer protection. What followed was a relentless effort to address regulatory issues and garner approval. Despite these efforts, Marcus revealed that the project faced a unique challenge: political resistance that extended beyond the purview of regulatory compliance. A Political Quagmire According to Marcus, Diem’s fate was sealed by political opposition rather than any regulatory deficiency. After making significant adjustments to address concerns, the project had secured tentative support from Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell, who was willing to allow a limited launch. However, Marcus claimed that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen advised Powell that permitting the project to proceed would be “political suicide.” The situation escalated when the Federal Reserve reportedly discouraged banks from participating in the initiative, effectively cutting off critical financial infrastructure. Without the support of banking partners, Meta was forced to abandon the project. In early 2022, Meta sold Diem’s intellectual property and assets to Silvergate Capital. Tragically, Silvergate itself went into voluntary liquidation in March 2023 and filed for bankruptcy later that year. Marcus’s revelations came in response to comments made by Marc Andreessen, a prominent venture capitalist, on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Andreessen had discussed the broader political pressures faced by the tech and blockchain industries, prompting Marcus to share his firsthand experience. Reflecting on the lessons learned from the Diem project, Marcus said, “If you’re trying to build an open money grid for the world—eventually moving trillions of dollars a day, designed to be here 100 years from now—you have to build it on the most neutral, decentralized, unassailable network and asset.” For Marcus, that network is “hands down” Bitcoin. Since leaving Diem, Marcus has doubled down on his belief in Bitcoin’s potential. He now serves as CEO of Lightspark, a payments company leveraging Bitcoin and its layer-2 Lightning Network to enable faster and cheaper transactions. The demise of Diem highlights the intersection of innovation, regulation, and politics in the tech industry. Advocates argue that the project could have addressed long standing inefficiencies in the global financial system, particularly in cross-border payments. Critics, however, saw it as a potential threat to monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Marcus’s statements shed some light on the challenges that blockchain projects face in navigating complex regulatory environments, particularly in jurisdictions like the United States. His experience serves as both a cautionary tale and a call to action for innovators aiming to build decentralized financial systems. While Diem’s vision remains unrealized, its legacy continues to influence the blockchain space. Marcus’s pivot to Bitcoin reflects a broader trend of developers and entrepreneurs seeking decentralized solutions that are resistant to political interference. As regulatory scrutiny of blockchain technology persists, the story of Diem serves as a reminder of the importance of fostering an environment that balances innovation with oversight. Singapore Gulf Bank Seeks $50 Million Fund Injection for Strategic Expansion into Stablecoin Payments In other stablecoin news, Singapore Gulf Bank, a prominent crypto-friendly digital bank operated by the Whampoa Group, is reportedly exploring a $50 million fund injection as part of its ambitious plans to acquire a stablecoin payments company by early 2025. According to a Nov. 25 Bloomberg report , the bank is willing to sell a 10% equity stake to secure the necessary capital. This strategic move, if realized, would further solidify Singapore Gulf Bank’s position as a leader in the evolving financial ecosystem that bridges traditional banking and blockchain-based payments. According to anonymous sources cited in the report, Singapore Gulf Bank is actively engaging with a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund and other investors to facilitate the equity sale. The proceeds are earmarked for multiple initiatives, including product development, expanding its payment network, and acquiring specialized talent. Most notably, the funds will support the acquisition of a stablecoin payments company based in either the Middle East or Europe by the first quarter of 2025. This acquisition would bolster the bank's capability to cater to the burgeoning demand for blockchain-based payment solutions, particularly in regions demonstrating significant cryptocurrency adoption. Singapore Gulf Bank operates under the Whampoa Group, a Singapore-based family office that recently secured an operational license in Bahrain. This expansion aligns with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region’s growing interest in fostering Web3 innovation and blockchain technology. The Middle East, particularly nations like Bahrain, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi, has emerged as a key hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain development. According to a September report by Chainalysis, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region accounted for 7.5% of global cryptocurrency transactions, indicating the region's growing importance in the Web3 ecosystem. Shifting Dynamics: Large Transactions and Institutional Interest The Chainalysis report revealed that 93% of crypto transactions in MENA involved amounts exceeding $10,000, highlighting the dominance of institutional and large-scale investors in the region. Conversely, smaller retail investors contributed just 1.8% of the transaction volume. Centralized exchanges dominate on-chain activity, but there is a rising interest in decentralized platforms, particularly in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia. This trend aligns with recent regulatory advancements in the region. For example, the UAE’s Central Bank has approved a custodial insurance product to protect financial institutions and their clients from losses due to hacks, internal fraud, and damage to storage infrastructure, signaling a commitment to fostering a secure and robust digital asset ecosystem. Stablecoins , digital assets pegged to fiat currencies, have become a linchpin for cross-border transactions and decentralized finance (DeFi). By acquiring a stablecoin payments firm, Singapore Gulf Bank aims to position itself as a key player in this transformative sector, potentially reshaping the way digital and traditional finance intersect. The acquisition would not only enhance the bank’s payment network but also align with its broader strategy of tapping into the global demand for seamless, low-cost payment solutions. Such a move would provide a significant competitive edge in the global banking landscape, where the integration of blockchain technology and traditional banking services is becoming increasingly vital. As Singapore Gulf Bank pursues this bold expansion strategy, it signals the growing convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology. The planned acquisition of a stablecoin payments company is evidence of the bank’s forward-looking vision as well as its push to drive innovation in the financial sector. Should the $50 million fund injection materialize, it could set a precedent for other financial institutions looking to integrate Web3 solutions. With the Middle East emerging as a hotbed for cryptocurrency innovation and adoption, Singapore Gulf Bank’s strategic initiatives could play a pivotal role in shaping the future of digital banking.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6333/meta-s-diem-shut-down-amid-political-pressure-says-co-creator,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Bitcoin enthusiast Michael Saylor pitched Bitcoin as a “choice of progression” to Microsoft’s board of directors in a presentation that went a little over 3 minutes. He claimed that BTC could achieve a market cap of $280 trillion by 2045. Michael Saylor calls for Microsoft to convert its bonds and dividends to Bitcoin He called for Microsoft to convert their bonds and buybacks to Bitcoin, arguing that the traditional investments only amplify the company’s risk factors. According to Saylor, investing in BTC eliminates counterparty risk from competitors, countries, corporations, creditors, cultures, or currencies. He projected that if the tech mogul redirected all treasury funds, debt, cash flows, dividends, and share buyback allocations into BTC, its share price could spike to $584 within the next decade, assuming the coin’s value reaches $1.7 million per coin by the end of 2034. Saylor also proposed that Microsoft invest $100 billion annually in the asset, claiming it’s more practical for the company to purchase BTC instead of repurchasing stock and holding bonds. He said: “What if you could buy a $100 billion company growing faster than Microsoft for one-time revenue? What if you could keep doing it every single year?” – Michael Saylor Moreover, he believes Microsoft could see increments between $1 trillion and $4.9 trillion in shareholder value via Bitcoin by 2034. Saylor argues that support for Bitcoin is growing, asking Microsoft to jump on the train In his YouTube video on Dec 1, Saylor also argued that BTC’s public and political support is incredibly rising, citing examples of notable political heads who expressed pro-crypto sentiments, including President-elect Donald Trump. Saylor also commented on how Wall Street support for BTC is growing, as firms like Blackrock heavily invest in and advocate for the asset. He has called on Microsoft to assess its Bitcoin investment strategy and do the “right thing for the world and adopt Bitcoin”. Still, market analysts believe Microsoft’s BTC investment decision will rely partially on institutional shareholders like Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street.

Could this be a roll-over, down from the top of nearly $100,000, or is this just a period of consolidation and accumulation before going much higher? Third successive downward day for Bitcoin Around 2% down early on Monday, the Bitcoin price is on its third downward day since hitting $98,200, which failed to make a higher high. In fact, the $BTC price has been rolling over since almost hitting the all-time high on Friday 22 November. We are now into December, and this slight downward trend has not been arrested yet. Could it continue, or will the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, Microstrategy, and all the various institutions adding Bitcoin to their treasury, force the price back up again? Bitcoin price traverses inside triangle Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for $BTC is not showing signs of any heavy downside to come - at least not yet. The price is in a triangle, formed by the series of lower highs, but countered by the higher lows. The price has fallen below the 0.382 Fibonacci for this latest move, and is currently heading down to the 5.0 Fibonacci. If it falls below this, the major Fibonacci supports of the 0.618 and the 0.786 await below. There is also the bottom trendline of the triangle to act as support. Looking at the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI is coming down to the bottom, and once the 8-hour and the 12-hour Stochastic RSIs also come down to their respective bottoms, the bounce would potentially be primed, if not already happening. Could this next bounce have the impetus to break though the top of the triangle? Considering that Bitcoin usually does not wait until the end of triangles to break one way or the other, we should find out, once, and if, the price does get back up to the top trendline again. If the $BTC price falls through the bottom of the triangle, all eyes need to watch for whether the price goes below $90,700. If this happened, it would register a lower low, and would break the upside trend. Bullish hammer candle versus bearish Stochastic RSI cross down Source: TradingView Looking at the $BTC price on the weekly time frame, it can be seen that after the huge set of three green weekly candles, the price has now started to either roll over and down, or is consolidating before going higher. The big factor in the bull’s favour is that last week’s candle has closed in the form of a hammer candle. This would often be found at the bottom of a downward phase in price, and would signal a trend reversal. However, if it forms during an upward price movement, it has the potential to signal a continuation of that movement. That said, one of the factors that currently favours the bears, is that the weekly Stochastic RSI has confirmed a cross down of the indicators. This would normally signal that upside price momentum was leaving the market. Be that as it may, there is still the chance that the 75.00 level could act as a support and help to turn these two indicator lines back around. The next few weeks will be very important in this regard. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As the first AI project on the TON chain, NEUTON is well-positioned for growth, supported by a strong roadmap targeting listings on high-tier exchanges. With its innovative foundation and potential support from the TON Foundation, NEUTON is likely to gain further traction, increasing its chances of being onboarded by major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Analysts predict NEUTON has the potential to achieve 100x returns by 2025, making it a compelling project to watch closely.

Despite its infamous volatility, Bitcoin has consistently demonstrated its profitability, earning its place as a crucial asset for professional investors. Institutional investments continue to pour into Bitcoin, with many analysts forecasting a bullish trajectory. Some even predict its value could reach $100,000 in the coming years. With its enduring dominance and potential for significant growth, Bitcoin remains a must-watch cryptocurrency, leaving many wishing they had invested sooner. Polkadot (DOT): Polkadot (DOT) presents a groundbreaking blockchain concept, making it a promising cryptocurrency to consider. Its unique architecture enhances scalability by enabling independent blockchain networks to share resources and exchange information seamlessly. At the core of its protocol are parachains—specialized, modular blockchains interconnected within the Polkadot ecosystem. The native DOT token serves essential roles in governance, staking, and liquidity provision. As of October 2024, DOT is valued at $4.17, reflecting its potential for significant growth as its infrastructure and ecosystem continue to expand. With robust cross-chain capabilities and a rapidly evolving network, Polkadot offers an enticing opportunity for long-term profitability. Now might be the perfect time to explore its potential. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is another cryptocurrency you’d regret not buying earlier, as it addresses key challenges like blockchain scalability, interoperability, and sustainability. With the surge in decentralized economies, DeFi products, smart contracts, and NFTs, Cardano is strategically positioned for rapid growth. As of October 2024, ADA’s affordable price of $0.36 makes it an attractive option for investors betting on this transformative technology’s future.

37128948,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106430,1733134985,$BIAO: The Biggest Meme in the East,"In the crypto world, where narratives shape markets and cultural relevance fuels growth, meme coins have carved out a unique niche. While $PEPE reigns as the largest meme coin in the West, with a staggering valuation of $10 billion, the East has its own contender: $BIAO. Currently valued at just $20 million, $BIAO holds the potential to not only bridge this valuation gap but also become a global sensation. The Rise of Media-Driven Coins Crypto markets often thrive on media-driven narratives. We’ve seen it before with $PEPE’s meteoric rise, fueled by online hype and cultural resonance. Stocks like GameStop ($GME) surged in Q2 due to media attention, and other tokens have followed similar trajectories. The success formula is clear: when media and social platforms converge, they create a frenzy of speculation and investment. Why $BIAO Stands Out $BIAO isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a cultural phenomenon in the East, mirroring $PEPE’s role in the West. With a strong narrative foundation as “China’s Pepe,” $BIAO is uniquely positioned to capitalize on both cultural identity and global market trends. Moreover, speculation about China’s shifting stance on cryptocurrency has dominated conversations throughout 2024. Over the past two weeks, China has made significant moves, including unbanning various technologies and recently cutting crypto taxes for hedge funds. These developments suggest a warming attitude toward crypto, with many anticipating a full unbanning in Q4. The Opportunity Ahead When China officially embraces crypto, the resulting media coverage is expected to flood crypto-focused social platforms and news outlets. This will likely spark massive FOMO (fear of missing out) among investors, especially for tokens with strong ties to Chinese culture. $BIAO, as the region’s premier meme coin, could become a focal point of this movement. With a population of over 3 billion in the East, the potential for $BIAO is monumental. Investors are essentially front-running a wave of interest that could see $BIAO achieve valuations reminiscent of $PEPE’s success. Conclusion As the East’s biggest meme coin, $BIAO stands at the crossroads of cultural significance, media-driven hype, and evolving regulatory landscapes. For those willing to recognize its potential, $BIAO represents more than just a speculative play—it’s a chance to ride the wave of a global meme coin revolution. Now is the time to watch closely, as $BIAO’s narrative unfolds and the East’s crypto market steps into the spotlight.

37128703,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311283,1733134529,"Crypto Market About To Enter Altcoin Season, Says Fundstrat’s Tom Lee – Here’s When","Fundstrat’s Tom Lee says that digital assets are likely approaching the time when smaller altcoins begin to outshine the larger-cap cryptocurrencies. In a new interview on the Wealthion podcast with SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, Lee says his firm has already begun recommending Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) to clients as a way to move out of the risk curve from Bitcoin ( BTC ). Lee, head of research at Fundstrat, says that investors holding altcoins may have some “alpha” as the market cycle develops. “The answer is yes. We’ve recommended to our clients that if they didn’t want to be Bitcoin-only, that they could look at Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana because we’ve put those largely in the same category as sort of core cryptos. We are also entering what I think is altseason. Next year is really when I think the crypto market could broaden and this is where those who are really experts on crypto… actually are going to have some alpha because that is actually when many altcoins could do really well. I think that the stronger Bitcoin is, the stronger the ecosystem becomes and so so many of these utility tokens and things that are tokenizing really start to have a lot of expected value.” In the same interview, Lee said that a further 150% move for Bitcoin on top of its already big gains is very likely. “Over the next twelve months, I think something over $250,000 is possible, but maybe highly probable based on just following this price cycle. The second reason I think Bitcoin has maybe more upside than that is because the new administration has run on a pro-Bitcoin platform, and I think the possibility of the US not only legitimizing Bitcoin but making it a strategic reserve asset, I think raises what would be the possible price scenarios for Bitcoin because if the US government, as the intend, ultimately gets to a million Bitcoin it will be the largest Bitcoin holder in the world and they exert an enormous positive influence on legitimizing Bitcoin. I would add to that… It’s almost like taking a playbook from MicroStrategy because MicroStrategy has proven that using Bitcoin as a balance sheet asset has really created a lot of value for MicroStrategy shareholders.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $97,521.

According to the data from Tokenomist , the total value of scheduled unlocks exceeds $1.14 billion. This marks one of the largest coordinated token releases in recent market history. Jito leads cliff-based token releases Jito stands at the forefront, with 137.44 million tokens valued at $507.14 million scheduled for release. This represents 104.32% of Jito’s current circulating supply. This massive unlock is followed by NEON’s planned release of 53.91 million tokens worth $24.01 million. It will impact 44.92% of its supply. The cliff unlock schedule continues with Cardano (ADA) releasing 18.53 million tokens ($21.31 million). However, this represents a mere 0.05% of its total supply. TAIKO follows with 9.29 million tokens ($20.25 million), affecting 11.38% of supply, while BANANA plans to release 250.00K tokens ($16.66 million), impacting 7.21% of circulation. Additional releases include ENA’s 12.86 million tokens ($10.57 million) and AGI’s 34.66 tokens ($8.06 million). Solana leads linear token unlocks The linear unlock sector is dominated by established projects, with Solana (SOL) releasing 524.03K tokens valued at $123.34 million (0.11% of supply) and Worldcoin (WLD) releasing 37.23 million tokens worth $124.71 million (5.16% of supply). These controlled releases demonstrate a more measured approach to supply management. Other major linear unlocks include: &]:mt-2 list-disc space-y-2 pl-8""> TIA: 6.99 million tokens ($55.42 million), 1.60% of supply DOGE: 94.47 million tokens ($42.91 million), 0.06% of supply TAO: 50.40K tokens ($31.87 million), 0.68% of supply AVAX: 700.00K tokens ($31.75 million), 0.17% of supply SEI: 26.97 million tokens ($17.36 million), 0.68% of supply The schedule extends to include NEAR, SUI, DOT, FIL, ENS, ARKM, and ATOM, with values ranging from $7.23 million to $26.40 million, representing varying percentages of their respective circulating supplies. Less popular token unlocks Several lesser-known projects show a considerable amount of upcoming unlocks that could impact their market dynamics. According to CoinMarketCap data , Neutron (NTRN) displays 19.98% unlock progress toward releasing 9.96 million tokens ($5.21M) at a current price of $0.5235, despite an 11.85% daily decline. Source: CoinMarketCap Flash Protocol (FLASH) demonstrates 16.74% progress with 163.83 million tokens ($24.17 million) scheduled, while trading at $0.0001475 with a 4.22% daily gain. Cyber Arena (CAT) shows particularly strong unlock progress at 52.93%, approaching its 63.37 million token release. Arcana Network (XAR) and BRC App (BRCT) are also preparing large releases, with XAR at 22.59% progress toward 24.59 million tokens and BRCT reaching 49.84% progress for its 45.89 million token unlock. The diverse range of unlock structures and sizes suggests varying potential market impacts across different cryptocurrency segments. Projects with large supply increases relative to circulation, such as Jito (104.32%) and NEON (44.92%), may experience heightened price volatility. The price of Jito is currently down by over 9.5% in the last 24 hours. In contrast, established projects employing linear unlock strategies might see more stable price action. Traders and investors should monitor these events carefully, particularly for tokens where unlocks represent substantial portions of circulating supply. The gradual nature of linear unlocks for major projects like SOL, WLD, and DOGE may help maintain market stability, while smaller projects’ cliff unlocks could create more immediate price impacts.

Analyst Targets 30,000%","Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X), a prominent crypto analyst on X, recently predicted an extraordinary rally for XRP. Referencing insights from a CNBC Fast Money analysis by Brian Kelly, Brett suggested that XRP’s prolonged consolidation over recent years has created the foundation for a significant price surge. He boldly forecasted a potential price of over $100 for XRP, fueled by a parabolic rally similar to its historic performance in 2017. The Bigger the Base, the Higher in Space XRP Isn’t Just Another Crypto Pump—It’s Set for a 2017-Style Parabolic Rally! #XRP Could Easily Skyrocket Over $100 in a Day, Eyeing a 30,000% $XRP pic.twitter.com/vfVveTRV5V — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) November 30, 2024 Long-Term Consolidation as a Bullish Indicator Brett shared a video where Kelly referenced a technical principle from prominent technical analyst Louise Yamada: “The bigger the base, the higher in space.” The principle suggests that prolonged periods of consolidation in an asset’s price often serve as a foundation for explosive upward movements. XRP, which has seen significant consolidation since 2018, fits this narrative. This prolonged consolidation could indicate growing support levels and a reduction in speculative volatility, both of which are critical for a substantial price breakout. XRP is in a unique situation, as it is one of few cryptocurrencies with a consolidation period that lasted for years. Well-known crypto analysts have shown that XRP has been consolidating for almost 7 years . This phase began after its all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018. The digital asset is finally experiencing the resurgence the market has been waiting for, recently breached $2 resistance, a level not seen since 2018. As the asset breaches key resistance levels, it could fuel the parabolic move above $100 that Brett predicted. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Utility as a Driving Force While speculative trading has traditionally influenced the cryptocurrency market, Kelly emphasized in the video that XRP’s price rally would be driven by its underlying utility. Kelly pointed to XRP’s role in cross-border payments and its ability to replace traditional foreign currency transactions as a core use case. Ripple’s partnerships with financial institutions globally and the increasing adoption of On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services further bolster the case for XRP’s potential growth. These developments suggest that XRP’s value could shift from mere speculation to one that reflects its practical application in the financial sector. Is the $100 Target Plausible or Overambitious? Brett’s prediction of XRP reaching $100 represents a staggering increase from its current price of $2.16. While such a scenario may seem improbable, many did not believe XRP would hit the $2 level in 2024, and historical precedents in the cryptocurrency market lend credibility to the possibility.

37128463,https://finbold.com/?p=216243,1733134001,"‘Rich Dad’ R. Kiyosaki warns Bitcoin will crash to $60,000","The famed Bitcoin ( BTC ) bull and author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘ Rich Dad Poor Dad ’ Robert Kiyosaki’s most recent X post indicates, at face value, that the prominent investor has finally turned bearish on the cryptocurrency. Specifically, Kiyosaki concluded that BTC’s stalling slightly short of $100,000 indicates it is bound for a substantial correction and predicted the coin might plunge as low as $60,000. Despite the bearish forecast, the famous author quickly turned his argument optimistic, explaining that such a cryptocurrency market move would, in fact, constitute a Bitcoin ‘sale’ and stressed that he would not be selling and would instead use the opportunity to buy more BTC. Bitcoin is stalled short of $100k. That means BTC may crash to $60k. If and when that happens I will not sell. BTC will be having a sale. I will buy more. Additionally, the prominent investor added he still estimates the coin would reach $250 – likely meaning $250,000 – in 2025. BITCOIN to CRASH Bitcoin is stalled short of $100k. That means BTC may crash to $60k. If and when that happens I will not sell. BTC will be having a sale. I will buy more. I predict Bitcoin will settle around $250 in 2025. At this stage of the BTC process… price is not… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 1, 2024 Robert Kiyosaki says ‘FOMO is good’ then warns of a correction While not uncharacteristically bearish, the X post can be seen as somewhat odd, perhaps even contradictory. Indeed, while Kiyosaki predicted a plunge to $60,000 on December 1, on November 30, he opined Bitcoin will soon climb to $100,000 and added ‘FOMO is good’ while urging his followers not to ‘be left behind.’ Additionally, the author also explained in the November 30 post that the ‘rich will get richer’ while describing the rich and the soon-to-be rich as those who are invested in gold , silver , and Bitcoin. THE RICH WILL GET RICHER: Q: WHO WiLL BE RICHER? A: The people who save Gold, Silver. Bitcoin. I own all three financial assets. Q: WhO WILL BE POORER?

Simultaneously, the famous investor raised another of his long-standing talking points: that those who save American dollars and other similar currencies will grow poorer since ‘cash is trash.’ Finally, while it is impossible why Robert Kiyosaki changed his prediction from $100,000 Bitcoin being right around the corner to a looming correction to $60,000 before the high target is reached within approximately 24 hours, both posts fall in line with the author’s broader narrative. Specifically, he has, in general, been recommending BTC no matter the circumstances – and, indeed, in the December 1 post, he stated that ‘price is not as important.’ Given the author’s $250,000 forecast for 2025, and his agreement with MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ) Michael Saylor’s $14 million 20-year price target, it shouldn’t matter if a trader purchases Bitcoin at its press time price of $95,358 or after a correction to $60,000 or another price. Bitcoin price chart Whatever the truth and accuracy of Robert Kiyosaki’s overall forecasts ends up being, Bitcoin’s most recent performance indicates there is truth to the correction prediction. Specifically, BTC began dropping late on December 1, and it stands at $95,358 at press time. BTC 7-day price chart.

37128690,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51167,1733133670,This Shiba Inu Competitor Will Rocket 36x in the Next 58 Days,"A rising rival to Shiba Inu, Rexas Finance (RXS) is causing a stir in the cryptocurrency market. Setting Rexas Finance aside as a possible industry game-changer, market analysts project an amazing 36x spike for it within the next 58 days. Although Shiba Inu has lately been successful, Rexas Finance’s original method of real-world asset tokenization makes it a strong competitor for control in the crypto industry. Shiba Inu Breaks Key Resistance Having broken a major resistance level at $0.00002236, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has attracted interest since it indicates fresh optimistic momentum. As investor mood rises, crypto market expert Crypto Sheriff underlines this important breakthrough on X and notes how SHIB can reach even more profits. This hope is highlighted by the token’s recent increase in trading volume—more than 4.28 trillion SHIB traded in just 24 hours. With a dramatic 78.91% growth in value this month, SHIB peaked at $0.00002938, which has inspired aspirations among its community for even greater price benchmarks. Problems still exist even with the fresh enthusiasm. To achieve $0.001, SHIB would have to climb astonishingly 3858% and by 296% to reach $0.0001. These high ambitions draw attention to the requirement of major market support. Although continuous improvements to Shibarium, the layer-2 scaling solution, could offer the required velocity, researchers warn that these benchmarks are far from being assured. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Strong Contender to Shiba Inu Rexas Finance (RXS) is fast acquiring popularity and challenging Shiba Inu’s supremacy as it strives to keep its place. Rexas Finance is a revolutionary platform meant to tokenize actual assets such as real estate, artwork, and intellectual property, not only another cryptocurrency. Rexas Finance streamlines the difficult asset tokenizing process by combining user-friendly tools with strong blockchain technology, enabling everyone to use it. Unlike Shiba Inu, which mostly depends on community-driven momentum, Rexas Finance offers actual benefits. Setting a new benchmark in the crypto industry, the platform’s innovative methodology democratizes asset ownership, improves transparency, and brings efficiencies in transactions. The path Rexas Finance took to become successful was equally unusual. Avoiding venture capitalism, the project gathered money via a very successful presale that has already generated over 233% returns since its September 8 launch. This performance emphasizes the increasing investor confidence in Rexas Finance and much exceeds the recent expansion of Shiba Inu. Rexas Finance has raised an amazing $17,626,475 as of writing while in Stage 8 of its presale. Presale is 89.23% complete, with 258,762,493 tokens sold at $0.10; demand is still rising. The strong market interest shown by this fast development helps Rexas Finance to be a leading competitor in the cryptocurrency field. The $1,000,000 Rexas Millionaire Giveaway is one of the elements generating this interest. With over 325,728 entries drawn in response to this effort, which offers 20 winners $50,000 worth of RXS tokens per, project enthusiasm has been heightened. The gift increases community involvement as more investors swarm the platform, hence driving the value of the token. The latest Certik audit of Rexas Finance has also strengthened its reputation since it guarantees investors the dependability and security of the platform. Investors may now quickly monitor the development of RXS tokens pre- and post-listing through CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. The Case for Rexas Finance’s 36x Surge Rexas Finance leads the unexplored real-world asset tokenizing sector as the crypto economy moves into a bullish phase. From its present price of $0.10, analysts project the token might soar 36x in the next 58 days, reaching $3.60. For early buyers, this projection shows an amazing comeback. In contrast, although Shiba Inu shows promise, its road to major benchmarks is yet unknown and mostly dependent on technological developments and market attitude. Conversely, Rexas Finance presents a more appealing choice for investors seeking significant returns since it presents a clear value proposition anchored in creativity and utility. Conclusion Rexas Finance is becoming a major rival ready to change the cryptocurrency market while Shiba Inu keeps making news with its optimistic enthusiasm. Rexas Finance presents a special investment possibility with its emphasis on transparent operations, real-world asset tokenizing, and active community projects. Rexas Finance’s projected 36x explosion in the next 58 days places it as a must-watch competitor in the crypto sector for investors looking for an exponential increase.

37128683,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=621121,1733133630,Blockchains like Solana and Aptos still thrive despite high revenue-to-expense ratios,"As 2024 draws to a close, the yearly revenues and expenses for leading chains are becoming clearer. The incentive structure of some chains suggests much more incentives paid out while subsidizing apps that generate value. Blockchains in 2024 showed different levels of efficiency when comparing their expenses in the form of block rewards to their total revenues from apps and transactions. This metric is a relatively recent tool to gauge the most promising platforms with viable products. In the second half of 2024, most chains got a boost from active users and hosted highly active fat-fee apps. Despite this, most chains remain relatively inefficient, posting a net loss each month as they pay out validators. The expense side of the ratio is tied to block rewards and validator payouts. For some chains, the incentives are key to build security and reliable validator presence, so it is a difficult decision to cut expenses. However, some chains achieve much better ratios between their revenues and expenses. A ratio of high expenses is not necessarily disqualifying for a blockchain. In some cases, this is due to the chain’s commitment to achieving extremely low fees. The low fees in turn attract various apps and activities, which are not prohibitive to regular users. Why is Aptos still posting losses? The reported loss of Aptos is just a reflection of its incentives to validators. The network is actually producing value for those key participants – similar to Bitcoin paying out to miners, or Ethereum’s payouts to its current list of validators. In November, Aptos posted a loss of more than $55M, with revenues of $160K from transactions and other use cases. The high expenses also include network inflation, which is above 7%. Aptos has to support 151 validator nodes , spread across 22 countries and 49 cities. Validators are also striking a balance between their APT rewards, and the need to stake tokens to improve their voting influence. In the year to date, Aptos spent $494M for incentives, to produce $1.38M in revenues from network usage. For some, this result is highly inefficient, but it is also a subsidy of network growth. In 2024, Aptos started off with 124K daily active users , and is getting closer to 1M daily active users after rapid growth in H2. The high issuance of APT tokens is mitigated by staking, where users are not immediately incentivized to sell their tokens. As a result, APT keeps a range between $6 and $17 for the past year, with three distinct rallies. Additionally, unstaking APT can take up to 30 days, further delaying mass selling. Deflation makes TRON more efficient TRON is the only L1 network with net earnings in 2024. One of the reasons is that TRX is a deflationary token, burning more than it produces. While validators are paid in TRX, the issuance is slowing down at a predetermined pace, with the occasional larger burn. Networks that are currently inefficient are still in their early stages. In the case of Aptos, the chain is now building up its stablecoin supply. TRON, on the other hand, carries more than 61.7B USDT, accruing fees from the stablecoin usage. Ethereum (ETH) relies on small inflation. Even with incentives, Ethereum is close to breakeven, paying out $1.14 for each $1 in revenues. It must be noted that some Ethereum apps retain or distribute their revenues to their own ecosystem, with only partial payments to Ethereum. Aptos is lagging, since it is on an accelerated issuance schedule. Only around 41% of the supply are unlocked, with additional inflows at regular intervals. Similar early-stage networks also have a high cost of each dollar earned. For Solana, the recent expansion of meme tokens is helping the bottom line. At the same time, Solana spends more than $7 for each $1 in revenues. Outside the L1 bottom line, Solana apps are mostly in the green. Even older networks like Avalanche spend more than $62 for each $1 in revenues. Fantom, a mid-range network, spends more than $29 for its revenues. In general, L2 chains are also burdened by paying a rent to Ethereum, especially after the recent competition for blob fees .

37128233,https://coinpedia.org/?p=387954,1733133499,Litecoin to Follow XRP Price Rally: Could It Hit $420 Soon?,"The post Litecoin to Follow XRP Price Rally: Could It Hit $420 Soon? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is buzzing with excitement as many analysts are betting high for the biggest altseason ever, potentially starting in the next 8-10 days. Back in late 2021, when Bitcoin’s dominance dipped, altcoins exploded with over 140% growth. Experts now see similar conditions brewing, with Bitcoin pushing toward $100,000. After Bitcoin’s rally, altcoins often take the lead, and this could be a golden chance for massive gains, especially for selective altcoins. Veteran trader Peter Brandt weighed in on this, suggesting that Litecoin could hit $420, similar to XRP’s recent rise . He posted a chart on social media comparing the two coins, which has excited the crypto traders looking to diversify their portfolios. Surprisingly, Litecoin (LTC) is showing some quick price movements. The coin surged by over 21% in just one day, currently trading above $120, and its trading volume reached $2.58 billion, signaling strong interest from investors. Keeping the indicators and chart in mind analysts think Litecoin could follow in the footsteps of XRP, which recently experienced a massive rally. Is Litecoin Ready for Altcoin Season? The Altcoin Season Index is at 59, meaning Bitcoin is still leading the market, but some altcoins like Litecoin are starting to rise and show promise. The key factor that boosted this bullish sentiment is the renewed interest of big bulls in the crypto market, boosted by Donald Trump’s election victory and the potential resignation of US SEC Chair Gary Gensler . These events are fueling expectations of more favorable regulations for cryptocurrencies. Plus, the possibility of a Litecoin ETF approval in the US has traders excited, as it could increase demand for the asset. Based on the charts he also sees a better opportunity for XRP which hit $2 today and flipped major coins like Solana and USDT in market cap.

He compared Litecoin’s chart to XRP’s recent price action, suggesting that Litecoin could soon experience a similar upward surge. Severino speculates that LTC could even reach its all-time high of $412, or potentially higher. Meanwhile, Crypto Snorlax emphasized the strong correlation between old altcoins like Litecoin and XRP. He pointed out that Litecoin just broke above an 18-month resistance level, which he sees as a sign that the coin could rally further, possibly reaching new heights of $450. Moreover, Litecoin is gaining attention with its strong market momentum and upcoming network upgrades, making it a promising altcoin to watch for potentially explosive growth during the current altseason.

While it is wondered whether the rise in XRP will continue at full speed, 50-year analyst Peter Brandt argued that another altcoin could follow the rise in XRP and experience a boom. Experienced analyst Peter Brandt said that this altcoin is Litecoin (LTC) and noted that LTC could follow XRP's strong rise in the coming days. At this point, Brandt, who claimed that the Litecoin price could rise to $420, managed to attract the attention of investors with this prediction. “Could Litecoin be another XRP?” Brandt wrote.

The Monday morning Asian trading session saw a brief price surge to over $98,000, but BTC was quickly and violently rejected. In the following hours, the asset slumped by over three grand and slipped below $95,000 for the first time since Friday.

The broker noted that on Friday Blackrock's spot ether ETF saw inflows of $250 million, versus only $137 million of inflows for the asset manager's larger spot bitcoin ETF.  ""This creates favorable demand-supply dynamics for ETH,"" analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.  Staking yields could be another tailwind for the cryptocurrency. Bernstein noted that initial ether spot ETF applications did not include yields due to regulatory limitations.    ""Under a new Trump 2.0 crypto friendly SEC, ETH staking yield will likely be approved,"" the authors wrote, adding that as activity on the Ethereum blockchain increases the yield can grow to 4-5%.  Ethereum blockchain activity is on the up, and the network remains the platform of choice for asset tokenization and stablecoins, the report said.  After Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the supply of ether has remained ""stagnant"" at a total of 120 million tokens, Bernstein said.  Ethereum's transaction fees deliver a yield of around 3% to stakers, which keeps about 28% of ether supply locked in staking contracts, the report noted. Another 10% of supply is locked in deposit and lending contracts.   Almost 60% of ether has not changed hands in the last 12 months which is indicative of a ""resilient investor base,"" and this reinforces the positive demand-supply dynamics for the cryptocurrency, the report added.

Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-loves-russia-trumprus-solana-memecoin-to-explode-17000-before-exchange-listing-as-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Speaking to Microsoft’s board, Saylor delivered a fast-paced, three-minute pitch supported by a 44-slide deck, laying out his vision of Bitcoin as the next major technological wave. Whether Microsoft will heed Saylor’s proposal remains to be seen, but the pitch underscores Bitcoin’s growing influence on corporate strategy discussions. Microsoft with $5 Trillion Potential Saylor’s pitch focused on the immense value he believes Bitcoin could unlock for Microsoft. He suggested the company redirect its cash flow, dividend payouts, debt, and stock buybacks into acquiring Bitcoin. By doing so, he projected Microsoft’s share price could increase by $584 over the next decade, assuming Bitcoin reaches $1.7 million per coin by 2034. The boldest claim in his presentation was that Microsoft could boost its market cap by a staggering $4.9 trillion, propelling the company far beyond its current $3.18 trillion valuation. Saylor argued that Bitcoin offers unparalleled growth potential, saying, “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next technology wave, and Bitcoin is that wave.” He further likened Bitcoin to a high-growth business available at an unbeatable valuation, stating its strategic advantage over traditional financial assets like bonds or stock buybacks. “What if you could buy a $100 billion company growing faster than Microsoft for one times revenue?” Saylor asked, underscoring Bitcoin’s perceived value. A Crypto Renaissance Saylor’s confidence in Bitcoin comes amid a surge in its value, which has climbed 120% this year to approach $100,000. His own company, MicroStrategy, has been a pioneer in corporate Bitcoin adoption , accumulating 386,700 BTC since 2020 at a cost of $21.9 billion. With Bitcoin now trading at $97,200, MicroStrategy’s holdings are worth nearly $37.6 billion, pushing its stock to new highs. The timing of Saylor’s pitch aligns with growing public and political support for cryptocurrency. He pointed to pro-crypto statements from incoming U.S. President Donald Trump and the introduction of Bitcoin investment products by leading Wall Street firms. Saylor concluded his pitch with a call to action, urging Microsoft to invest $100 billion annually in Bitcoin. “It’s time for Microsoft to evaluate its Bitcoin strategic options,” he said, emphasizing the potential benefits for shareholders and the broader financial ecosystem.

On Dec. 2, former Binance( BNB ) CEO, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao , responded to an X post by Telos Foundation’s Executive Director, John Lilic mentioning him. Lilic suggested that President-elect Donald Trump should think about pardoning CZ in light of his past criminal charges that led to him receiving a four-month prison sentence. “President @realDonaldTrump should consider a pardon for @cz_binance so he can return to being the CEO of @binance and help the crypto industry mature, and realize its full potential. He is also a victim of law fare,” said Lilic in his X post . CZ replied to Lilic’s post, clarifying that he has no desire to return to Binance as CEO. However, he did not object to receiving a pardon from Trump. “No wish to be CEO again. But definitely wouldn’t mind a pardon,” said CZ. https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1863435232768111057 You might also like: Binance’s Changpeng Zhao is $12.1b richer due to Trump victory: report Replies underneath the interaction between the Telos exec and the former Binance CEO showed a lot of support for CZ, with many users commenting “Free CZ.” Many users wrote that the former CEO would be able to do so much for the crypto community, whether it is by returning to Binance as CEO or by taking a seat in the government. “Yes CZ definitely deserves the spot in the government to bring mass #crypto adoption,” said one user. “Not working as CEO of Binance but working as a CEO of crypto,” said another user. In a public interview following his prison release, CZ debunked claims that he was under a “lifetime ban” from managing crypto exchanges via his plea agreement, He said that “those two words don’t exist in my plea agreement with the government.” However, CZ firmly said that even if he were allowed to return as Binance CEO, he has no desire to do so.

In November 2023, CZ pleaded guilty to charges related to company operations. These included facilitating transactions for countries under U.S. sanctions, such as Iran and Cuba. The charges were primarily related to money laundering. As part of his plea deal with the U.S government, Binance had to pay a fine of $4.3 billion, while Zhao personally paid a $50 million fine and agreed to step down as CEO of Binance.

37127829,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620934,1733132674,US stocks made an outstandingly historic performance in November,"November lit up Wall Street like a New Year’s Eve party, with U.S. stocks delivering some of their most remarkable gains in recent memory. The S&P 500 soared 5.73%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 7.54%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 6.21%. Both the Dow and S&P 500 hit all-time highs during Friday’s shortened trading session in a triumphant end to a month that was nothing short of historic. Small-cap stocks stole part of the spotlight, with the Russell 2000 Index skyrocketing over 10%—its biggest monthly gain of the year. Investors leaned heavily into small caps, anticipating that the Trump administration’s promised tax cuts would disproportionately benefit smaller, U.S.-focused businesses. Stocks saw big gains due to Trump’s win The markets hate uncertainty, and Donald Trump’s decisive election win provided the clarity investors craved. With the political noise out of the way, traders poured into equities, boosting all major indexes. Trump’s stock-market-friendly policies—centered on deregulation, lower taxes, and general market enthusiasm—played a massive role in driving November’s record-breaking gains. The U.S. economy was no slouch in November either. It grew at a 2.8% annualized rate in the third quarter. While the fourth quarter is projected to slow to 1.31%, according to the St. Louis Fed, even that modest growth is enough to keep the recession fears at bay. Slow growth might actually be a blessing in disguise, giving the Federal Reserve room to cut rates again during its December meeting. Inflation, meanwhile, held steady. In Europe, annual inflation in the eurozone ticked up to 2.3% from October’s 2%, a manageable number that didn’t deter investors. The pan-European Stoxx 600 Index gained 0.58% on Friday, closing November 0.96% higher. On the global stage, India’s economic data was kind of a letdown. The country reported disappointing growth numbers, with its GDP expanding by 5.4% in the fiscal quarter ending in September. That’s a steep drop from the previous quarter’s 6.7% and far below the 6.5% predicted by analysts. The Reserve Bank of India’s 7% projection now feels like a far-fetched dream. Bitcoin’s second-best month of the year November wasn’t just about traditional markets though. In fact, crypto’s king Bitcoin was the best-performing asset in what was its second-best month in 2024, skyrocketing 38%. Investors poured into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which saw their largest single-day inflows during this period. Profit-taking was offset by fresh enthusiasm, especially with the launch of options on Bitcoin ETFs. At one point, Bitcoin was literally worth over $99,700. It broke so many all-time highs, it was hard to keep count. At press time, it was hovering around $97,000, but expectations of breaking $100,000 this year are sky-high. Short sellers had a rough month. Many were forced to buy stocks and cryptos to cover their positions as the market climbed, further fueling gains. This year-end rush, combined with seasonal optimism, created a perfect storm for the markets. Stocks futures trading on Monday suggested a quieter start to December though, with Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures all dipping slightly in early morning trades. Investors are now watching for key economic data on manufacturing and construction spending, alongside labor market reports expected later in the week.

This adverse move came amid reports that large bitcoin whales have deposited significant amounts of the asset to Binance, potentially to realize some profits. However, there’s some good news as well. Whales Selling? Large crypto investors, known as whales, are fundamental to the underlying assets’ price movements due to their ability to purchase or offload substantial amounts in a short time. As such, several on-chain analytics platforms are observing many of their actions to possibly predict a notable price movement in either direction depending on whether they buy or sell. Lookonchain outlined a recent worrying move from a ‘giant’ whale that had accumulated 11,657 BTC (valued at over $780 million) from March 14 until October 31 at an average price of $66,953. With the cryptocurrency skyrocketing by about 50% from their average entry price, the anonymous whale deposited 1,000 BTC to Binance earlier today, potentially with the intention of selling and realizing some profits. A giant whale deposited 1000 $BTC ($97.5M) to #Binance in the past 4 hours!

Despite its minor bounce-off, the cryptocurrency still trades below $96,175, which popular analyst Ali outlined as a significant level that has to endure for the asset to continue its trajectory toward $100,000 and beyond. This is because over a million bitcoin addresses have accumulated more than 950,000 BTC at that average price, effectively turning it into a strong support.

Although BTC has dumped below the crucial $96,175 line, Glassnode’s Rafael said there’s still no need to panic, at least according to the relative unrealized profit metric. When it goes above 0.9, it shows when the market is overheated due to the large number of investors sitting on paper gains. Historically, such a number has resulted in immediate price corrections for the asset, as seen in the chart below. Currently, though, the metric is at 0.74, which is under the overheated levels seen in previous cycles. Consequently, Rafael concluded that “there’s room to run.” The relative unrealized profit of #bitcoin long-term holders currently sitting at 0.74, well below the overheated levels seen in previous cycles—there’s room to run.

To be more specific, the veterans are back as the primitive tokens like XRP, AVAX, LTC, ALGO, HBAR, etc. and many more with experience of the 2021 bull run and gaining more attention. It happened soon after the Bitcoin price entered relaxing mode after an attempt to breach the much-awaited target of $100K. The most important reason behind the sluggish behaviour is the drop in volume from the highs above $150 billion to the current levels below $50 billion. This shift in the volume to other altcoins could have weakened the rally, which again faced a failed attempt to reach $100K and dropped below $95,000. What’s next? What’s the Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction for December 2024? As the Bitcoin price struggles, the fear and greed index just dropped below 80, suggesting the trader’s sentiments have just shifted from extreme greed to greed. However, the downfall does not appear to have reached its destiny yet, as more longs await to liquidate soon. The liquidation heatmap from Coinglass suggests the price faced a long liquidation barrier between $98,065 and $98,257 where nearly $500 million in longs were liquidated. Although the shorts placed at $96,336 offered a small rebound, it was not enough to keep up the rally, which fell weak at $97,000. As a result, the price is juggling in and out of $95,300, which has over $130 million in accumulated liquidity. So what’s next? Considering the heatmap, the next possible level to look at is $95,657, which could break the bearish narrative; else, $94,500, which may weaken the bulls even more. However, considering the current trade set, a rebound appears to be fast approaching. The short-term price action suggests the token broke out of the rising parallel channel intending to reach the $100 milestone. Unfortunately, it attracted an 8.38% pullback, which further activated the bulls. Presently, the BTC price is testing the lower support of the channel, but this may certainly not be treated as the start of a bearish cycle. Previously, when the bulls failed to hold $92,500, a drop close to $90,000. initiated a strong rebound. Hence, if the price fails to hold the support, a small bearish pullback to $94,500 could attract huge liquidity, reviving a rise to levels above $98,000. The stochastic RSI, which has dropped to the oversold range, is preparing for a rebound. With this, the bullish momentum could be re-instigated, reviving a rise back to $98,000, which has become more rigid, and a breakout with massive buying pressure could lead the rally to $100K. Until then, the Bitcoin (BTC) price could continue to juggle below the milestone while defending the support first at $95,500 and later at $91,500.",NEGATIVE,ALGO | AVAX | BTC,ALGO | ALTCOIN | AVAX | BTC | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-looks-weak-after-failed-attempt-to-clinch-100k-a-deeper-pullback-to-90000-could-be-fast-approaching/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Crypto Analyst Warns Of Sudden Sell Signal,"After staging a massive rally, the Dogecoin price is currently in a consolidation phase. And this is also reflected in the technical indicators. Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) is warning of a potential sell indicator. In his latest update on X, Kevin shared a weekly DOGE/USDT chart and outlined technical signs that traders should monitor closely. Dogecoin Price Analysis Kevin highlighted that Dogecoin is “printing a sell signal on the weekly time frame with the red dot appearing,” cautioning that this signal requires confirmation over the next week to solidify its validity. He identified a convergence of three strong technical indicators, including a declining Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and a Stochastic Relative Strength Index (Stoch RSI) that has “topped out waiting for a bear cross.” These indicators collectively suggest that a potential downside may be imminent. However, Kevin balanced this with the observation that “price action still looks bullish and money flow is also bullish,” indicating that these factors currently outweigh the bearish signals. Despite the long-term sell signals, Kevin remains open to the possibility of continued bullish momentum in the short term. He noted that Dogecoin has “close[d] its highest monthly candle body close of all time,” marking a significant milestone while acknowledging that “downside is still a risk.” Looking ahead, Kevin pointed to the importance of a key resistance level, stating, “Until we break $0.60 cents cleanly then there’s nothing to really be excited about,” in reference to his weekly chart that includes Fibonacci price levels extending to $1. Moreover, Kevin is closely looking at macroeconomic factors that could influence Dogecoin’s performance. He indicated that an “ altcoin season ” could serve as a catalyst for DOGE’s continued strength, contingent upon Bitcoin’s dominance falling below the 55% level. “If BTC Dominance breaks the 55% level cleanly you will get your #ALTSEASON folks,” he explained. Additionally, Kevin shared his strategy regarding long-term moving averages, stating, “When these two long term moving averages cross on Dogecoin I will be selling a large piece of my bag. They have called the top successfully on DOGE multiple times. They are moving up fast!” Notably, the crypto analyst is referring to the Pi Cycle Top Indicator for Dogecoin, a tool traditionally used for Bitcoin (BTC). This indicator relies on the crossing of two moving averages—the 111-day and the 350-day multiplied by two—to signal potential market peaks. Last week, Kevin revealed, “One of my secret indicators for Dogecoin that is traditionally only supposed to work for BTC is the Pi Cycle tops indicator. It has accurately called every DOGE cycle top and bottom over each of its cycles. When the two moving averages cross along with Monthly RSI being at a certain level that’s when I plan on taking significant portions out of the market.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.41.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-boom-over-crypto-analyst-sudden-sell-signal/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

And luckily we didn't sell the Solana at $13, and it went up to $240.” Mark Yusko also concluded his remarks by talking about DOGE and said that not owning the best memecoin Dogecoin is like betting against Elon Musk and that it is not a good idea, and that it is necessary to have at least a little DOGE. The famous CEO finally said that ADA, XRP and HBAR should also be invested in, even though he thinks they are risky. Yusko argued that such cryptocurrencies could be adopted by more traditional financial companies in the coming years. *This is not investment advice.

BTC pairs’ declining volume signals a shift in crypto market dynamics since 2022. Fiat pairs retain relevance in rallies but cede dominance to stablecoins in trading. The altcoin market is undergoing a dramatic shift, with trading patterns and market structure evolving rapidly. Data and insights from CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju show that the traditional idea of an “altcoin season,”—where capital rotates from Bitcoin into altcoins—is outdated. Alt season is no longer defined by asset rotation from #Bitcoin . The surge in altcoin trading volume isn’t driven by $BTC pairs but by stablecoin and fiat pairs, reflecting real market growth rather than asset rotation.

This development, which will distribute portions of the Wise Monkey (MONKY) supply, is part of a collaborative effort involving Floki, the Ape Accelerator, and other notable blockchain entities to introduce new energy to the crypto ecosystem. According to Binance’s announcement , the airdrop will use wallet snapshots to determine eligibility. For holders of ApeCoin ( APE ), the snapshot occurred on Nov. 29 at 00:00 UTC. Meanwhile, Floki ( FLOKI ) holders will have their snapshot on Dec. 15, at 00:00 UTC. Binance confirmed that the distribution will follow a specific ratio. Particularly, for every 1 FLOKI held, a market participant will receive 0.35 MONKY, while each 1 APE token will equal 804,828 MONKY. To qualify for the airdrop, users must hold at least 1 FLOKI or 1 APE. Any balances below this threshold, including those in trade, withdrawals or deposits at the time of the snapshot, are excluded. You might also like: Coinbase exec sees stablecoin rules becoming clear in 2025 The exchange stressed that eligible balances include holdings in Binance funding and spot wallets, as well as certain flexible accounts like Simple Earn. However, liabilities in margin accounts and borrowed tokens are ineligible. Wise Monkey airdrop The Wise Monkey token gets its inspiration from the proverb “See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil.” The meme coin will launch on the Binance Smart Chain later this month. FLOKI and APE holders stand to receive portions of the supply. The project plans to allocate 35% of the supply to the Floki community, with 27% set to be airdropped to holdings on supported centralized exchanges and on-chain holdings. Meanwhile, 10% of the supply will go to APE holders. Binance’s recent support comes on the back of a similar move from OKX, Uphold and KuCoin. While the MONKY token distribution is confirmed, its listing on Binance for trading is subject to the platform’s rigorous review process, and no guarantees have been made.

China ‘s central bank digital currency — also known as the digital yuan — is still encountering “bottlenecks” in user adoption, driven by reluctance and competition from platforms like Alipay, says Charles Chang, director of the Fintech Research Centre at Fudan University in Shanghai. Despite the digital yuan’s potential, popular online payment services such as Alipay and WeChat Pay have entrenched user bases, making it difficult to persuade consumers to switch to a new option, Chang told the South China Morning Post in a Dec. 1 interview .

37126870,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373009,1733130855,3 Possible Reasons Behind XRP’s 350% Monthly Surge to $2.5,"TL:DR; XRP has gone on a tear in the past month, surging by about 350% and reaching a multi-year peak of nearly $2.5. Here are some of the possible reasons behind this mindblowing rally that made Ripple’s token the third-largest earlier today. Whale Accumulation It’s safe to say that Ripple’s native cross-border token has stolen the show after the US presidential elections. Despite its sluggish start, XRP went on a roll that pushed its price from about $0.6 to $2.5 earlier today, which became its highest level since January 2018. Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of the company behind the asset, explained earlier that US-based crypto companies have benefited the most from Trump’s victory due to the Democrats’ hostile stance against the industry. This theory has only been proven right since then, with XRP charting nothing but impressive gains. Within this past month or so, whales have been particularly active in accumulating the token. Their cumulative stash tapped a 6-year high recently amid reports that they have been buying from retail investors who rushed to secure profits. More recent data from Santiment revealed that large XRP wallets holding between 1M and 10M had purchased over 679 million coins in just three weeks. Additionally, non-empty addresses have gone above 5.5 million for the first time ever. Both of these are highly bullish factors for the underlying asset. XRP has skyrocketed to an astounding $2.49 market value for the first time since January 8, 2018. The 6-year (nearly 7-year) high comes as wallets with 1M-10M XRP have accumulated 679.1M tokens (currently worth $1.66B) in just 3 weeks. Also, total non-empty XRP wallets have… pic.twitter.com/bIsfOqdCQX — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 2, 2024 Upcoming Stablecoin Launch Amid its four-year-long legal tussle against the US SEC, Ripple announced plans earlier this year to launch a stablecoin, which will be pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. This upcoming entrance in the multi-billion dollar stablecoin industry depends on the regulatory landscape in the US, which is expected to change a lot under Trump’s administration. According to FoxBusiness, the watchdog responsible for approving or rejecting the RLUSD applications – the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), has “indicated to Ripple it will approve the product” soon. In fact, the company is reportedly planning to launch it as early as December 4. The growing hype around the potential release of the product comes as the second potential reason behind XRP’s surge. Regulatory Change The third reason has been mentioned quite a lot since November 5 – the upcoming regulatory changes in the US, but cannot be overstated due to its significance. After all, Ripple and many other crypto companies were in the crosshairs of the SEC and other US watchdogs for years during Biden’s reign. With Trump making so many pro-crypto promises during his campaign and Gary Gensler already announcing his departure from the agency on January 20, the hype is real when it comes down to a more favorable environment for crypto businesses to thrive in the world’s largest economy. More than $1.3 billion entered the crypto markets since the elections, and XRP, which many believed was suppressed during Gensler’s time at the SEC, is finally breaking out.

At 4 am UTC on Dec. 1, an attacker manipulated Clipper’s withdrawal function, exploiting its ability to process bundled swap and withdrawal transactions, the protocol wrote in its first post-incident report. The lost funds from liquidity pools on Optimism and Base accounted for roughly 6% of the total value locked in the platform, compelling it to suspend swaps and deposits on all chains and disable the ability to withdraw in the form of just one token. “Withdrawals are still available because Clipper is noncustodial and can never prevent you from withdrawing. However, any withdrawals must be in the mix of all assets in the pool,” Clipper Dex wrote. An initial investigation from Chaofan Shou, co-founder of security firm Fuzzland, suggested that the exploit stemmed from a private key leak, enabling the attacker to sign deposit and withdrawal requests to extract funds. However, Clipper has debunked these claims, stressing that its security architecture is designed to prevent such vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, Clipper reassured its community that all remaining funds are secure, promising regular updates as it continues its investigation. The team is also actively tracing the stolen assets and has invited the attacker to engage in dialogue.

37126839,https://coinpedia.org/?p=387939,1733130677,From Bottom to Breakout: Is Shiba Inu Ready for a Massive Rally?,"The post From Bottom to Breakout: Is Shiba Inu Ready for a Massive Rally? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The famous meme coin Shiba Inu might be getting ready to break its previous all-time high. The movements on charts are spreading excitement among the Shib Army. At the end of October 2021, as the crypto market was about to take a dip, the dog-themed meme coin started its downward journey. From a peak of $0.00008854, it touched the bottom at $0.00000543 in June 2023. What are the symptoms that point towards an uprising? Let’s discuss. Historical Price Patterns of Shiba Inu Before we dive into the current conditions, let’s have a look at the past. As Niccolò Machiavelli said, “Whoever wishes to foresee the future must consult the past.” Since June 2022, SHIB has been moving mostly in a confined zone between $0.00000731 and $0.00001320. The memecoin finally broke out of this range in February 2024. The price has been following the support and resistance levels indicated by the Fibonacci retracement perfectly. In the last week of February 2024, SHIB surged by 371.98% to reach $0.00003564, however, it could not hold this position for long. Facing rejection from the 0.618 level of Fib at $0.00003429, the token started another down movement. From March to November 2024, Shiba Inu moved in a symmetrical triangle only to receive an upside breakout during the US election. Current Technical Analysis and Key Levels Currently, on a daily chart, we can see the movement is perfectly aligning with Fib levels, and the current support is at $0.00002553, with an ongoing resistance at $0.00003429. The RSI looks solid at 67.40, giving huge space for the price rise, and ADX at 41.94 supports the move. However, if we talk about the balance of power, it is currently at -0.55, which means bulls are taking a break before pushing the price further up. The 200 moving average has been crossed over by 20, 50, and 100 MA, and the 20 daily moving average lies exactly at the 0.5 support level of Fib. This shows that this is a very solid support zone now, and as the whole crypto market is in bullish sentiment, there are next to zero chances that this will be broken. The token is witnessing a 37.16% surge in the daily trading volume, which is at $6.11 billion at the time of writing. Investor Sentiments and On-Chain Metrics According to data by IntoTheBloc, 74% of Shiba investors are in profit at the current price of $0.00002950. Seven percent of investors bought at the current price range, leaving 19% in the loss. Since the launch of the Shiba Inu blockchain Shibarium, the total value locked in it is on the rise, with a few small bumps. Currently, the TVL is $5.57M. It was in decline from March 2024 till November, then it gained a huge spike. Approximately 41.07% of the total supply has been burned, supporting the rise of price. Shiba Inu Ecosystem: Expanding Horizons There are a number of projects that are built on Shiba Inu, which are contributing to its mass adoption and transactions. With every transaction, some amount of the fee is burned. These projects include a decentralized exchange called ShibaSwap, a collectible card game named Shiba Eternity, Shiboshis (a collection of 10,000 NFTs), and ShibaSwag. The SHIB ecosystem has other currencies like Leash and Bone. A new project, “Treat,” is coming to the ecosystem soon. There are many other projects on their way to support the Shiba Inu ecosystem.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE.

WIF, SOL, ALGO, and THETA prepare for the crypto market’s next move. Analysts predict $250,000 BTC in the next 12 months. Ripple’s token, XRP, surged to $2.5 early Monday, overtaking BNB and Solana to secure the third position among cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap. The rally aligns with growing market optimism and significant adoption moves by governments and institutions driving demand for digital assets. In a podcast , the Altcoin Daily presenter highlighted Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to sign legislation recognizing cryptocurrency as property. This move exempts Bitcoin mining and sales from VAT, positioning Russia ahead of the U.S. in crypto-friendly policies. Meanwhile, the incoming U.S. president has pledged to make the country the global crypto hub, with plans to implement supportive measures. Considering the recent developments, many crypto analysts are reviewing their Bitcoin price predictions, with most increasing their targets to between $225,000 and $250,000 BTC in 2025.

37126911,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51153,1733129469,Analyst Sets Double-Digits XRP Price Between $20 and $27,"EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, recently released a compelling chart and analysis regarding the future of XRP, asserting that the asset could soon achieve double-digit price levels. This forecast hinges on historical trends, market dynamics, and a potential surge in buying momentum as XRP crossed the critical $2 resistance level. #XRP – The BIG FALL ($20-$27) Just 40 days ago, on October 20th, 2024, skepticism was everywhere! Check the post here: pic.twitter.com/Cab7ufvYmi The Big Fall IS Happening! If we close above $2, FOMO will ignite ! And if history repeats with a similar percentage… https://t.co/Viu2FzD7p5 pic.twitter.com/na9Ejog9gJ — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) November 30, 2024 XRP Above $2 and FOMO Potential According to EGRAG CRYPTO, XRP’s ability to break above $2 would catalyze significant market activity. This key price level is expected to trigger Fear of Missing Out (FOMO), leading to heightened trading volume and a substantial upward price movement. The analyst suggests that once this level is breached, XRP could rapidly rise to between $20 and $27. EGRAG CRYPTO presented a unique chart that seems to depict XRP falling. However, a closer look reveals that the chart is flipped, and the analyst expects a massive upward move for the digital asset. The chart EGRAG CRYPTO highlights parallels between XRP’s historical price behavior and the current market setup. Specifically, the analyst draws attention to previous percentage increases, suggesting that if XRP follows a similar trajectory, the double-digit price range is a realistic possibility. Historical performance often provides critical insights into the future movements of assets, and EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis leverages this principle effectively. Meanwhile, another notable expert recently predicted an XRP surge to $22 to surpass Ethereum, similar to EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis and prediction. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Areas of Focus EGARAG CRYPTO divides the XRP price chart into distinct zones. Area A and Area B represent pivotal ranges where price action has historically concentrated. The chart emphasizes XRP’s journey from its current range to its anticipated climb, showcasing the importance of breaking through resistance levels. A critical observation in the analysis is the magnitude of past gains, with some percentage increases, like the final push toward its all-time high in January 2018, exceeding 1,000%. The extrapolation of these patterns forms the basis for the ambitious $20-$27 target. EGRAG CRYPTO’s prediction that XRP could reach $20 to $27 soon has renewed optimism among many in the cryptocurrency community. As XRP recently breached the analyst’s critical resistance level ($2), FOMO is expected to drive momentum for higher prices in the coming weeks and months. If XRP closes above $2 and FOMO-driven momentum takes hold, the analyst’s ambitious price targets may materialize. EGRAG CRYPTO has called the $27 target multiple times, and it’s only a matter of time before the asset achieves this.

37126193,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98220,1733129186,Ripple’s XRP Successfully Flips Tether To Become World’s Third-Biggest Crypto Amid Parabolic Surge; Is ETH Next?,"XRP continued its barnstorming price rally on Sunday, rocketing by around 30%. According to CoinGecko data, the coin has reached a new multi-year high of $2.48. The Ripple-promoted crypto now holds the third spot in terms of market capitalization, surpassing stablecoin giant Tether (USDT) and “Ethereum killer” Solana (SOL). XRP’s latest rally has seen it become the cynosure of all eyes within the crypto space and has sparked questions about whether it’s about to take on Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. XRP Tops $2 Following Blistering Rally XRP started surging alongside other major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Solana (SOL), following Republican Donald Trump’s election win on Nov. 5. However, the Ripple-affiliated has begun outperforming other crypto peers. XRP’s outsized price performance has helped it reclaim the top three spot after coming close to dropping out of the top 10 following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s protracted lawsuit against Ripple. XRP’s rally comes amid growing optimism over its regulatory future. President-elect Trump made a slew of pro-crypto promises on the campaign trail, and SEC chair Gary Gensler is set to resign effective January 20, 2025, when Trump will be inaugurated. The SEC has targeted Ripple for alleged securities violations, leaving XRP with an uncertain future in the United States. However, the forthcoming regime change has given investors confidence that the token will face fewer regulatory challenges going forward and could gain traction for spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other financial applications. XRP was trading hands for $2.43 as of press time. It’s still roughly 28.4% away from its lifetime peak of $3.40 registered back in January 2018, but again, it’s closer than it has been in almost seven years. Is XRP Coming To Oust Ether? With its current market cap of $138.6 billion, XRP now trails only Bitcoin and Ethereum in the crypto asset rankings. Still, the third-largest crypto has a long way to go to overtake Ether, which currently boasts a market cap of $440 billion. However, crypto influencer Ben “BitBoy” Armstrong recently reiterated his belief that XRP will surpass Ethereum in market value during this bull cycle. “$ETH you can run, but you can’t hide!” BitBoy wrote in a Friday post on X. Meanwhile, a top analyst has noted that XRP may be witnessing a “leverage-driven” pump as its price soars. CryptoQuant strategist Maarten Regterschot warned in a Nov. 1 post that open interest in XRP has jumped massively and could result in a sharp sell-off. “Open Interest is up 37% already — watch for volatility. The last similar event led to a -17% drawdown,” said Maarten. “Stay sharp, manage risk accordingly.”",POSITIVE,ETH | USDT | XRP,ETH | MARKET | TRADING | USDT | XRP,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ripples-xrp-successfully-flips-tether-to-become-worlds-third-biggest-crypto-amid-parabolic-surge-is-eth-next/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png
37128897,https://invezz.com/?p=2322131,1733129043,"Ethereum price prediction: ETH set to rocket toward $4500 as it builds momentum against Bitcoin, top trending DeFi altcoin to reach $20","Ethereum (ETH) is gaining momentum against Bitcoin, with analysts predicting a surge toward $4,500 as it solidifies its position as the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance (RXS), a rising DeFi star, is trending as one of the top altcoins with immense growth potential. Currently, in its 8th presale stage at $0.1, RXS has already raised over $17.67M and is expected to skyrocket to $20 following its listing on tier 1 exchanges. Backed by a Certik audit and targeting leadership over Shiba Inu by 2025, RXS is capturing the attention of savvy investors. Ethereum price prediction The daily Ethereum price chart shows a clear sell signal that hints at an incoming correction. This sell signal is in the form of a bearish divergence noted between the price and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). A bearish divergence is formed when the price produces a higher high while the RSI produces lower highs, denoting a lack of momentum backing up the up-trending price. The result of this non-conformity is a correction. Considering that Ethereum’s price currently faces both the declining trend line and horizontal resistance level as a blockade, a short-term correction is likely. If Bitcoin drops, ETH could follow suit and trigger a 17% crash to $2,886. This key support level is a good place for accumulation before Ether triggers its next leg up. The following bounce from $2,886 needs to overcome the $3,500 hurdle to climb to $4,000, a key psychological level. On the other hand, if Bitcoin’s price fails to drop lower and trigger a reversal, then ETH will look stronger than other altcoins. It could break above $3,500 and preemptively catalyze a run to $4,000. This move will invalidate the short-term correction thesis.

The token’s meteoric rise comes after years of price stagnation and legal battles. Moreover, crypto lawyer Bill Morgan recently claimed that the SEC’s appeal in the Ripple-SEC case would be dropped . This also added to positive sentiment, reigniting hopes among its dedicated community, the XRP Army. A Meteoric Comeback XRP surged above $2 on Sunday night, pushing its market capitalization to over $140 billion and surpassing USDT’s $134 billion. This marks the first time XRP has approached its 2018 all-time high of $3.40 in over five years. Fueling this rally was a combination of legal developments and technical momentum. Charles Gasparino of Fox Business hinted last week that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might drop its appeal against Ripple Labs, the largest holder of XRP. Gasparino suggested the SEC’s case had no errors on the disputed points it lost, rather than being politically motivated. Technical indicators added to the excitement. Barchart highlighted the formation of a “God Candle” on XRP’s price chart, signaling strong bullish momentum. Over the past week, the token has spiked more than 80%, with a 30% gain in the last 24 hours alone. This surge has sparked renewed optimism, with some speculating XRP might soon challenge Ethereum (ETH) for the second spot in crypto rankings. Vindication for XRP Army XRP’s return to prominence feels like redemption for its loyal supporters, who endured years of price suppression following the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple in late 2020. The legal uncertainty had driven XRP below $1, stalling its progress and tarnishing its once-strong reputation as a Bitcoin challenger. With the lawsuit now leaning in Ripple’s favor, the token’s resurgence has revitalized its community. Social media platform X (formerly Twitter) was abuzz with celebratory memes and messages from holders, many of whom proudly declared their steadfast belief in the XRP Ledger’s potential. “The $XRP train has left the station,” exclaimed one holder, Edward Farina, encapsulating the euphoria among supporters. Analysts like Jacob King have doubled down on XRP’s future, calling it “the only cryptocurrency with a feasible chance of surpassing Bitcoin.” As the token trends across financial media, its comeback not only underscores its resilience but also hints at its ambition to once again be a dominant force in the crypto world.

Data from CoinMarketCap reveals that XRP’s capitalization has surged past $1350 billion, leaving only Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ahead in the rankings. Over the past seven days, XRP has increased by almost 70%, pushing its price near $2.5, a level not seen almost seven years ago. What’s Powering XRP’s Rally? The XRP rally can be traced to a series of political and regulatory developments alongside renewed market speculation. Donald Trump’s election as the 47th President of the United States has reignited enthusiasm across the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin approaching the $100,000 mark and Ethereum posting notable gains. XRP, initially showing moderate activity in November, has gained momentum following reports that Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin is on track for approval by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and may launch as early as December 4. Furthermore, there’s also growing speculation about a potential end to Ripple’s legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is fueling bullish sentiment. Investor confidence has been further strengthened by SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation and the expectation that a Trump-led administration will adopt a more favorable stance toward the industry. Other developments include firms like Bitwise and Canary Capital, which are actively pursuing the SEC’s approval to introduce ETFs focused on XRP. Drawdown Ahead? According to CryptoQuant analyst Maarten Regterschot, XRP is currently experiencing a leverage-driven price surge, with Open Interest (OI) climbing by 37%. This uptick in leverage suggests that traders are aggressively positioning for price movements, which could amplify volatility in the short term. The analyst cautioned that a similar pattern in the past led to a 17% price decline, emphasizing the importance of managing risk amid such conditions. Currently, XRP’s open interest climbed to $4.23 billion across major trading platforms, as per data compiled by CoinGlass.

Hedera ( HBAR ) rose 47% over the past day, exchanging hands at a seven-month high of $0.253 before shedding some of its gains and settling at $0.250 at press time. The altcoin’s recent rally extended its monthly gains to over 450% while its market cap stood at $9.65 billion. Rumours are driving the HBAR rally HBAR’s rally has been driven by its growing involvement in blockchain-powered federal payment systems. Hedera’s integration with the Federal Reserve’s FedNow payment network, facilitated by Dropp, enables real-time, secure, and efficient transactions. Speculation has also emerged around Ripple’s potential involvement, with rumors suggesting an expansion of Hedera’s integration to include support for Ripple’s upcoming RLUSD stablecoin . If true, this could pave the way for an interoperability layer between HBAR and XRP, furthering their collaboration on global standards for CBDC and stablecoin settlements. Further, HBAR traders are optimistic due to speculation surrounding the potential approval of a Hedera-focused exchange-traded fund filed by Canary Capital with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. With Gary Gensler stepping down as SEC chairman, a potential approval under Trump’s administration seems plausible. This could open the door for greater institutional investment, potentially driving further price growth for HBAR. Rumors and recent developments appear to be driving heightened activity among whales. Data from HederaWatch highlights a sharp increase in accounts holding between 100,000 and 100 million HBAR, with those holding 100 million surging by over 20% since August. You might also like: Hedera’s HBAR momentum has just began, analyst says HBAR’s price surge has been matched by a notable jump in trading activity and open interest. Within the last 24 hours, trading volume skyrocketed by 323% to $3.46 billion, while open interest climbed 76% to $324 million . The uptick indicates an influx of fresh capital into the market, potentially providing the momentum needed for continued price growth.

HBAR Bollinger Bands and RSI chart — Dec. 2 | Source: crypto.news At the same time, the Relative Strength Index has hit 83, showing strong buying activity and confirming the bullish trend. However, an RSI above 70 typically signals that an asset is in overbought territory. This means HBAR might be due for a cooldown or a price pullback if the current momentum starts to slow down. In case of a price reversal, the altcoin could find support at $0.1358, aligning with the middle Bollinger Band—a level previously tested as support during its drop on Nov. 25.

XRP, the payments-focused cryptocurrency, has skyrocketed 375% to $2.40 in 30 days. The price has surged more than 20% in the past 24 hours alone, CoinDesk data show.  The meteoric rise has lifted the cryptocurrency's market capitalization to $139 billion, replacing the leading dollar-pegged stablecoin, Tether's USDT, as the world's third-largest digital asset.  ""This [XRP] comeback is making waves across the market, potentially signalling the return of retail traders and investors to the crypto market,"" Mena Theodorou, co-founder of the crypto exchange Coinstash, said in an email. ""Recent XRP trends on TikTok, speculation about the approval of a Ripple-issued stablecoin, and the possibility of an ETF are likely fueling the fire and driving renewed interest in XRP.""   XRP's trading volumes have surged globally. Upbit, South Korea's biggest crypto exchange, registered a record $4 billion volume in the XRP-won pair in the past 24 hours. That's over 27% of the exchange's total trading volume, according to data source Coingecko.  The record activity in the XRP market comes as South Korea's Democratic Party, on Sunday, backtracked on a plan to impose crypto capital gains tax in 2025, delaying it by two years.  ""Originally planned for 2021, the tax has now been postponed multiple times,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note to clients Monday. ""This delay is critical, as it effectively removes a major obstacle to speculative trading, giving the green light for another wave of aggressive crypto speculation.""   BTC's sell wall  Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, started the new week on a weak note, dropping 1% to $96,000. Prices have remained locked between $90,000 and $100,000 for the past two weeks, with upward momentum consistently faltering near the elusive six-digit mark.  Continued appreciation warrants bullish flows strong enough to chew through a stack of sell orders worth $384 million, according to Valentin Fournier, an analyst at BRN.  ""Despite strong market catalysts and growing investor confidence, Bitcoin continues to struggle with the $100K psychological barrier. Profit-taking is evident, and a substantial sell wall of over 4,000 BTC must be cleared before higher levels are achievable,"" Fournier told CoinDesk in an email.  Moreover, traders are increasingly rotating money out of bitcoin and into other cryptocurrencies. That's evident from the decline in BTC's dominance rate, or share of the crypto market, from 61.5% to 56.5% since Nov. 21.  ""Bitcoin dominance has dropped by 5% over the past 12 days, breaking below the positive trendline established in June 2023. With significant resistance at $100K, the market is seeing a capital shift towards altcoins, supported by increasing liquidity,"" Fournier said.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT | XRP,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | USDT | XRP,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/02/xrp-replaces-tether-as-3rd-largest-cryptocurrency-while-btc-faces-384-m-sell-wall,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/796f71b2ac04cfc94510b822f64a0da05a6cd74c-2780x1150.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

More Uptrends on the Way!","The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) reached the $100,000 mark in its rise that started after Donald Trump's victory. However, BTC, which failed to surpass this critical level, experienced a pullback to $90,000 levels last week. BTC recovered after this decline and rose to $96,000 levels again. While almost the entire market expects Bitcoin to surpass $100,000 before the end of 2024, 10X Research founder Markus Thielen predicted that the price could rise even higher. Thielen said that Bitcoin exchange balances have reached historic lows, indicating further upward pressure on the price. Markus Thielen noted in a recent report that Bitcoin balances have reached historic lows. “This shows that BTC and the crypto market are expected to start growing continuously next year,” Thilen said. According to the report, long-term investors are holding on tightly to their BTC positions, which restricts the flow of BTC to exchanges and reduces liquidity. The analyst said that only three major crypto exchanges, including Bitfinex, Binance, and Coinbase, currently indicate that they have sufficient BTC reserves to meet buyer demand, but in contrast, smaller exchanges are having more difficulty maintaining liquidity. “Furthermore, the recent decline in BTC exchange balances has coincided with increased institutional interest in Bitcoin-related financial products such as spot Bitcoin ETFs. This increasing demand from both retail and institutional investors and the reduction of exchange balances could lead to higher upward price pressure.” *This is not investment advice.

37125933,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620846,1733128380,Crypto Experts Highlight 3 Tokens Poised to Outpace Ripple by 2025,"Ripple (XRP) has been a dominant force in the crypto world, known for revolutionizing cross-border payments. However, as the blockchain space continues to evolve, new projects with innovative technologies and strong ecosystems are emerging as serious contenders. Crypto experts are pointing to three standout tokens— Lightchain AI , Just a Chill Guy , and Solana —as the ones most likely to outpace Ripple by 2025. 1. Lightchain AI: The Next-Gen Blockchain Powerhouse At the top of the list is Lightchain AI , a blockchain project that is redefining the possibilities of decentralized technology. By integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain through its unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, Lightchain AI is setting new benchmarks for scalability, utility, and eco-friendliness. Why Lightchain AI Could Surpass Ripple: AI-Powered Blockchain: The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) allows developers to execute AI-specific tasks like predictive analytics and machine learning directly on the blockchain. Real-World Applications: From fraud detection in finance to healthcare diagnostics, Lightchain AI offers solutions that go far beyond payments. Presale Potential: Currently in its presale phase, Lightchain AI is priced under $0.10, offering early investors the chance to capitalize on its explosive growth potential. Meme Coin Pump Pad: Lightchain AI isn’t just about enterprise solutions—it’s creating a platform for meme coins to launch and thrive, capturing the speculative energy of the market. With its ability to revolutionize both blockchain and AI, Lightchain AI is a project that’s not just poised to outpace Ripple—it’s redefining what’s possible in the crypto space. 2. Just a Chill Guy: The Meme Coin With Staying Power Meme coins have proven they’re more than just a passing trend, and Just a Chill Guy is leading the charge in the next wave of viral tokens. Combining humor with a loyal community, Just a Chill Guy brings a fresh approach to the meme coin category. Why Just a Chill Guy Is a Contender: Community-Driven Growth: Meme coins thrive on social media buzz, and Just a Chill Guy’s fans are creating viral moments that keep the token in the spotlight. Deflationary Tokenomics: Built-in scarcity mechanisms increase value as the token gains adoption. Broad Appeal: Just a Chill Guy appeals to both retail investors seeking fun and whales looking for high-risk, high-reward plays. While Ripple focuses on enterprise-level solutions, Just a Chill Guy captures the excitement and unpredictability of meme coin mania, making it a unique and dynamic investment. 3. Solana: The High-Performance Blockchain Veteran Solana has long been celebrated as a blockchain capable of handling thousands of transactions per second with low fees and high scalability. While Ripple has carved out a niche in payments, Solana’s versatility makes it a strong competitor across DeFi, NFTs, and more. Why Solana Could Outpace Ripple: Technical Excellence: Solana’s proof-of-history (PoH) consensus mechanism ensures lightning-fast transaction speeds and unparalleled scalability. Developer Ecosystem: A thriving community of developers is building innovative projects on Solana’s platform, from DeFi protocols to NFT marketplaces. Institutional Adoption: Partnerships with major enterprises further solidify its credibility and utility. Solana’s ability to scale and adapt positions it as a blockchain leader for years to come, with the potential to surpass Ripple in market dominance. The Case for These Three Tokens While Ripple has long been a staple of the crypto market, the landscape is changing rapidly. Lightchain AI , with its groundbreaking AI integration and early-stage investment opportunity, stands out as a frontrunner for explosive growth. Meanwhile, Just a Chill Guy brings a unique twist to meme coins, and Solana offers the technical prowess and scalability that keep it ahead of the competition. Don’t Miss Your Chance to Join the Revolution For investors looking to diversify their portfolios with tokens poised for significant growth, these three projects offer unique opportunities.

With countless investment opportunities in the blockchain space, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. While well-known names like Tron and Cronos continue to evolve, a rising star, Qubetics, is capturing attention with its presale that started at just $0.01 and is now priced at $0.025 in its 10th stage. Qubetics ($TICS) is unlike any other project. With its focus on solving real-world problems through innovative blockchain applications like asset tokenization and Web3 aggregation, it offers an opportunity for both individuals and businesses to benefit. Its presale performance is setting new benchmarks, promising high returns for early investors. Let’s dive into how Qubetics compares to Tron and Cronos in terms of potential and innovation. Qubetics Is Empowering Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics has introduced a tokenized asset marketplace that’s transforming how people invest in and trade physical and digital assets. By breaking down traditionally expensive investments like real estate, intellectual property, and commodities into digital tokens, Qubetics democratises access to markets that were previously out of reach for everyday people. Think about this: a small business owner can now raise funds by tokenising their factory equipment, attracting global investors. Artists can monetize their intellectual property by selling shares of their creations. Even a landlord can tokenize their rental properties, unlocking liquidity while maintaining ownership. Qubetics caters to diverse needs, making it a platform for anyone looking to unlock value from their assets. Unmatched Presale Growth and Future Returns The Qubetics presale , currently in its 10th stage, is creating a buzz for all the right reasons. Having already sold over 251 million tokens to more than 5,300 holders, it has raised an impressive $3.9 million. At $0.025 per $TICS token, investors have a limited window to get in before the price increases by 10% in the 11th stage this weekend. The potential returns are massive. Analysts predict that a $150 investment at $0.025 could grow to: $1,312 by the presale’s end at $0.25, an 871% ROI. $5,678 if $TICS hits $1 post-presale, offering a 3787% ROI. $28,998 if $TICS reaches $5, a staggering 19,337% ROI. $87,320 if $TICS achieves $15 after its mainnet launch, delivering a life-changing 58,213% ROI. For anyone looking for the best crypto presale to join in December 2024, Qubetics is the clear frontrunner. Tron Is Pushing Web3 To Mainstream Adoption Tron has long been a pioneer in Web3, aiming to decentralise the internet and bring blockchain technology into the mainstream. Its network supports millions of transactions per second, making it an ideal platform for decentralised applications and smart contracts. Tron’s high scalability and low fees have attracted developers and businesses looking for reliable blockchain solutions. One of its standout achievements is its integration with stablecoins, allowing users to transfer funds globally without relying on banks. This feature has been a game-changer for freelancers and gig workers who previously dealt with high transaction fees and delays. With its expanding ecosystem, Tron is setting the stage for a decentralised future where financial transactions are seamless and borderless. Cronos Is Redefining Decentralised Finance Cronos is carving its niche in decentralised finance (DeFi), offering a robust platform for financial applications. Its integration with Crypto.com and EVM compatibility has made it a preferred choice for developers and investors alike. The network supports low-cost, fast transactions, enabling users to lend, borrow, and stake assets without the complexities of traditional finance. Cronos also shines in terms of accessibility. With its user-friendly ecosystem, it’s empowering newcomers to explore DeFi opportunities, making it a go-to platform for those just starting out in blockchain. By bridging the gap between centralised exchanges and decentralised applications, Cronos is building a comprehensive ecosystem that caters to a wide audience. Conclusion Qubetics , Tron, and Cronos each bring unique strengths to the table, but Qubetics clearly stands out in December 2024 as the best crypto presale to join. While Tron focuses on decentralising the internet and Cronos leads in DeFi, Qubetics addresses real-world problems like asset tokenization and liquidity issues, making it a transformative platform for investors and businesses alike. With $TICS tokens priced at $0.025 in the 10th stage, the clock is ticking for anyone wanting to capitalise on this opportunity. As the price increases by 10% this weekend, early investors stand to gain incredible returns, with analysts predicting up to a 58,213% ROI long term.

37125491,https://coinpedia.org/?p=387925,1733127974,Bitcoin Price Crash in December? Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Possible Dip to $60K,"The post Bitcoin Price Crash in December? Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Possible Dip to $60K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Though the market is ultra bullish on Bitcoin’s price and many expect a Santa rally in December as post-elections Bitcoin tends to rise 30-40%. But there are possibilities of a short-term dip as well. Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the bestselling book Rich Dad Poor Dad, has recently predicted a Bitcoin’s price could “crash” to as low as $60,000. This forecast follows Bitcoin’s dramatic rise, which recently brought the cryptocurrency to a near-all-time high of $99,800. However, Kiyosaki’s warning isn’t as critical as it sounds. While he acknowledges the potential for a short-term drop, he remains bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term value. Long-Term Bullish Outlook Kiyosaki has repeatedly expressed his belief that Bitcoin, despite its volatility, is a vital hedge against economic uncertainty. He has warned that the global financial system is on shaky ground due to rising debt levels and potential currency devaluation, particularly the U.S. dollar. For Kiyosaki, Bitcoin represents a safe haven, much like gold and silver, especially as governments continue to print money. He has even made bold predictions, such as Bitcoin reaching $10 million per coin in the future due to these economic challenges. Despite his concern over a potential price drop to $60,000, Kiyosaki remains committed to Bitcoin as part of his portfolio. He sees any dip as an opportunity to buy more Bitcoin, showcasing his belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. “If and when that happens I will not sell. BTC will be having a sale. I will buy more,” he stated. Technically How low Bitcoin Can Go? With short-term correction looming on the horizon Bitcoin at present can drop towards the $60000 to $62000 range. Currently, Bitcoin is facing resistance at about $99,100, a key level that’s preventing it from going higher. On top of that, Bitcoin’s RSI (a tool that measures how much the price has moved) is over 74, which suggests that Bitcoin might be overbought. In the past, whenever the RSI reached similar levels, Bitcoin’s price usually dropped after a strong rally. When Bitcoin corrects, it often finds support at its 50-week moving average (EMA), which is a kind of average price over the last year. In previous rallies, like in 2021, Bitcoin hit highs and then pulled back to the 50-week EMA before continuing. This pattern suggests that Bitcoin might drop to the $62,000 mark, where it could find support and potentially stabilize before moving higher again. Other Analysts Share Optimism While price correction is prominent and considered normal, other analysts are more optimistic about Bitcoin’s future. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, does not foresee Bitcoin dropping below $80,000. He believes Bitcoin is in a strong position and will continue to climb in the coming months. Some analysts even predict Bitcoin could hit $150,000, with increasing institutional interest and liquidity driving the market forward. Raoul Pal, CEO of Global Macro Investor, also shares a bullish outlook. He has suggested that Bitcoin could surge past $110,000 by January 2025, fueled by global liquidity injections from central banks.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-crash-in-december-robert-kiyosaki-predicts-possible-dip-to-60k/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Tron is advancing decentralised applications, while Toncoin integrates blockchain technology into messaging platforms. These projects are reshaping their respective sectors and offering unique opportunities for investors. However, many blockchain projects still face issues with scalability and interoperability. Qubetics ($TICS) addresses these gaps as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, offering seamless cross-chain functionality. With its presale starting at $0.01 and currently priced at $0.025 in its 10th stage, Qubetics is creating waves in the crypto market. Let’s break down what each of these cryptos brings to the table. Qubetics Solves Blockchain Interoperability with Web3 Aggregated Chain Qubetics sets itself apart with its Web3 aggregated chain , solving one of blockchain’s biggest challenges—interoperability. Most blockchain networks operate in isolation, limiting data sharing and cross-chain functionality. Qubetics tackles this issue by integrating networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana into a single, cohesive framework. For instance, consider an online retailer based in Texas. They can use Qubetics to accept payments in multiple cryptocurrencies from customers worldwide. The retailer doesn’t need to worry about exchanging currencies manually or handling multiple wallets, as Qubetics’ system ensures seamless asset transfers and data sharing across chains. This capability enhances collaboration and opens up new opportunities for businesses, developers, and individual users alike. By unlocking the potential of decentralised technology, Qubetics emerges as a critical player in the blockchain landscape. Qubetics Presale Opportunities The Qubetics presale , which began at $0.01 for whitelist participants, is now in its 10th stage, priced at $0.025. With over 251 million tokens sold and $3.9 million raised, it has attracted over 5,300 holders. The price will increase by 10% in the 11th stage, creating urgency for investors. Let’s break down an investment scenario. If you invest $500 at $0.025, you’d acquire 20,000 $TICS. By the end of the presale, when the price hits $0.25, your investment would grow to $5,000—a staggering 871% ROI. If $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, your $500 turns into $20,000, delivering a 3,787% ROI. With analysts predicting $15 at the mainnet launch, this investment could balloon to $300,000. This makes Qubetics one of the best altcoins to invest right now, combining innovation with massive growth potential. Tron Strengthens Decentralised Applications Tron has positioned itself as a major player in the blockchain space by focusing on decentralised applications (dApps). Its platform allows developers to build scalable dApps while keeping transaction fees nearly zero. This accessibility is a significant draw for content creators and businesses. Tron’s ability to process thousands of transactions per second places it as one of the best altcoins to invest right now. Its growing adoption in gaming and entertainment further solidifies its relevance in the blockchain space. Toncoin Redefines Blockchain For Messaging Apps Toncoin has taken a unique approach by integrating blockchain technology with messaging apps like Telegram. Its decentralised network allows users to send funds seamlessly through the app, merging social communication with cryptocurrency utility. However, Toncoin’s focus on messaging apps might limit its broader blockchain applications. Still, its niche offering has made it one of the best altcoins to invest right now, especially for those looking to explore crypto in a social setting. Conclusion Tron pushes the boundaries of dApps, Toncoin redefines blockchain for messaging, and Qubetics solves real-world interoperability issues while delivering incredible presale returns.

The Trump administration has promised a tone of goodies for the cryptocurrency industry due to the overwhelming support during last month’s election. Already, institutional investors’ confidence in the cryptocurrency industry has significantly surged in the recent past. Furthermore, the overall crypto cash inflow, as observed by the US spot BTC and Ether ETFs, has increased the ongoing bullish outlook. The Ex Parte Garland Playbook As the United States undergoes a crucial transition to welcome the Trump administration, the difference with the Democrats has been exacerbated by today’s President Biden’s pardon for his son, Hunter Biden. Furthermore, President Biden pardoned Hunter not only for the gun and tax convictions but also for any crime he might have committed in the last decade. As a result, Hunter is immune from any potential investigation by the Trump administration. Consequently, the crypto community has been pushing the upcoming Trump administration to exercise its powers to pardon unfair treatment of Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ). According to CZ, he would welcome a Presidential pardon but does not wish to be a CEO again, which will also align with the plea agreement. No wish to be CEO again. But definitely wouldn't mind a pardon. — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) December 2, 2024 Notably, CZ agreed to resign as Binance CEO and to pay a $50 million fine as part of the guilty plea to US federal charges. Additionally, Binance agreed to pay $4.3 billion in fines for violating US laws.

Besides, the top two cryptos, Bitcoin & Ethereum, continue to juggle within a narrow range, probably due to a massive liquidity shift into the other tokens. One among them is Dogecoin, which showed huge strength in the past few days and is currently preparing for another bullish wave. DOGE price broke the multi-year consolidation that held the levels largely below $0.15 and launched a 350% jump to mark the yearly highs at $0.48. Although the bulls seem to have halted a bit, they continue to maintain an ascending range, which suggests the top memecoin is preparing for the next bullish wave. With this, will the DOGE price reach $1 in 2025? The long-term price action suggests the bulls are strengthening their position to trigger a 500% rise over the next few months. The price remains consolidated within a rising parallel channel, and the recent rise from the pattern could push the price towards the resistance. Besides, the RSI entered the overbought zone and turned flat. However, the possibility of a continued upswing remains elevated as long as RSI trades within the bullish range, with the target at $0.7 for 2024 and over $11 in 2025. Besides, in the short term, the DOGE price is trading within a bull flag by maintaining a sustained rise within a pennant. With this, the price is expected to revamp a rise beyond $0.5, which may place the token at the edge of a massive explosion. A breakout from the range may trigger a 100% rise to mark $1, probably before the end of 2024 or in the first few days of 2025. On the other hand, memecoins like SHIB, PEPE, FLOKI, etc. have been ranging within a rising pattern, and hence, after a breakout, the price could trigger a huge upswing, forming new highs.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/dogecoin-is-about-to-explode-to-1-can-shiba-inu-pepe-attract-traders-attention-amid-doge-price-rally/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Coinbase ‘s top policy executive expects U.S. cryptocurrency regulations to move quickly once Donald Trump assumes the presidency in January 2025. In an interview with CNBC on Dec. 2, Coinbase’s chief policy officer Faryar Shirzad said that crypto legislation will likely progress “fairly quickly” through Congress after Trump takes office, pointing to the Republican president-elect’s strong pro-crypto stance and the party’s recent control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. “We have the most pro-crypto Congress ever and an extraordinarily pro-crypto president. This combination should allow the 50 million Americans who own crypto to have their interests heard in policy.” Faryar Shirzad You might also like: Trump in considerations for CFTC to regulate crypto CNBC notes that Shirzad’s comments coincide with two significant pieces of crypto-related legislation advancing through Congress: the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act and the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act.

Shirzad expressed optimism that the bills will pass, though he acknowledged the chance of consideration in the current “lame duck” session is low.

Binance – Big Ecosystem, Lower Rewards Binance, one of the largest crypto exchange, also offers staking with a wide range of assets. Users benefit from its brand reputation and ease of use with trading. But Binance’s staking rewards are lower than CryptoBox and it does not have advanced AI-driven insights to maximize earnings. Features: Wide selection of staking coins Reputable exchange with high volume Fixed and flexible staking options While Binance is a big name, CryptoBox’s AI and bonuses make it to have a better staking experience. Kraken – Trusted Platform, Limited Staking Options Kraken is another big player in the crypto space, offering staking for popular assets like Ethereum, Polkadot, and Solana. The platform is user-friendly for beginners but has limited staking options compared to CryptoBox’s 100+ assets. Features: High security and transparency Daily staking rewards for select assets Easy onboarding process While Kraken is reliable, CryptoBox has more assets and higher returns for serious investors. Stakewise – Liquid Staking With Fewer Perks Stakewise specializes in liquid staking, users can unlock staked funds for trading or other purposes.

Features: Liquid staking for Ethereum Decentralized platform with a focus on transparency Lower fees for staking services CryptoBox’s seamless integration of liquid staking with AI and its lucrative cashback rewards make it the better option for maximizing returns. Lido Finance – Leading Ethereum Staking Platform Lido Finance is the biggest Ethereum staking platform where users can earn rewards while having liquidity. Its popularity is mainly due to its simplicity and decentralized model. But it does not have multi-asset support and bonuses like CryptoBox’s Million Bounty Program which makes it less appealing. Features: Liquid staking for Ethereum and a few other assets Decentralized governance model Competitive staking rates Lido is good for Ethereum-focused investors, whereas CryptoBox is good for investors with 100+ assets and custom plans. Coinbase – Beginner Friendly, High Fees Coinbase offers staking as part of its exchange, convenient for new users. But the fees are high, cutting into potential profits. In contrast, CryptoBox ensures users keep more of their earnings and has AI-driven staking strategies for better results. Features: Big exchange with easy-to-use app Educational resources for beginners Limited staking options with high fees For those who want to earn more with less effort, CryptoBox delivers better value with a free staking plan and higher daily rewards which you get to keep.

In a post on social media platform X, the longtime Bitcoin bull says that those who save their money in fiat currencies will be left behind by those who save in BTC and precious metals. Kiyosaki says that after a certain point, the poor and the middle class will have missed their chance to get into BTC at a reasonable price, cementing their place on the wealth ladder. “THE RICH WILL GET RICHER: Q: WHO WILL BE RICHER? A: The people who save Gold, Silver. Bitcoin. I own all three financial assets. Q: WHO WILL BE POORER? A: The people who save dollars, Pesos, Yen, Euro, & Loonies. As I warned in Rich Dad Poor Dad ‘Savers are losers…because cash is trash.’ Bitcoin will soon break $100,000. Once Bitcoin passes $100,000, it will be almost impossible for the poor and middle class to catch up. The horse will be out of the barn and running. WHY? Once Bitcoin breaks $100,000, ONLY the ultra-rich such as corporations, banks, and sovereign wealth funds will be able to afford Bitcoin of any consequence. FOMO (fear of missing out) is good. Don’t be left behind. Don’t let the rich get richer…without You. Take care.” Last month, Kiyosaki said that his goal was to own 100 BTC, regardless of price.

Speaking to CNBC , Shirzad highlighted the potential for the rapid passage of cryptocurrency laws, thanks to Trump’s pro-crypto platform and the Republican Party’s newfound dominance in Congress. With both the House of Representatives and Senate under Republican control, Shirzad expects the cryptocurrency market to see significant regulatory progress once the president-elect takes office. Satoshi Club Alerts @satoshi_alerts · Follow Coinbase’s Faryar Shirzad: Expect significant progress on crypto legislation in the US by 2025. Full article: cnbc.com/2024/12/02/coi… > 12:29 PM · Dec 2, 2024 0 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter Unprecedented time for cryptocurrency in US politics Trump’s victory has created a favorable environment for the 50 million Americans who own cryptocurrency, according to Shirzad. The combination of a Republican-controlled Congress and a president who is widely seen as an ally of the crypto industry sets the stage for legislation to move through Capitol Hill “fairly quickly.” Shirzad emphasized that this is an unprecedented time for cryptocurrency in US politics, with the most pro-crypto Congress in history poised to work alongside an enthusiastic president. Shirzad’s comments come as two key pieces of crypto legislation advance through Congress. The first, the Republican-backed Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act , seeks to create a clear legal framework for digital assets. The bill has already passed the House of Representatives. The second bill, The Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act , aims to establish a regulatory regime for stablecoins, which are digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. While the stablecoin bill has not yet passed the House, Shirzad is optimistic that both pieces of legislation will make significant progress, if not pass, by 2025. Despite the strong momentum, Shirzad noted that the chances of seeing crypto laws approved during the post-election “lame duck” period are slim. However, with Trump’s presidency set to begin in January 2025, the crypto community can expect significant developments in legislation related to market structure and stablecoins. Growing influence of crypto’s lobbying efforts Political action committees (PACs) connected to the crypto industry raised over $245 million in campaign donations, according to data from the Federal Election Commission. Additionally, the Coinbase-backed Stand With Crypto Alliance has already worked to establish a grading system that assesses House and Senate candidates’ stances on crypto. Nearly 300 lawmakers who support crypto interests are set to take office, a promising sign for the future of digital assets in the US. The election results also signal an impending leadership change at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Chairman Gary Gensler, known for his stringent approach to crypto regulation, announced his departure ahead of Trump’s inauguration. While Shirzad could not speculate on who Trump would choose to replace Gensler, he expressed confidence that Trump’s appointee would align with his pro-crypto vision, further accelerating the shift toward crypto-friendly policies. For Shirzad and the crypto community, the prospect of a Trump presidency represents not only a political shift but also a golden opportunity to create a regulatory environment that supports innovation and protects the interests of cryptocurrency holders in the US.

37124655,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656242,1733126445,"Crypto Analyst Says Litecoin Is About To Pull An XRP, Here’s What He Means","Crypto analyst Tony Severino said Litecoin is about to pull an XRP, suggesting that the coin could soon enjoy a parabolic rally. The analyst alluded to a bullish indicator on LTC’s chart, which showed that the crypto could witness this parabolic rally. Litecoin Is About To Pull An XRP, Here’s Why In an X post, Tony Severino said that Litecoin is about to pull an XRP, noting that the crypto is now above the monthly upper Bollinger Band . This suggests that LTC has undergone the necessary price correction and is now well-primed for a bullish reversal. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that a wick to the upside was already forming for the crypto on the monthly chart. Severino didn’t give a price target for how high Litecoin could rally when this move to the upside occurs. However, the chart showed that the $150 and $300 price levels were in view, a rally that could ultimately pave the way for LTC to rally to its current all-time high (ATH) of $412. It is worth mentioning that the crypto analyst had also recently made a similar analysis for XRP. Before now, Severino mentioned XRP is just above the monthly upper Bollinger Band just as BB Width expands from the tightest squeeze in XRP history. He added that this is going to shock and awe. Since then, XRP has enjoyed a parabolic rally of over 200% and is now above the $2 mark, a level the analyst’s chart showed the crypto could surpass. Therefore, this Litecoin analysis is undoubtedly one to watch since the crypto analyst predicts that LTC will pull an XRP. Litecoin has yet to enjoy its bull run, although it already looks to be catching up, considering it is up over 24% in the last seven days. The Next Dino Coin To Run? Like Severino, crypto analyst Crypto Snorlax has also suggested that Litecoin will be the next ‘ Dino coin ’ to witness a parabolic rally. In an X post , the analyst highlighted a chart overlaying XRP’s price action over LTC’s. Based on this analysis, Crypto Snorlax revealed two interesting findings. Firstly, he noted that there is a strong correlation between old altcoins. With XRP recording a 5x price increase from its bottom range, the analyst expects Litecoin to follow shortly. Secondly, Crypto Snorlax revealed that Litecoin just broke above $115, an 18-month resistance. Therefore, Litecoin is well primed for a significant rally, having flipped this resistance to support. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that LTC could enjoy up to a 3x price increase and reach as high as $450, which would mark a new ATH for the crypto. At the time of writing, Litecoin is trading at around $121, up over 20% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",POSITIVE,LTC | XRP,ALTCOIN | LTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/ltc/litecoin-about-to-pull-an-xrp/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png
37124653,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655494,1733126423,Monitok’s AI Trading Assistant  — Your Key to Smarter Crypto Decisions,"As we come to the end of 2024, it’s important to acknowledge that although there have been some ups and downs this year, some great inroads have also been made such as the Bitcoin halving event (marking the start of the bull market), approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, as well as the implementation of Ethereum’s Dencun Upgrade (enhancing the leading Layer 2’s efficiency, scalability and security). However, when it comes to crypto trading, things haven’t been smooth sailing, and traders have had to deal with the impacts of a more complex and saturated crypto market. This has included volatility levels reaching all-time highs , trading fees going up, and liquidity being spread thin across exchanges. The good news is that with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), crypto traders and developers now have the ability to create powerful AI agents that provide a competitive edge . Amongst these is Monitok’s hybrid crypto exchange with an AI trading assistant, which goes beyond mere automation, and offers predictive analytics, personalized trade recommendations, and real-time risk management – to name a few features. Challenges That Modern Crypto Traders Face With crypto markets becoming increasingly saturated and unpredictable, traders are confronted with a host of new challenges, creating roadblocks that can be overwhelming without the right support or solution in place. Let’s dive into some of the most common challenges currently facing crypto traders. 1) Overwhelming amount of new tokens With thousands of crypto tokens launching across multiple blockchain networks, crypto traders face an increasingly difficult task—finding value amidst a flood of new assets. This oversaturation often leads to confusion and missed opportunities as traders struggle to evaluate each new project (due to a lack of time), and also increases the risk of falling into illiquid or low-performing assets. 2) Increased volatility Although volatility is often one of the reasons why crypto swing traders can make impressive gains, it’s also one of the most dangerous aspects of trading. This is because market conditions can change in seconds, and many traders often find themselves ill-equipped or unable to respond to sudden price swings in both a rapid and informed manner. 3) Liquidity fragmentation Another common frustration amongst crypto traders is an increase in liquidity fragmentation. With liquidity often spread thinly across various exchanges and platforms, trading conditions have suffered, and often result in slippage, delays, or poor pricing. This not only reduces efficiency but creates extra hurdles for those looking to execute large trades or capitalize on quick market shifts. 4) High transaction fees + network congestion Rising transaction fees and network congestion continue to be persistent issues in the crypto space. During busy periods, network slowdowns can cost traders valuable time and money, while high gas fees can take away from profits. So without efficient management, these issues can become costly; and for even the most skilled of traders. 5) AI-driven competition As AI crypto bots become more omnipresent and readily available, it’s starting to create a divide between those who use them, and those who don’t. AI trading bots are often outpacing the manual data collection and analyses of most crypto traders, and also offer superior evaluation of crypto asset performance. AI does this by being able to collect, track and interpret the “right” data correctly, helping to foresee the impact of macro events to markets, and knowing when to take profit; helping traders to manage emotions and greed. This gives those who embrace AI a distinct advantage. AI Technology in Modern Crypto Trading Given the challenges seen above, it’s not surprising how more and more developers are seeking to leverage AI to enhance crypto trading. Below are some examples of how AI is revolutionizing crypto trading. How AI is revolutionizing crypto trading Firstly, AI has the ability to detect patterns in large datasets and provides traders with insights that would otherwise be missed. More specifically, AI-powered tools can identify correlations between market events, price movements, and trading volume that are nearly impossible for humans to spot. This enables traders to refine their strategies with next-level precision. Another very impressive (and useful) feature of AI for crypto trading is its ability to process vast amounts of quantitative data and in real-time. So instead of having to spend ages manually analyzing order books, technical indicators, and market sentiment, AI allows traders to do this far quicker, and more efficiently. This in turn allows traders to rapidly respond to market shifts during periods of high volatility. AI-powered bots also have the ability to automate the trading process in ways that can greatly enhance efficiency. Executing trades faster than humans ever could, allows traders to act on opportunities the moment they arise. But perhaps the most appealing utility is AI’s predictive models, which attempt to forecast price movements by analyzing historical data and current trends, and at times yields surprisingly accurate predictions. Although not foolproof, these AI models can be very useful for managing risks, and gauging potential market shifts. How Monitok’s AI Assistant Simplifies Decision-making To bring additional value to users, Monitok’s revolutionary hybrid crypto exchange will be incorporating a cutting-edge AI assistant to help simplify (and enhance) the decision-making process based on users’ profiles and market trends. Below there are some of the core features of the new AI assistant, and how they will each bring value to Monitok users. Predictive analytics for trading Monitok’s AI assistant includes predictive analytics and will process real-time data and historical trends to help traders identify patterns, and anticipate market movements with greater accuracy. This is a process that usually takes human hours to conduct manually. Personalized AI trade recommendations Monitok’s AI assistant is more than a one-size-fits-all solution and offers personalized trade recommendations by analyzing users’ trading habits, risk tolerance, and market conditions. This is designed to optimize profits whilst simultaneously saving users time. Automated trade selection To further simplify the trading process, Monitok’s AI assistant automates trade selection, executing transactions at the most opportune moments. This reduces the burden on traders to constantly monitor the market and react to rapid price fluctuations. Gauging social sentiment By collecting on-chain data, and scraping data from crypto social media and news outlets, the AI assistant iwill then feed them through an LLMs to provide a holistic social sentiment on various markets, tokens and projects. Real-time risk management Last but not least, Monitok’s AI assistant offers real-time risk management, meaning it continuously monitors market conditions and adjusts strategies to mitigate potential losses. This feature is particularly useful during market downturns. Why Monitok’s Users Should be Excited While there are a few AI trading bots in the crypto industry, most fail to address the full spectrum of challenges traders face. Monitok, however, will offer something far more well-rounded with its AI trading assistant (set to be released in Q3, 2025) and revolutionary hybrid exchange, which already solves key issues such as a lack of security, complex user experience, and fragmented liquidity.

37125108,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51150,1733126421,Controversy About XRP’s Actual Market Cap,"Bill Morgan, a prominent attorney on X, has sparked a debate within the cryptocurrency community regarding the accuracy of XRP’s reported market capitalization. As XRP recently hit a multi-year high of $1.9513, questions have arisen about whether its true market cap is being underreported due to how circulating supply is calculated. Morgan argues that XRP’s market cap should reflect the approximately 62 billion tokens not locked in escrow rather than the 57.8 billion tokens currently reported as its circulating supply by CoinMarketCap. There is less than 38 billion XRP left in escrow which means than when XRP reached $1.90 it’s market cap was almost $118 billion not $107 billion which is not being shown on @CoinMarketCap . If so it has already flipped Solana. pic.twitter.com/oKHLdDwuNY — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) November 30, 2024 Ripple’s XRP holdings recently dropped below 39% , and at $1.90 per token, Morgan claims the market cap should be closer to $118 billion, a significant increase from the $107 billion figure derived from the listed supply. In response to critics, Morgan clarified his methodology, “I am counting 62 billion not in escrow multiplied by $1.90. Do the math.” He dismissed the categorization of Ripple’s holdings outside escrow as “undistributed,” arguing that it is a subjective and arbitrary exclusion from the circulating supply. The debate has drawn mixed reactions. One user countered , “Your maths is off as the circulating supply excludes ‘escrow’ and ‘undistributed.’ The latter belongs to Ripple outside of escrow.” Others reiterated that escrow doesn’t get counted until it has entered the market. Morgan, however, remains firm in his position, emphasizing that his calculations do not include escrowed tokens. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Has XRP Surpassed Solana? This issue is particularly relevant given XRP’s recent performance. After being overtaken by Solana in late 2023, XRP’s resurgence to $1.94 has reignited competition between the two assets. Morgan shared a screenshot showing Solana’s market cap at $115 billion at the time of his post, but his recalculations suggest XRP may have already surpassed it. At the time of press, XRP is trading at $2.42, up over 30% in the past 24 hours. The digital asset has officially flipped Solana and Tether (USDT) to reclaim the third position after years of struggles and price suppressions. Many experts have predicted that XRP will surpass Ethereum in this cycle. However, Morgan’s post is important as it highlights a significant valuation issue in the market that could hamper digital assets.

37124529,https://crypto.news/?p=14315322,1733126196,South Korea to postpone Crypto Tax bill to 2027,"South Korean regulators agree to postpone the 20% crypto tax for two years, after rejecting the Democratic Party’s proposal to raise the annual tax threshold from 2.5 million won to 50 million won. According to local media outlet Money Today , Democratic Party floor leader Park Chan-dae announced at a press conference that the DP has agreed to the government’s plan to postpone the tax on crypto traders for another two years, pushing back the bill intended for 2025 to 2027. Park said that the government needs “more institutional preparation” before regulators can systematically begin to tax crypto traders. “After in-depth discussions on the postponement of taxation on virtual assets, I thought that now is the time for additional institutional overhaul,” said Park. The National Assembly will vote on Dec. 2, 2024 to decide the fate of South Korea’s crypto tax proposal, with both parties in agreement to postpone the tax. Initially, the DP had opposed the People’s Power Party’s plans to postpone the launch, insisting that the 20% tax on crypto traders must be launched in January 2025. In addition, the DP had also proposed raising the annual tax threshold from 2.5 million won ($1,781) to 50 million won ($35,633). But the government had rejected the main opposition party’s proposal, instead voting in favor of PPP’s motion to delay the crypto tax to 2027. You might also like: South Korean FSC dismiss plans to build Bitcoin reserve ‘for the time being’ Additionally, Park said that there is still room for negotiations regarding the 13 bills proposed by the government, which include the crypto tax bill, the inheritance bill and the gift tax bill among others. This means that the 20% tax on crypto traders earning a profit minimum of 2.5 million won is still subject to change. “If the government does not take any action, an even greater reduction is possible with the revised plan [which modifies the current reduction plan],” said Park. This marks the third time the South Korean government has decided to postpone the virtual asset tax bill. It was first introduced in December 2020 and scheduled for implementation as early as 2021, but then the bill was delayed to 2025. Now, it has a very strong chance of being postponed even further to 2027. The law would implement a 20% tax with an extra 2% local tax towards profits exceeding 2.5 million won or around $1,781. Several major crypto exchanges argued against the 2.5 million won threshold, saying that a 20% tax on the basic deduction would make trading volumes plummet.

37124698,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620917,1733126117,Coinbase policy chief predicts swift crypto legislation under Trump,"Coinbase’s policy boss, Faryar Shirzad, thinks America’s crypto regulation is about to hit full throttle under Donald Trump’s return to the Oval. Speaking at a U.K. event hosted by Coinbase-backed advocacy group Stand With Crypto, Shirzad reportedly called the president the most pro-crypto leader in history. “We have the most pro-crypto Congress ever,” he said, referring to Republicans sweeping the House and Senate. With Trump and his allies running the show, Shirzad predicts the long-stalled crypto bills will finally gain traction. For the 50 million Americans holding crypto, this could be the moment their interests are taken seriously in Washington. “I think the combination should finally allow the 50 million Americans who own crypto to have their interests and voice heard in policy,” Shirzad added. Two key bills on the table Congress isn’t starting from scratch. Two major crypto bills are already in the pipeline, and they could reshape how digital assets are treated in the U.S. The first is the Republican-led Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. This one’s a big deal. It lays out the rules for how crypto will be regulated and managed, something the industry has been screaming for over the past decade. The bill has already passed the House, setting the stage for smoother progress when the new administration steps in. The second bill, the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, targets stablecoins. Ideally, it would set up a licensing system for stablecoin issuers, creating a solid framework for these tokens, which are critical to the broader crypto ecosystem. But unlike its counterpart, this one hasn’t cleared the House yet. Shirzad is hopeful but realistic, admitting that the stablecoin bill might not see movement until Trump is fully seated well into 2025. Trump’s return and Gensler’s highly-anticipated departure Trump’s victory wasn’t just a win for him, it was a power move for the entire crypto industry. The numbers back it up. Crypto-related PACs raised over $245 million during the election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission data. That money funded campaigns, rallied support, and stacked Congress with nearly 300 pro-crypto lawmakers. Coinbase’s Stand With Crypto Alliance created a grading system to evaluate candidates based on their crypto stance. The result? A Congress that’s now ready to listen to the industry. Then there’s Gary Gensler, the SEC chair who’s been a thorn in crypto’s side for years. He’s out the door on January 20, the day of Trump’s inauguration. Gensler’s tenure was filled with aggressive crackdowns on crypto. Trump, though, has brought a new direction. Shirzad wouldn’t speculate on who Trump might pick to replace Gensler but said the president-elect has a knack for choosing people who align with his vision. “As long as he picks somebody who’s a change agent, it’ll be good for the U.S., good for society, good for the people that own crypto,” he noted.

U.S. asset managers have filed plans with regulators to launch Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds that use derivatives to eliminate or at least minimize potential losses in an effort to attract cautious investors seeking exposure to the crypto market with reduced risk. According to a Financial Times report on Monday, Dec. 2, the proposals include a range of “buffered” and “managed floor” strategies, which reduce risks by protecting investors from big losses but limit how much profit they can make. Calamos Investments, First Trust Portfolios, Innovator ETFs, and Grayscale Investments are among the firms seeking the green light from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the report reads. Each firm plans to offer products using buffered or managed floor strategies to protect against losses of up to 30%, while some also propose covered call ETFs or leveraged variations.

Eros Biondini introduced a bill on Monday suggesting Brazil's central bank establish a strategic reserve called ResBit. The plan involves gradually purchasing bitcoin until it makes up 5% of Brazil’s national reserves , as reported by local sources. The initiative follows similar moves in the United States, where Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis is advocating for a national bitcoin reserve. Lummis, who previously proposed this idea during the Bitcoin 2024 conference, plans to reintroduce her bill now that Donald Trump is set to return to the White House. Her proposal suggests the U.S. Treasury acquire 1 million bitcoins over five years , to be held for at least 20 years. Lummis believes this approach could help address the national deficit and strengthen the economy. “It’s gaining momentum,” she told the Washington Examiner, emphasizing the need to rally support in Congress. Biondini’s bill highlights how countries like El Salvador and the U.S. are integrating cryptocurrencies into their financial systems. According to the proposal, investing in bitcoin would boost financial sovereignty and support economic growth in Brazil. Both Brazil’s and the U.S.’s plans share some common ground. They propose holding bitcoin in cold storage for security and require public reporting of transactions. However, while Lummis’s bill sets a 20-year holding period, Brazil’s proposal does not specify when the bitcoin could be sold. Despite Trump’s apparent support for bitcoin , experts believe the U.S. has a long road ahead before such a bill becomes law. Even so, odds from Polymarket suggest there’s a 25% chance Trump may announce a bitcoin reserve within his first 100 days in office.

From the breakout on 9 November, Shiba Inu increased nearly 50% before topping out on 12th at the high of $0.00003. After the correction from the top, SHIB has failed to regain strength. However, it trades above the short-term moving averages of 10 and 20. While it has taken support from the 10-DMA several times, it has only touched 20 twice, which indicates that the coin still has strong buying power. According to technical analysis, Shiba Inu is trading inside the triangle pattern, which will work out as a bullish continuation pattern if it breaks out from the upper resistance. The breakout level of this triangle pattern coincides with the $0.000025 resistance level, which is the major level to watch in the next few days. The first target for the SHIB price is $0.00003, the recent swing high. The next target could be the March resistance level of $0.000032. If it breaks down, the major support levels are $0.000022 and $0.00002. Brett trades in bullish flag pattern In technical analysis comparison, Brett has shown stronger strength than Shiba Inu but lags behind Cutoshi. After the rally in early November, Brett has been trading in a bullish flag pattern. This flag pattern in Brett has a depth of 15% and a duration of 14 days. Currently, the price is near the breakout level. If buyers take control, the recent swing high might be taken out. Brett’s relative strength index is at 67, near the overbought zone, but it might go higher if the price breaks the near resistance levels. The MACD is showing mixed signals as the MA lines are flat. The change in direction of the MA lines will further decide the direction of Brett’s price. To learn more about the Cutoshi presale, visit the website.

Base’s ecosystem has played a crucial role in its success. Popular gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, such as Uniswap and Aerodrome, have thrived on the network. Viral trends like Clanker and Virtuals Protocol memes have further driven user engagement. These factors have helped Base secure the second-highest Total Value Locked ( TVL ) among Ethereum Layer-2 solutions, reaching $12.54 billion, second only to Arbitrum. The network’s strong performance is also linked to its backing by Coinbase, a company valued at $73 billion. With Coinbase’s vast resources and user base, Base offers enhanced scalability and simplified interactions for dApp users. These advantages position Base as a leading competitor in the Ethereum Layer-2 market, outpacing networks like Optimism. By focusing on innovation without relying on token incentives, Base aims to solve real-world problems and continue its growth. Its success underscores the potential of blockchain networks to thrive by prioritizing developer support and practical applications.

37124226,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-warns-brics-over-dollar-rival-plans,1733125534,Trump Warns BRICS Over Dollar Rival Plans,"Donald Trump , the incoming U.S. President, has issued a strong warning to BRICS nations over their plans to challenge the dominance of the U.S. dollar in global trade. The BRICS bloc, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has been working on alternatives, including a new currency and the use of digital assets, to reduce reliance on the dollar. In a statement on Truth Social, Trump demanded that BRICS nations abandon these plans. He warned of severe consequences, including 100% tariffs on goods and restricted access to the U.S. market, if the bloc continued pursuing a rival currency. “The idea that the BRICS countries are trying to move away from the dollar while we stand by is over,” Trump stated. He insisted that the U.S. would not allow any attempts to weaken the dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency. Trump’s stance aligns with his “America First” policy and campaign promises to protect the dollar’s global dominance. Reports indicate his team is already considering punitive actions against nations backing de-dollarization initiatives. His administration views the BRICS efforts as a threat to U.S. economic power, particularly as the bloc has expanded its membership and influence. The BRICS group has been pushing for alternatives to the dollar since 2023, exploring mechanisms like using local currencies, the Chinese yuan, and blockchain-based stablecoins for trade. These measures could help member nations bypass Western sanctions and reduce dependency on the U.S.-led financial system. At a recent summit, BRICS nations discussed ways to reshape international trade, including creating a new framework that avoids reliance on the dollar. The bloc also expanded its membership for the first time in over a decade, adding Iran, Saudi Arabia, the UAE , Ethiopia, and Egypt. With 34 other nations expressing interest in joining, BRICS aims to strengthen its economic influence and challenge the West’s dominance in global trade. Market analysts suggest that these alternative currencies could allow BRICS countries to avoid U.S. sanctions, offering more flexibility in global transactions. However, Trump’s aggressive response signals a possible escalation in economic tensions between the U.S. and BRICS nations. His administration is expected to take a tough approach to counter these moves, which could reshape the global financial landscape. Observers note that the U.S. and BRICS are on a collision course over the future of international trade. While the BRICS bloc seeks greater independence from the dollar, Trump’s hardline stance underscores the importance of protecting the U.S. economy and its role in global finance. With BRICS’ efforts gaining momentum, this conflict could define a new era of economic competition. Trump’s warning highlights the stakes for both sides as they navigate a rapidly changing global economy.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-warns-brics-over-dollar-rival-plans,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37124226.jpeg

Michael Saylor’s Bold Prediction appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News MicroStrategy, with its impressive BTC holding of 386,700 BTC , worth $37,335,320,418, is currently the top public company in terms of Bitcoin holdings. Recent developments indicate that the company is now very keen to encourage other companies to adopt Bitcoin. Recently, in a sensational 3-minute presentation, MicroStrategy former CEO Michael Saylor explained why top companies like Microsoft can no longer ignore Bitcoin and even advised the Redmond-based American multinational technology conglomerate to consider exploring MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy . Here is everything you should know about Saylor’s extraordinary presentation. Saylor About Superiority of Digital Assets Saylor initially explained how global wealth is distributed between assets that provide utility and others that provide capital. He also discussed in detail how risky it is to invest in traditional assets. Presenting digital capital as the best strategy to avoid the threat of risk, he stated that this class of capital is far superior to physical capital. Projecting the emergence of the digital capital sector as a revolutionary advance in the area of capital preservation, he mentioned investors’ growing interest and its newly received political and economic backing. Bitcoin as the Future of Technology Highlighting Bitcoin as the greatest digital transformation of the 21st century, he described how it has outperformed MicroSoft over the last four years. In the last four years, Bitcoin has seen a growth of 402.005%, while Microsoft has surged by just 96.71%. Pointing at the charts, like the annualised asset performance chart, showcasing the exceptional performance of Bitcoin over others, Saylor claimed that it is more sensible for MicroSoft to invest in the largest cryptocurrency than to pursue stocks and bonds. Risks of Bonds v.s. Bitcoin Emphasising the capability of Bitcoin to minimise the element of risk, and warning how bonds undermine liquidity, Saylor projected investing in BTC as the only method before MicroSoft to achieve exceptional success. Public and Political Support for Bitcoin Saylor mentioned the growing public support for the Bitcoin market. Highlighting Donald Trump’s recent statement advising investors not to sell Bitcoin, he noted the recent shifts in the political landscape in favor of BTC. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Where Bitcoin Will Be Heading in December: Analyst Eyes For $150K Mark , Saylor’s Call to Action: Embrace Bitcoin Pointed out how Microsoft has amplified the risks for its shareholders by investing over $200B in the last five years, he explained why the company urgently needs an asset like Bitcoin with no counterparty risk. Advising MicroSoft to convert their cash flows, dividends, buybacks and debts into Bitcoin, Saylor explained how the company could add hundreds of dollars to its value and eliminate risk. Saylor even invited MicroSoft to go through MicrosStrategy’s open source Bitcoin investment model. Finally, MicroStrategy’s former CEO strongly advised MicroSoft to consider investing in Bitcoin , indirectly emphasising it as a move necessary for the general good of the world. In conclusion, Michael Saylor’s call to MicroSoft emphasises the immense potential of Bitcoin as a strategic digital asset. FAQs How has Bitcoin outperformed Microsoft in recent years?

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/mr-chill-doge-mrdoge-solana-memecoin-will-explode-14000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

His call comes in response to Operation Chokepoint 2.0, a global initiative aimed at disrupting the crypto industry through measures like debanking, audits, and fines. Hoskinson stressed that internal conflicts must end if the industry hopes to overcome these challenges and achieve mainstream acceptance. In a November 30 post on X (formerly Twitter), Hoskinson addressed his past criticisms of ecosystems such as Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana, urging reconciliation. He encouraged the Cardano community to let go of old grievances and embrace collaboration across all crypto ecosystems. “Let the comments and opinions of the past go and embrace a full reset of all ecosystems,” he wrote. Hoskinson acknowledged that many influencers from rival platforms have previously dismissed Cardano. However, he pointed out that attitudes are shifting, with more people recognizing its potential. He emphasized the need to abandon tribalism , which he sees as a major barrier to widespread adoption and long-term growth. Looking ahead to 2025, Hoskinson envisions a united crypto industry driving progress and expanding markets. He argued that the next two years represent a critical period for the industry to establish itself as a mainstream financial asset . “We have a window to make crypto mainstream and grow our markets to tens of trillions of dollars of value,” he said, urging the community to set aside divisions and seize emerging opportunities. Hoskinson’s comments come as the industry continues to grapple with the effects of Operation Chokepoint 2.0. This campaign, which uses aggressive tactics to isolate crypto businesses, has had a global impact , disrupting financial operations and causing significant harm. “Many businesses were harassed, fined, audited, and de-platformed,” he noted. By focusing on shared goals and building solidarity, Hoskinson believes the crypto industry can overcome external threats and achieve broader adoption.

37123939,https://coinpaprika.com/news/how-politics-killed-facebook-s-libra-project,1733125022,How Politics Killed Facebook’s Libra Project,"David Marcus, the former leader of Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency project, has shed light on the reasons behind the initiative’s failure, pointing to political opposition rather than legal or regulatory challenges. His comments reveal how intense political pressures and the debanking of supporting institutions ultimately dismantled Libra, later rebranded as Diem. Announced in 2019, Libra aimed to transform global payments with a stablecoin backed by a cutting-edge blockchain. Despite its potential and extensive efforts to address regulatory concerns, the project was met with immediate resistance. Marcus shared that political forces were the decisive factor, stating, “There was no legal or regulatory issue left for regulators to use against us. It was a 100% political kill , executed through intimidation of captive banks.” Marcus highlighted key events that led to the project's collapse. Initially postponed to address concerns, Libra faced unwavering political hostility. A major turning point came after a meeting between Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. According to Marcus, Yellen described supporting Libra as “political suicide.” This prompted the Federal Reserve to caution banks involved with the project. Banks reportedly received calls from the Fed's general counsel, warning, “We can’t stop you from launching, but we’re not comfortable with it.” These warnings effectively ended the initiative. Marcus also revealed that this political resistance had broader implications. Kathryn Haun, a former Libra board member, and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, supported his account. Winklevoss described how Federal regulators halted the project despite its near readiness, stating, “It was all politics, no legal basis .” Reflecting on this experience, Marcus emphasized the importance of decentralization in future financial systems. He argued that truly global monetary networks need to be built on neutral, tamper-proof systems like Bitcoin, saying, “If you want to build an open monetary network for the world—designed to move trillions daily and last for a century—it must be based on the most decentralized and neutral asset: Bitcoin .” Marcus’s revelations have reignited debates about political interference in innovation, particularly in the cryptocurrency sector.

37123926,https://coinpedia.org/?p=387882,1733124999,Why XRP Price is Surging Today? Is XRP ATH Imminent in December?,"The post Why XRP Price is Surging Today? Is XRP ATH Imminent in December? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP news today highlights its price surge past $2, reaching its highest levels since 2018. This jump, bringing its market cap above $100 billion, comes after a prolonged period of stagnation due to Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC Now, it seems like XRP is reclaiming its place in the market, and there’s more exciting news on the horizon. In a video analysis by Altcoin Daily the analyst charts out the key factors behind this bullish rally. Let’s dive straight into the facts. Ripple’s Stablecoin Could Be a Game-Changer The main factor driving XRP’s rise is Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin , RLUSD. Ripple is close to getting regulatory approval to launch the stablecoin, which could happen as soon as December 4th. The company has been working to ensure it complies with U.S. regulations before going live. Once RLUSD gets the green light, it could have a big impact on XRP’s price. A recent report from Fox Business revealed that the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) could approve RLUSD soon. If this happens, Ripple’s software could be used more widely by traditional banks, which could adopt RLUSD for transactions. As more banks use Ripple’s software, the demand for XRP is likely to rise as well, benefiting the token. Ripple’s Growing Footprint in the Stablecoin Market RLUSD has the potential to make a huge impact on the $200 billion stablecoin market, which is currently led by Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC). With Ripple already well-integrated into the financial system, the addition of a stablecoin could further boost XRP’s utility and adoption. The more RLUSD is used, the more XRP could be needed for transactions, creating a positive feedback loop that benefits both Ripple and XRP. Legal Battle with the SEC May Soon End Another factor that’s giving positive vibes is the Ripple vs SEC case coming to an end . SEC Chairman Gary Gensler recently announced he will step down in January , and many in the XRP community are hopeful that his departure could lead to a more favorable outcome for Ripple. Legal experts, including attorney Jeremy Hogan, suggest that the SEC may drop all non-fraud crypto cases, including Ripple’s, which could result in a settlement. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple Marks a 6-Year High, Smashes $2.5-Here’s the XRP Price Prediction for 2025 After a 300% Rise , Positive Market Signals for XRP Looking at XRP’s technical indicators, there are bullish signs across short, medium, and long-term trends. The moving averages show positive crossovers, suggesting potential price strength. While volatility is moderate at 7.75%, the RSI is at 93.89, indicating neutral conditions. The MACD shows mild upward momentum, signaling positive pressure in the market. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.39. FAQs Is XRP a Good Investment? XRP could be a good investment due to the upcoming launch of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD and the potential end of its legal battle with the SEC, which may drive increased demand. However, its volatility and market risks should be carefully considered. Can Ripple reach 100 euros? Reaching 100 euros seems unlikely for XRP, as it would require an unrealistic market cap and drastic changes like massive token burns.

The decision was made after the exchange suffered a hack in May. Hackers siphoned off over 4502.9 bitcoin (BTC), worth nearly $305 million at the time.  DMM Bitcoin had restricted its services such as withdrawals and the acceptance of purchase orders for spot crypto assets since the loss of the funds, but acknowledged that allowing the situation to continue would impair its customers. “We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused over such a long period of time,” it said.  Who was behind the theft is not clear – though fingers have been pointed at North Korea’s shadowy cyberhackers the Lazarus Group. Money from the hack also appears to have passed through Huione Guarantee, a Cambodian payments company that has enabled the laundering of billions in illicit funds.

37123615,https://crypto.news/?p=14315326,1733124375,SBI VC trade to acquire Japan’s DMM Bitcoin following May hack,"Japanese cryptocurrency exchange DMM Bitcoin is reportedly ceasing all efforts to relaunch the hacked trading platform despite initiating recovery plans. According to a Nikkei Asia report , the exchange will shut down operations and sell all assets to SBI Group-owned trading company SBI VC Trade, with the sale expected to be completed by March 2025. A Dec. 2 statement released by SBI VC Trade confirms that the company has reached an agreement with the exchange and will acquire all Japan crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin set for liquidation. The specific date of transfer will be disclosed in an upcoming announcement. As a part of the acquisition, SBI VC Trade will expand its offering by introducing 14 cryptocurrency trading pairs currently available on DMM Bitcoin but not yet supported by SBI VC Trade. This expansion is planned to be completed before the transfer of customer accounts and assets, ensuring a seamless transition for the hacked exchange’s users. The developments are somewhat unexpected considering that DMM Bitcoin had initiated recovery efforts and promised to make all users whole after the May 30 incident. Over 4,500 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $308 million at the time, was drained from one of the exchange’s wallets, making it the second largest hack in Japan, following the $534 million Coincheck hack in 2018.

It was a part of the exchange’s plans to raise $320 million to pay back its customers. Meanwhile, in July, the attackers, suspected to be the notorious Lazarus Group, were seen laundering a portion of the stolen funds via Huione Guarantee, an online marketplace turned hub for illicit activities. Additionally, in August, another 500 BTC was moved to multiple wallets. So far, all efforts to recover the stolen assets have failed. DMM Bitcoin becomes the latest Asian exchange to wind down its operations in 2024. WazirX , an Indian-origin exchange, has halted its operations in July after a $235 million hack of its hot wallet. In October, it was revealed that over a dozen South Korean crypto exchanges had shut down in 2024 after failing to comply with local regulations.

November’s rally was one of the strongest on record as to generated a 3.42% gain. However, the upcoming economic data remains crucial for the market. This week will see key releases include manufacturing data, consumer spending, and the all-important jobs report on Friday. As of now, CME shows that the probability of a 25bps rate cut on December 18 is 67%, while the rate unchanged gets 32.9%. Job openings, ADP, and non-farm payrolls set to move markets US agencies will be releasing the unemployment rate and ADP employment figures for November along with the new non-farm payrolls the same month. Later, the Fed is expected to release the Beige Book on economic conditions, and Jerome Powell will be interviewed. The upcoming date stands pivotal for the labor market. It will see ISM Manufacturing PMI on Monday. Manufacturing has been in contraction for months. A surprise expansion could boost cyclical stocks, while further contraction could raise growth concerns. JOLTS Job Openings will be out on Tuesday and a decline in openings could spark rate cut speculation, which might support market momentum. Stronger-than-expected numbers might dampen such expectations. Next in line is ADP Employment Change, expected to be released on Wednesday. It will be out just before Friday’s jobs report and a high miss could boost markets on hopes of Fed easing. Meanwhile, a strong report might lead to short-term volatility. Source: CME Group Decisive of them all, the Initial Jobless claims will hit the market on Thursday. The market will be watching for the signs of labor market softening. An uptick in claims could support cooling economy narratives, while lower-than-expected claims could challenge recent optimism. The key event of the week, Non-Farm Payrolls, is set to be delivered on Friday. After October’s weak numbers, markets will focus on whether the trend continues. Wage growth and the unemployment rate will also be crucial. Fed’s Dec meeting looms The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates for the third time this year at its December meeting. However, the bigger question here remains what’s next for 2025. While a 0.25% rate cut is likely in December, doubts are growing about how quickly the Fed will lower rates next year. Recent economic data has shown solid growth and sticky inflation. In September, the Fed’s projections indicated four rate cuts for 2025, but markets now forecast only two. The next update comes on December 18, and it could reveal a shift in the outlook. Wall Street economists generally agree that the rapid pace of cuts won’t continue. With the Fed funds rate currently at 4.5%-4.75%, most of the experts agree that it’s restrictive. The debate now centers on how much further easing is necessary while inflation remains sticky. On the other hand, the digital assets market is watching a not ending bull run as Bitcoin is trying to get over the much anticipated $100k milestone. BTC’s 128% year to date (YTD) surge says it all.

On Nov. 29, Turkey’s financial regulator updated its list of companies requesting liquidation, confirming Coinbase withdrew its application. QNB Digital Assets, a division of Turkey’s QNB bank, joined Coinbase in filing for liquidation, marking its closure alongside Bitget, Finceptor, Koinim, Stanfex, and XYZ Technology. Meanwhile, Bitfinex, Bitbns, Bitlo, OKX, and Rain Software are still seeking opportunities in Turkey by applying to provide custody services. These changes have raised the number of companies filing for liquidation in Turkey to 14, while 77 applicants remain in process. Earlier this year, Coinbase joined the race to operate in Turkey’s growing crypto market. However, the reasons for withdrawing its bid remain unclear. A Coinbase spokesperson said that the exchange “continually assesses potential markets for expansion.” “Our strategy remains adaptive to evolving market conditions, regulatory landscapes, and our internal priorities, ensuring we align our efforts with both external developments and Coinbase’s overarching mission,” they added. Binance Ends Turkey Referral Program as Crypto Regulations Tighten In October, rival exchange Binance announced it would end its retail referral program in Turkey to comply with local regulations. Turkey’s crypto market is expanding but comes with challenges like high volatility from the lira’s depreciation. Foreign firms may struggle with unpredictable profitability, unexpected regulations or new taxes that affect their business models. Turkey has tightened its crypto regulations this year.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS.

37122930,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106184,1733122965,"PV installer earns $30,000 through DDB Miner","Let me start by saying that I made over $30,000 in passive income last month. I know, that sounds crazy, right? But I promise you it is 100% real. I used to think that making money while you sleep was something only the super wealthy or tech savvy could do. But it turns out it is totally possible, and I’m here to tell you how I did it,” said Dennis. Dennis has been installing photovoltaic panels for three years, and five years ago he asked his wife a question: “Do we really have to work ourselves to death?” She simply responded: “That’s life.” “To be honest, it was frustrating for me. I didn’t want to work every day and not be able to enjoy the things I love. I bet you feel the same way. We all dream of one day being able to relax, maybe travel or do nothing, without worrying about bills. But living paycheck to paycheck? That’s no fun. I needed a solution, and for me, passive income was the answer”, Dennis stressed. So he started his cloud mining journey in his basement; according to him, he made a fortune. He wanted to promote this simple way of making money and let more people participate. But due to the high cost in the later stage and the lack of a professional maintenance team, he had to end his cloud computing capital journey. Then he accidentally saw the advertisement of DDB Miner in the browser and joined it. When he registered, he received $12. At first, he was skeptical. He signed up for 180 days with the $12 registered and withdrew the funds, only to find that the platform did fulfill its promise and the funds were safe and received immediately. The platform did not deduct any fees from him, and he was relieved. “I started to invest a small amount. So far, I have taken back the funds I wanted. Now I use the commissions I earned to invest repeatedly, so that the commissions can help me earn more commissions.” What are cryptocurrency miners? Are they safe? This is a company founded in 2017. They created a simple and easy-to-use page so that both experienced and inexperienced miners can quickly get started, which also led to a rapid increase in global members to 9 million. So how do we participate in DDB Miner? Just visit the official website, click to register and follow the configuration steps. If you don’t understand, you can watch the tutorial or directly consult the 24-hour online customer service. How much does it cost for DDB Miner to help me make money? Register to earn money, get a $12 gift for free, and get $0.5 for signing in every day. Buying contracts will bring you more profits. DDB Miner has launched a variety of computing power contracts with a daily interest rate of up to 5%. For example, the following contracts pay interest every day: Invest $10,000 to buy $10,000 worth of BTC [BTC-Basic Version]. The contract period is 50 days, and the contract can generate $165 of passive income per day. At expiration, you can get $165 x 50 = $8250 + $10,000 = $18250. Log in to the DDB Miner official website to view more contracts. Affiliate Program Another great source of income is the “affiliate program”. Every time someone clicks on your link to register and invest, you receive a commission. “It’s not that complicated, just create an audience and you can start converting some traffic. It doesn’t cost you anything extra, it’s a win-win situation for everyone”, explains Charlotte. He earns about $5,000 a month just from affiliate investment discounts. He doesn’t even need to have a large following on social media. For example, you share an affiliate link on Tik Tok, YouTube, Facebook, X, Reddit posts or even paid ads.

The loss, blamed on a private key theft, resulted in the actual shedding of 4,500 Bitcoin. Still, the attempt to return the service to normal failed due to the sheer magnitude of the damage sustained by the platform. Transfer of Assets in SBI VC Trade According to a piece of local Asian news, in a bid aimed at customers, DMM Bitcoin is to move, alongside all assets, including the Japanese yen and cryptocurrencies, to SBI VC Trade. This transfer is expected to be done before the end of the financial year which will be March 2025. However, there are some limitations such as including unfiltered margin trading positions in which customers will be allowed to continue holding them but will not be added to the new platform until they close their positions and pay for them also, all fees in the current platform will not be transferable to the new platform. It is inferred that SBI VC Trade, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, will continue to maintain confidentiality for the clients of the DMM Bitcoin. Coordination between the two companies is still in progress and expectations for other details pertaining to the transfer are expected in the near future. Reasons for Closure The hack also identified issues in DMM Bitcoin’s risk management and soon after the company received an improvement order from Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) in September 2024. Although the exchange was able to obtain ¥55 billion from its parent company, DMM.com, to help offset customer losses, the exchange said that continued restrictions on services would deeply inconvenience clients and led to the closure of its business. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Hack Weekly Report: Solana Wallet Breach and DeFi Challenges , Broader Implications This incident goes a long way in explaining why the cryptocurrency business faces significant cybersecurity risks.

37125335,https://invezz.com/?p=2321845,1733122732,iDEGEN raises $1.55 million: what sets it ahead of FET and XRP,"The cryptocurrency landscape is rapidly evolving, with innovative projects striving to carve out their niche in an increasingly competitive market. Among these, iDEGEN , a Solana-based meme coin integrated with an autonomous AI agent, stands out as a unique and promising contender. Trained on the raw and unfiltered insights of the crypto community, iDEGEN blends decentralization, artificial intelligence, and active community engagement in a groundbreaking manner. Since its launch on November 26, 2024, the project has garnered impressive investor attention, raising over $1.55 million during its presale phase. With its real-time adaptability and dynamic pricing model, iDEGEN is not just challenging traditional perceptions of meme coins but is also outperforming established competitors like Fetch.ai (FET) and Ripple’s XRP, signaling its potential to disrupt the market. Why iDEGEN surpasses FET in AI innovation Fetch.ai (FET), often recognized for its utility in decentralized machine learning, has achieved substantial gains, trading at $1.82 and breaking key resistance levels. However, iDEGEN offers a distinct edge by introducing a community-driven AI model that evolves in real-time. While FET focuses on providing tools for automated solutions, iDEGEN stands out as an AI agent that interacts directly with the community via social platforms, creating a “sentient meme lord” that responds dynamically to every mention, comment, and interaction. Moreover, FET’s advancements rely heavily on pre-set algorithms, whereas iDEGEN’s AI develops organically through continuous feedback loops from its users. This decentralized and unpredictable approach makes iDEGEN not only innovative but also more engaging for the average crypto enthusiast. Its adaptability adds an element of unpredictability that resonates deeply with the community, which values high-risk, high-reward ventures. iDEGEN eclipses XRP in market appeal and growth potential Ripple’s XRP boasts a strong market presence, currently valued at $2.42 with a market cap of $122 billion. Its trajectory remains largely tied to regulatory developments and institutional partnerships, which can limit its grassroots appeal. In contrast, iDEGEN has captured the imagination of the crypto community by combining meme culture with cutting-edge technology. Unlike XRP, which is designed for cross-border payments, iDEGEN leverages blockchain and AI to offer a unique investment experience. Its dynamic pricing model adjusts every five minutes, reflecting real-time market activity. This innovative mechanism mimics the volatility of the broader crypto market, attracting traders looking for quick gains. The promise of a 10% price increase upon listing on major exchanges offers further incentives for early adopters, positioning iDEGEN as a high-growth opportunity in a competitive space. The strength of iDEGEN lies in its community-centric approach. Its AI continuously evolves based on user interactions, allowing the project to maintain high levels of engagement and relevance. In comparison, FET and XRP are largely governed by their respective foundations, which can limit the level of direct user involvement in shaping the project’s trajectory. By empowering its users to effectively “raise” the AI, iDEGEN fosters a sense of ownership and participation that is unparalleled in the crypto ecosystem.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogwifhat’s bullish breakout and Lunex Network’s explosive presale momentum signal major opportunities in the crypto market, with both tokens poised for significant growth. Table of Contents Lunex Network aims at reshaping blockchain scalability Dogwifhat: Will WIF hit $10? Can LNEX price movement outshine WIF price performance? Dogwifhat has shown a strong market pattern following its Coinbase listing and a key technical breakout on the Solana network. Despite its 35% dip from its ATH, a bullish flag pattern on the WIF daily chart suggests a potential price recovery that could see the token aim for massive breakouts. Historically, such a pattern usually signals a bullish continuation trend, which suggests that Dogwifhat’s price performance might bounce back from its correction period. Moreover, a new presale gem, Lunex Network , has continued with its significant presale momentum to record a new all-time high of $0.0033. This recent surge will attract more investors as the hybrid DeFi project aims to gain more in the coming weeks. Lunex Network aims at reshaping blockchain scalability One of the main issues traders usually face is a lack of interoperability, which is associated with most conventional centralized exchanges. On most trading platforms, trading assets requires clunky and long-winded processes that involve connecting third-party wallets. Lunex Network has tackled this issue by leveraging smart contract technology to power seamless trades, allowing quick asset swaps across more than 50k assets at the lowest fees possible. Lunex Network also distinguishes itself from other exchanges by focusing on security and privacy. The project has eliminated KYC requirements for its users, allowing an anonymous trading experience. Its Lunex Pro feature, a subscription service offering traders extra benefits such as cashback and anti-money laundering checks on their wallet addresses, also makes the project stand out among investors. The Lunex Pro aims to provide various tools and benefits to institutional and retail investors, promoting widespread adoption, which could lead to a further increase in the LNEX price. The token is currently at $0.0033, representing a 175% surge from its starting price of $0.0012. You might also like: Utility tokens to Watch: BNB, XRP, and Lunex Network look set for major gains Dogwifhat: Will WIF hit $10? Dogwifhat’s price has broken out of a falling channel to record bullish momentum. The WIF token’s support level, formed by a broken upper trendline, is critical for the next rally. Moreover, its technical indicators also support a bullish continuation, with the RSI at 55, pointing out a building buying pressure that might help sustain upward momentum. During its recent dip, large holders of the Dogwifhat token have been accumulating, which suggests confidence from institutional investors. This accumulation has led to a bullish signal with a 5% weekly surge to trade along the $3.00 and $3.20 region . According to Cryptonary , Dogwifhat holds the potential to become the first dog-themed meme coin to hit $100 plus. According to the WIF price forecast, its uptrend momentum is set to push Dogwifhat to the $10 region by the end of 2024. This will represent an over 230% rally, making Dogwifhat an attractive token. The current sentiment for the meme coin is optimistic, as the Fear and Greed Index shows 78, which is extreme greed. Dogwifhat has also recorded 13 out of 30 green days with price volatility of just 19% over the past month. Can LNEX price movement outshine WIF price performance? Like Dogwifhat, Lunex Network has the full potential to join the ranks of major players in the DeFi space. Its top features and unique revenue-sharing model make it stand out. This has led to an impressive presale performance, hitting over $3.7m in revenue. Industry experts also project explosive growth of 1,800% by the end of its presale.

The security breach, described by the company as an “unauthorized leak,” occurred on May 30, compromising a private key linked to a wallet containing over 4,500 Bitcoin.

In July, blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggested that the Lazarus Group, a North Korean-linked cybercrime organization, was likely behind the DMM Bitcoin hack. He noted similarities in laundering techniques and off-chain activity, with approximately $35 million of the stolen funds traced to shady platforms like Huione Guarantee. DMM Bitcoin was launched in 2018 by the e-commerce conglomerate DMM Group. The company recently discontinued its Seamoon Protocol, a Web3 gaming and anime content project, citing rapid changes in the business environment. It had also been working with Progmat to launch a stablecoin but shelved the initiative due to similar challenges. Attacks on Major Centralized Exchanges The DMM Bitcoin hack is part of a broader trend of increasing attacks on centralized exchanges in 2024. Other major incidents this year include the $235 million breach of India’s WazirX exchange in July, a $52 million hack on Singapore’s BingX in September, and a $55 million exploit of Turkey’s BtcTurk in June. More recently, XT.com, a Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange, paused withdrawals following reports of a suspected $1.7 million hack . Last week, U.S. federal prosecutors charged five individuals in connection with a sophisticated hacking operation that allegedly stole $11 million in crypto and sensitive data from individuals and companies across multiple countries. According to court filings, the alleged hackers targeted at least 29 individuals, with one victim losing over $6.3 million in cryptocurrency after their email and digital wallets were compromised. Prosecutors claim the group also targeted 45 companies in the U.S., Canada, India, and the United Kingdom. Among their targets was a U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange whose employees were tricked by fake text messages into divulging sensitive credentials.

The post was directed at Shibtoshi, the founder of SquidGrow, and triggered a mixed reaction, highlighting tensions within the ecosystem over the project’s progress and communication strategies. The controversy began when Shibtoshi claimed to have burned 1 billion SHIB tokens within an hour, a move intended to reduce the token’s circulating supply and bolster its value. Kusama responded by expressing excitement at the prospect of a burn from “the billion-dollar wallet” but quickly dismissed the idea, stating, “Oh… it didn’t? That wallet is still frozen in time? Ok, back to work then.” I am so excited to hear that a burn came from the billion dollar wallet, pre-announced. Oh…it didn't? That wallet is still frozen in time? Ok, back to work then. — Shytoshi Kusama (@ShytoshiKusama) November 30, 2024 This comment appeared to mock the notion of significant burns coming from sources that the community might overestimate. While some community members found the response amusing, others criticized it as dismissive and unconstructive, especially given ongoing concerns about the slow pace of SHIB burns. Shibtoshi’s Burn and Its Impact Shibtoshi’s 1 billion SHIB burn was seen as a proactive step to support the SHIB ecosystem. According to reports, the burn was executed quickly, removing a substantial SHIB from circulation. While the move was welcomed as a positive contribution by some SHIB holders, some in the community challenged the Shiba Inu team to do more to address the ecosystem issues. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Some community members also called on Kusama to match the donation, while Shibtoshi received significant praise from SHIB community members. Shibtoshi, who has been vocal about his support for Shiba Inu, has increasingly positioned himself as a figure influencing the community. His actions, including the significant burn, have highlighted frustrations within the SHIB Army regarding the perceived lack of urgency from the project’s leadership in implementing large-scale burns. This burn also drew calls from the community for Kusama to stop avoiding Shibtoshi. The exchange between Kusama and Shibtoshi has again brought the Shiba Inu team’s leadership under scrutiny. Critics argue that while burns are being executed, the scale remains insufficient to meet the expectations of SHIB holders hoping for significant price impacts. However, many in the community are optimistic, as Shiba Inu remains the largest ERC-20 token . SHIB has risen by over 52% this month to its current price of $0.00002984.

BNB (BNB) Bulls Eyeing Breakout Over the past week, the BNB price has seen a clear rise of more than 5% . The BNB price has, however, been in a consolidation period between $690 and $590. Still, BNB’s (BNB) optimistic momentum is strong, particularly following a dramatic fall below $550 earlier in November. The recent climb above $680 indicates that BNB (BNB) is trying to overcome notable opposition. With the MACD, Momentum Oscillator, and Moving Averages all pointing strong buy opportunities on the BNB price chart , technical indicators are backing the good projection for the altcoin. According to the BNB price chart , the altcoin may keep rising and possibly hit the $800 mark if it can pass beyond the $680 resistance zone. Coupled with the favorable technical signs, the recent consolidation phase experienced by BNB (BNB) offers an interesting chance for investors hoping to profit from a significant rally because a bullish breakout could occur at any time. TRON’s (TRX) Bullish Momentum Builds With a startling 21% increase indicating great bullish momentum, the TRON price has been on a strong upward path over the past month. Often indicating a continuous trend in the same bullish direction , the TRON price has been establishing higher highs and higher lows. Currently testing the crucial $0.22 resistance zone, the TRON price chart shows some rejection for the altcoin. Should the bullish trend continue, TRON (TRX) may shortly break past this level and target a new all-time high (ATH). TRON’s (TRX) positive view is still clear with modest gains of more than 2% in the previous week and a strong 50% green day’s record over the past 30 days. Price forecasts for 2025 indicate a likely trading range between $0.19 and $0.40 for TRON (TRX). Together with the bullish technical indicators like the MACD and Moving Averages, the current structure on the TRON price chart supports the conviction that the altcoin could have significant increases in the next few months. The expectation for a possible comeback keeps growing as investors monitor intently for signals of a breakout above the $0.22 resistance. Lunex Network Could Outpace BNB and TRON Lunex Network is quietly establishing itself as a game-changer in the DeFi space as BNB (BNB) and TRON (TRX) keep displaying great optimistic momentum. Lunex Network is one of the best candidates for future expansion with its creative cross-chain features, cheap transaction costs, and privacy and security dedication.

This week’s economic data is primarily focused on employment and jobs, but there are also some manufacturing PMI reports in the mix. This will be the last week of labor market data before the Dec. 18 Federal Reserve meeting, reported the Kobeissi Letter, which added, “It’s a huge week for the labor market.” Economic Events Dec. 2 to 6 Stock and crypto markets were buoyed last week as investors found reassurance in Donald Trump’s pick for the Treasury secretary position, choosing seasoned hedge fund executive Scott Bessent. However, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, Core PCE, came in hot at 2.8%, causing some jitters about increasing inflation and a hawkish pivot from the US central bank. A strong economy, as seen through last week’s GDP data, and persistently high inflation, has raised questions among investors as to whether to expect another rate cut this year. Monday will see November’s ISM Manufacturing PMI report released reflecting business conditions in the US manufacturing sector. It provides a leading indicator for assessing the state of the economy and anticipating changing trends. Tuesday has the latest job openings data, while Wednesday will show November’s nonfarm employment data. Wednesday also has November’s ISM Services PMI, which shows business conditions in the US services sector. PMIs are leading indicators for changes in economic conditions. Friday has more jobs data, with nonfarm payrolls and unemployment rate reports. These reports are two of the most important economic indicators for policymakers following shifts in the number of positions since they are strongly associated with overall economic health. Friday also has the preliminary readings of December’s Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index and Consumer Inflation Expectations. These reports provide the results of a monthly survey of consumer confidence levels and views of long-term inflation. Key Events This Week: 1. November ISM Manufacturing PMI data – Monday 2.

Crypto Market Surges Crypto markets continued to gain over the weekend, with total capitalization reaching a record high of $3.65 trillion in early trading in Asia on Monday morning. Bitcoin inched higher to reclaim $98,000 before retracing again, but Ethereum was the driving force, tapping a six-month high of $3,750 on Dec. 2. XRP also exploded more than 30% to reach a six-year high of $2.48 on Monday morning. Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Stellar (XLM) were also seeing solid gains.

Over the past 24 hours, XRP surged by 30%, reclaiming its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, while Hedera skyrocketed by 44%, making it the top gainer. With the global crypto market capitalization surpassing $3.49 trillion and trading volumes rising sharply, investors remain optimistic about the market’s momentum. Here’s a detailed breakdown of today’s key crypto price movements and trends. Bitcoin inches toward $100K Bitcoin (BTC) continues its steady climb, trading at $96,200—a 2% increase in the last 24 hours. The flagship cryptocurrency fluctuated between $96,253 and $98,152, reflecting sustained investor interest. BTC’s market capitalization stands at $1.93 trillion, accounting for 55.4% of the total market. However, Bitcoin’s dominance has slightly declined as altcoins attract more attention. Source: CoinMarketcap XRP surges by 30%, reclaims third spot by market cap XRP has emerged as the star performer, surging 30% to reach $2.42, with a daily range between $1.85 and $2.49. This remarkable rally has pushed XRP’s market cap to $137 billion, surpassing Tether and Solana. XRP now holds a 4% market dominance, showcasing its growing influence in the crypto ecosystem. Hedera leads the charge with a 44% rally Hedera (HBAR) recorded the highest gains among cryptocurrencies, surging by 44% to $0.25. The altcoin’s 24-hour low and high were $0.16 and $0.24, respectively. Analysts predict further upside potential for HBAR, with some forecasting a possible 192% rally shortly. Hedera’s rapid growth underscores increasing confidence in its blockchain technology and market potential. Source: CoinMarketcap Ethereum and Solana show modest gains Ethereum (ETH) climbed 2% to trade at $3,751, with its market cap reaching $452 billion. ETH’s trading range for the day was $3,679 to $3,761, reflecting stable growth. Solana (SOL), on the other hand, saw a slight dip of 1%, trading at $234. Despite minor fluctuations, Solana has maintained a strong position in the market, with a market cap of $111 billion. Its trading volume of $3.91 billion highlights continued investor interest. Meme coins rebound with significant gains Meme coins are back in the spotlight, with Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) posting impressive gains. DOGE rose by 8%, trading at $0.45, while SHIB climbed to $0.00003108. Other meme tokens like PEPE and BONK also recorded gains between 3% and 8%, reflecting renewed interest among retail investors. Top losers: Core and Ethena face setbacks Not all cryptocurrencies rode the bullish wave. Core (CORE) dropped by 12% to $1.57, while Ethena (ENA) fell by 6%, trading at $0.82. These declines highlight the mixed performance of certain altcoins amidst an overall bullish market trend. The Fear and Greed Index stands at 82, signaling extreme greed as investors pour into the market. The global crypto market cap rose by 3%, while trading volume increased by 10% to $170 billion. Analysts attribute the bullish momentum to strong altcoin performances and Bitcoin’s approach to the $100K psychological level. As the market remains optimistic, all eyes are on whether Bitcoin can break the $100K barrier and if altcoins can sustain their rally. The coming days will likely set the tone for the next phase of the crypto market’s growth.

The token surpassed giants like Solana, BinanceCoin, and Tether, indicating a strong bullish momentum towards the crypto. Multiple factors have driven the XRP price rally, such as legal optimism, ETF speculation, and a strong rise in trading activity, particularly in the South Korean exchanges. Alongside this, whale movements have reached highs, with billions of tokens being transferred here and there and another billion being unlocked. As per the data from Whale Alert, more than 2 billion XRP tokens have been unlocked from Ripple’s escrow in the past 24 hours. Besides, over a billion XRP have been transferred from other unknown wallets to Ripple and exchanges like Binanace & Upbit. The unlock from the escrow is a scheduled event to manage supply and support the ecosystem, which has historically not caused any major disruptions within the market but triggers the XRP price volatility. The price has launched a 300% rise in the past few days, regardless of the choppy behaviour of other popular tokens like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Therefore, now that the market participants have become bullish on XRP, the question arises whether the price will mark a new ATH at $5 before the end of 2024. The recent price action suggests the price has gained enough momentum with the volume reaching above $28 billion, 18% more than the 2021 bull run volume. This indicates the bulls have shifted their focus onto the token, and hence a new ATH could be imminent. The monthly chart of the XRP price offers a ‘Dejavu’ moment as it underwent a similar price action. After a couple of prolonged accumulations, the price has triggered a breakout, and hence the outcome is also expected to mirror the previous rally. With this, the possibility of the XRP price smashing a 2-digit figure and reaching the first pitstop at $11 appears to be highly viable. However, it appears to be an interim target, as the real bull run to $30 may succeed if the XRP price follows the previous pattern, marking the top of the ongoing run.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/xrp-marks-a-6-year-high-smashes-2-5-heres-the-xrp-price-prediction-for-december-2024-after-a-300-rise/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

This impressive rally pushed XRP past USDT, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. However, currently trading around $2.42, XRP has seen a remarkable 70% weekly rise and a massive 377% increase over the past month. But here’s what is driving the XRP price Up. Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Awaits NYDFS Approval One of the biggest contributors to XRP’s surge is the news surrounding Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin. Reports suggest that the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) might soon approve RLUSD, with Ripple planning a December 4 launch. If approved, this would allow Ripple to enter New York’s strict digital finance market, enhancing its position in the stablecoin ecosystem. Ripple aims to position RLUSD as a competitor to major stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC. Acting as a liquidity bridge within Ripple’s network, RLUSD would work alongside XRP to strengthen Ripple’s global payment offerings. Growing Optimism for an XRP ETF Another factor boosting XRP’s price is growing anticipation for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. With hopes for a more crypto-friendly environment under a potential Trump administration, major players like Bitwise Invest, 21Shares, and Canary Funds have already joined the race by filing for XRP-spot ETFs . WisdomTree recently submitted its application, further fueling excitement in the market. Ripple Wins & Gary Gensler Exit Ripple’s recent legal win against the SEC has also reignited investor confidence. The court’s decision that XRP is not a security in most cases has set a precedent for the entire crypto industry. Adding to this is the announcement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation , set for January 2025. His exit might impact Ripple’s ongoing legal challenges, potentially inclining the ruling in Ripple’s favor. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP News: Ripple Lawsuit and Market Momentum Push XRP Price Back in Top 3 Crypto , XRP Price Forecast XRP is showing strong growth as the cryptocurrency market recovers.

37123258,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51145,1733119991,Expert Says Buying XRP Now Is Like Buying Bitcoin Below $100,"XRP has been making headlines as its price continues to climb, supported by favorable market developments and investors’ optimism. At the time of press, XRP is trading at $2.44, representing a 31% increase over the past 24 hours. Edoardo Farina, a prominent figure in the crypto community and CEO of Alpha Lions Academy, recently made a bold comparison between XRP and Bitcoin in its early days. According to Farina, buying XRP now is like buying Bitcoin when it was at $100. His prediction implies that XRP has the potential for substantial growth, similar to Bitcoin’s meteoric rise to its recent all-time high of $99,655. Based on this assumption, XRP could theoretically increase by approximately 100,000%, reaching $1,892. Is XRP About to Enter the Four-digit Price Range? Farina’s statement has sparked significant debate within the cryptocurrency community. Skeptics have pointed out the substantial differences between Bitcoin and XRP, particularly in terms of market capitalization. One user noted , “Bitcoin below $100 wasn’t 100 billion in market cap.” Another stated , “XRP will not be Bitcoin.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Despite the criticism, many XRP supporters remain optimistic. Notably, other experts have compared an XRP purchase to Bitcoin’s early days when it was worth almost nothing and there are many reasons why these experts are bullish on the digital asset. Gary Gensler, the current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has announced that he will step down on January 20, 2024. This would allow the new administration led by Donald Trump to appoint a crypto-friendly SEC Chair. This would effectively end the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC and the many other lawsuits the SEC has filed against cryptocurrency companies. Gensler’s announcement contributed to the recent price surge, as many investors anticipate regulatory clarity and potentially favorable rulings for Ripple. Additionally, the application for multiple XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has fueled bullish sentiment further. Other experts have predicted targets above $1,000 for XRP. The digital asset is currently in territory it has not reached in years, and if it can keep its current momentum into 2025, these targets could become more realistic.

Thanks to this, bullish predictions are flooding in, with targets as high as $250,000 in 2024 and $13 million long-term. Market dynamics, institutional adoption, and liquidity expansion are driving this optimism. Other macroeconomic events, like a potential Bitcoin reserve under Trump, fuel bullish sentiment even more. Meanwhile, Solv Protocol plans to transform Bitcoin into an active DeFi asset, inspired by MicroStrategy’s strategy of leveraging Bitcoin for yield and corporate growth. Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Bitcoin Correction to 60K Robert Kiyosaki, the well known author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, shared a bold prediction regarding Bitcoin (BTC), and suggested that its price may ”crash” to as low as $60,000. Despite this big potential downturn, Kiyosaki is still optimistic and unfazed. He sees such a correction as a buying opportunity, and stated that he will not sell but instead acquire more Bitcoin during the dip. At press time, Bitcoin is trading hands at $97,561, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The crypto recently reached an all-time high on Nov. 22 before experiencing a minor pullback to $90,742. This price movement reignited discussions about Bitcoin’s volatility and long-term potential. BTC’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) While some, like Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, believe Bitcoin is unlikely to fall below $80,000, Kiyosaki’s outlook focuses less on short-term price fluctuations and more on accumulation. He stated that at this stage, the number of Bitcoin held matters more than its immediate price. Kiyosaki also previously expressed his support for ultra-bullish predictions, like MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor’s projection of Bitcoin reaching $13 million. Additionally, he recently referenced an unidentified AI model predicting Bitcoin will hit $500,000 by 2025. $150K Bitcoin Possible by Copying 2023 Performance Other Bitcoin predictions even suggest that the crypto could reach $250,000 in 2024 or hit $150,000 simply by replicating its 2023 price performance. Tom Lee, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, shared in an interview with Wealthion that Bitcoin's price cycles, especially those linked to block subsidy halving events, support these ambitious targets. According to Lee, the ”sweet spot” of Bitcoin’s bull run has already started, with the supply cut effects expected to drive massive price growth over the next year. Lee also pointed to a potential game-changer under a new U.S. administration, and suggested that a Bitcoin reserve strategy could lend some much needed legitimacy to the cryptocurrency. By drawing parallels with MicroStrategy, Lee mentioned how adopting Bitcoin as a balance-sheet asset generated immense value for the company’s shareholders. Lee is not the only one who sees massive potential in Bitcoin as commentators like The Bitcoin Therapist echoed a similar sentiment on social media. Meanwhile, other analysts are equally bullish. Trader Dave The Wave believed that Bitcoin could realistically reach $150,000 by mirroring its 186% gain between October of 2023 and March of 2024. He described this price surge as entirely feasible, especially given the current market dynamics and Bitcoin's historical performance. The combination of cyclical supply dynamics, institutional strategies, and market sentiment proves that there is a growing confidence in the cryptocurrency's potential for reaching six-figure valuations in the near future. Bitcoin in Its ‘Parabolic Phase’ Bitcoin is also entering what analysts describe as the ” parabolic phase ” of its current market cycle, with projections suggesting a potential local top of over $110,000 before the end of January. This optimistic forecast aligns with its correlation to the Global Macro Investor’s Total Liquidity Index, which aggregates the balance sheets of major central banks. According to Raoul Pal , CEO of Global Macro Investor, this price level is just a local peak for Bitcoin, with its right-hand side (RHS) potentially peaking in January 2025 before a correction below $70,000 by February. The expected dip is seen as temporary, driven by an ”interim peak in liquidity,” with liquidity projected to continue increasing into the third quarter of 2025. Historically, growing money supply was a major catalyst for Bitcoin's price. Bitget Wallet’s COO, Alvin Kan , pointed out that liquidity injections from the Federal Reserve typically create favorable market conditions for risk assets like Bitcoin as it spurs investor interest and inflows into the crypto market. Other analysts, including Jamie Coutts of Real Vision, suggested that Bitcoin’s price could reach over $132,000 during the year, fueled by the increasing money supply . Historical patterns also indicate that Bitcoin could absorb up to 10% of the new liquidity, which could potentially attract $2 trillion in investments as the global liquidity pool is predicted to expand by $20 trillion. Coutts did warn that Bitcoin cycles sometimes deviate from linear projections, leaving room for even higher price targets. Bitcoin’s rally has also been influenced by broader macroeconomic and political events. Donald Trump’s victory in the recent U.S. presidential election boosted risk appetite in financial markets, and created even more momentum for Bitcoin. Analysts from Bitfinex predict that the new administration's supportive regulatory stance could lead to new all-time highs for cryptocurrencies in 2025. Speculation about the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve under the Trump administration fueled this optimism even more. Blockstream CEO Adam Back suggested that such a move could drive Bitcoin’s price toward $1 million. On-chain MicroStrategy? Solv Protocol is set to launch what it describes as an ”on-chain MicroStrategy,” to transform Bitcoin from a passive store of value into an active asset in decentralized finance (DeFi). Co-founder Ryan Chow announced the initiative, and described it as a transparent and permissionless platform that is designed to strategically manage Bitcoin reserves. The goal is to preserve wealth while still generating yield and amplifying returns, though specifics on exactly how this will be achieved remain unclear. As a Bitcoin staking platform, Solv offers a variety of yield strategies across multiple blockchain networks, leveraging Bitcoin layer-2s like Babylon and CoreChain, and DeFi protocols like Jupiter and Ethena. Currently, the platform oversees more than $3 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to data from DefiLlama . This move draws inspiration from MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm that has become synonymous with large-scale Bitcoin investments. Since 2020, MicroStrategy pivoted toward Bitcoin accumulation under the leadership of Michael Saylor, and established itself as a de-facto Bitcoin hedge fund. The company’s shares soared by over 450% in 2024 alone thanks to its innovative approach to leveraging its balance sheet for Bitcoin acquisitions. MSTR Bitcoin holdings (Source: MSTR Tracker ) MicroStrategy’s strategy includes the concept of Bitcoin yield, which measures the ratio of BTC holdings to outstanding shares, effectively tying corporate performance to Bitcoin accumulation. The firm also plans to raise $42 billion through equity and debt as part of its ambitious “21/21 Plan,” aiming for a projected Bitcoin yield of 12.7% by 2025. Solv’s effort to replicate this model in DeFi could bridge traditional finance strategies and blockchain innovation. This could position Bitcoin as a much more dynamic and versatile asset in decentralized ecosystems.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6329/robert-kiyosaki-sees-bitcoin-crash-to-60k-as-a-chance-to-buy-more,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png
37121314,https://nulltx.com/?p=135058,1733119850,THETA NETWORK PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (December 2) – Theta Looks Strong Weekly Despite Current Drops But Can It Advance Higher?,"Closing last month on a strong bullish note, Theta looks weak today as it starts a new month on a loss. It is likely to enter a correction mode if the price drops daily, though the trend is still bullish. As low-cap altcoins take the stage this week while Bitcoin decides the next move, Theta continued to show strength and exploded massively to a new multi-month high of $3.2 during the November rally. The rally was intercepted today being the first day of December, and as we can see on the daily chart, the price is currently down after a week of consistent increase, showing signs of weakness from the buying side. Despite that, the bulls are still in charge from a short-term perspective. We can expect more rallies if they show strong commitment in the next few hours. Otherwise, the crypto may correct lower before climbing back. Technically, this should provide a little discount in the market. So far, Theta has seen a significant recovery from where it was trading in the past month. While there’s still room for massive growth in the long term, the price must break above March’s high before considering a massive upsurge. All in all, it remains bullish on the daily timeframe. THETA’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview If the bulls counter the latest drop with a push above the recent rejected high, the next target level would be $3.82 – March’s high. A break up from there should send the price to $4 and $5 in no time. The potential support level to watch for the ongoing sell is $2.56. If the price drops below it, Theta may pull back to the $2.06 and $1.66 support before bouncing back. Key Resistance Levels: $3.82, $4, $5 Key Support Levels: $2.56, $2.06, $1.66 Spot Price: $2.89 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Speaking on CNN's Inside Politics today, Wood said reducing regulatory burdens could help the U.S. regain its position as a global leader in innovation. “The U.S. has almost lost ground in the crypto space,” Wood said, attributing the situation to overregulation during SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s tenure. He added that the Trump administration’s expected regulatory overhaul could spur growth in emerging sectors like crypto and artificial intelligence, allowing the country to regain a leadership position similar to its dominance during the early internet era.

Cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence, as well as other transformative technologies such as robotics, energy storage and multiomics sequencing, are also critical platforms that the U.S. must “seize and exploit,” Wood said. Asked about Trump’s proposed tariffs on trading partners, Wood agreed with the approach, saying it made “some sense” if it was balanced with tax cuts to maintain competitiveness. Wood also commented on the potential impact of Trump's return on the stock market, predicting a shift away from the concentrated gains seen in recent years toward broader growth opportunities. “We’ve seen a huge concentration in a very small number of stocks over the last four years,” he said. “I think the market is going to expand right now and reward companies that are at the forefront of innovation.” That broader growth could particularly benefit small and medium-sized businesses, Wood said. *This is not investment advice.

It broke higher and appears super bullish on the day. In November, Shiba saw few gains compared to other top meme coins like Doge, Pepe, and Bonk, which rallied hard within a few weeks. It posted small gains and quickly took a bullish break after testing the $0.00003 level. That break brought a three-week retracement and the price dropped near $0.00002. Holding this price level as support, it bounced back but no enough buying volume to bring the bulls back in action and the month ended indecisively. Starting this month on a strong note following a rising demand, trading volatility increased and the price exploded massively following the latest price break. The price is now looking strong again as it sits well above $0.000031 at the time of writing. The main obstacle for the bulls right now is the $0.000046 level, tested in March. Once they manage to push through, we should anticipate a major run from a long-term perspective. A drop from the current trading level could bring a slight retest before resuming bullish. Leading today’s meme coins rally, Shiba is up 30% in the past week as it makes a new shift. It is currently looking bullish on the daily chart. Shiba’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview On the way up, Shiba is facing a minor resistance at $0.000033 while the main resistance sits at $0.0000457. A break out there should skyrocket the price to $0.00006. In case of a drop, $0.00003 is the closest level to consider for support, followed by the $0.000023 level. Lower support levels for drops are $0.000016 and $0.0000125. Key Resistance Levels: $0.000033, $0.0000457, $0.00006 Key Support Levels: $0.000023, $0.000016, $0.0000125 Spot Price: $0.000032 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Now, the cryptocurrency's price chart reveals a compelling pattern reminiscent of the set-up in bitcoin (BTC) before it chalked out a record rally last month.  Ether's three-line break chart, which filters out day-to-day noise and erratic price movements, shows the cryptocurrency's eight-month corrective trend, characterized by lower highs and lower lows, has ended and the broader uptrend from the October 2023 lows near $1,500 has resumed.  Such breakouts often trigger a bullish cascading effect on price by attracting new buyers and forcing out sellers that restricted price rallies during consolidation.  Bitcoin witnessed a similar breakout in mid-October, signaling a rally to the then-record highs above $73,000. BTC has since surged 45% to over $96,000, according to data source TradingView and CoinDesk.  While traders track price patterns to gauge trend strength and changes, they don't always work as intended and fundamental factors can single-handedly make or break trends.  That said, the recent activity on the ethereum network supports the bullish case in ETH. The number of ""blobs"" posted on the Ethereum network by the layer 2 protocols surged in November. Posting blobs incurs fluctuating fees paid in ether, which are burned like regular transaction fees, taking out ETH's supply from the market.  Meanwhile, mainstream investor interest in the token is rising. On Friday, the nine spot ether ETFs listed in the U.S. accumulated $332.9 million in inflows, the highest single tally since inception, according to Farside Investors.

37120926,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620891,1733118789,"Crypto ETFs hit record highs: $6.5B for Bitcoin, $1.1B for Ether","The demand for US exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to the biggest digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) has reached unprecedented levels fueled by President-elect Trump’s pro-crypto stance. The bullish sentiment peaking can be directly seen in the rising Bitcoin price. The cumulative digital assets market cap jumped marginally over the day to stand at $3.43 trillion. Its 24 hour trading volume spiked by 18% to hit the $181 billion mark. Analysts suggest that the Bitcoin balance of the crypto exchange is drying up amid high buying pressure. Ether ETFs attracted $466M last week According to reports , November 2024 saw Bitcoin ETFs attracting $6.5 billion in net inflows, while Ether ETFs garnered $1.1 billion. These figures represent all-time highs for both assets as crypto bulls took over after much anticipated Donald Trump’s US Presidential election win. With a Bitcoin surge , a climbing interest in Ether signals a growing speculative appetite for crypto. On Nov 29, nine Ether ETFs recorded a $333 million net inflow, with major players like BlackRock and Fidelity leading the charge. BlackRock’s ETHA has seen a cumulative inflow of $2.10 billion of inflow till now. Data provided by SosoValue shows that Ether ETFs pulled in over $466 million in the last week of November, while it saw an outflow of $71.60 million in the prior week. ETH price surged by 48% in the last 7 days. The biggest altcoin is trading at an average price of $3,691, at the press time. Bitcoin approached $100K in November but couldn’t make it through. However, Ether has outperformed Bitcoin since Trump’s election, though it has yet to hit new highs. BTC is trading at an average price of $96,892, at the press time. At the moment, XRP is printing huge green indexes as investors anticipate a reversal of the SEC crackdown. Some firms are already looking to launch XRP-focused ETFs. Trump has vowed to overhaul regulatory approaches, remove restrictions, and build more crypto-friendly policies. XRP price is up by 376% in the last 30 days. Ripple’s native crypto is trading at an average price of $2.44, at the press time. It is now the 3rd biggest crypto asset with a market cap of over $140 billion. Bitcoin balances on exchanges declining? Markus Thielen suggested in a post that Bitcoin balances on exchanges are rapidly decreasing, with no large inflows replenishing inventory as seen earlier this year. Only three exchanges—Bitfinex, Binance, and Coinbase currently have sufficient Bitcoin inventory, he added. Recent inflows into Bitcoin have been substantial which indicates that a bearish outlook is premature. Bitcoin is not only a topic at Thanksgiving dinners, but it’s also set to be a key discussion point during Christmas. He highlighted that the crypto market capitalization has now reached $3.43 trillion, with BTC’s dominance decreasing from 60% to 56%. This shift may signal the beginning of altcoin season, a phenomenon often driven by market sentiment. Since Trump’s election, the crypto market has seen a $1.2 trillion surge. This rally, building on the momentum of pro-crypto policies, is revitalizing the sector after the 2021 downturn.

In a presentation shared on December 1 , Saylor mentioned the transformative potential of Bitcoin, asserting that Microsoft must seize the opportunity to lead in the next technological wave. “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next technology wave, and Bitcoin is that wave,” he declared. Saylor Prposes Microsoft Converts its Cash Flows into Bitcoin Saylor proposed that Microsoft convert its cash flows, dividend payouts, stock buybacks, and debt into Bitcoin, predicting significant financial rewards for shareholders. “If you do that, you’ll add hundreds of dollars to the stock price,” he argued, adding that this move could create trillions of dollars in enterprise value while reducing shareholder risks. According to Saylor’s analysis, Bitcoin could potentially add up to $584 per share to Microsoft’s stock price over the next decade. This assumes a scenario where Bitcoin’s value reaches $1.7 million by 2034, with Microsoft investing all its treasury and financial resources into the cryptocurrency. This strategy, Saylor claimed, could elevate Microsoft’s market cap by $4.9 trillion. Currently valued at $3.18 trillion, Microsoft ranks as the third most valuable company globally, behind Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp.

The cryptocurrency has surged by 120% this year, climbing nearly 40% in the past month alone to approach the $100,000 mark. Since 2020, MicroStrategy has acquired 386,700 Bitcoin for $21.9 billion, an investment now worth approximately $37.6 billion with Bitcoin priced at $97,200. This strategy has propelled MicroStrategy’s stock by 465.5% in 2024, with shares hitting a record high of $421.88 in November. Saylor also highlighted growing public and political support for Bitcoin, describing it as part of a “crypto renaissance.” He pointed to pro-crypto statements from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and the introduction of Bitcoin investment products by major Wall Street firms. Saylor Asks Microsoft to Allocate $100B Annually to Bitcoin In his proposal, Saylor urged Microsoft to allocate $100 billion annually to Bitcoin investments. He argued that buying Bitcoin would be more advantageous than repurchasing company stock or holding bonds. “What if you could buy a $100 billion company growing faster than Microsoft for 1 times revenue?” he asked, underscoring Bitcoin’s potential as a high-growth asset. Saylor concluded his pitch with a rallying call for Microsoft to act decisively. “It’s time for Microsoft to evaluate its Bitcoin strategic options,” he said. “Do the right thing for the world and adopt Bitcoin.” Last week, Brazilian Congressman Eros Biondini introduced a bill proposing the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve. Dubbed the “Reserva Estratégica Soberana de Bitcoins” (RESBit), or Strategic Sovereign Bitcoin Reserve, the proposal seeks to allocate up to 5% of Brazil’s $372 billion in international reserves to Bitcoin. As reported, Texas lawmakers are also exploring launching a strategic Bitcoin reserve , according to the Satoshi Action Fund (SAF), a nonprofit advocacy group.

This marks a major milestone, bringing XRP back to where it was before Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC . Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett recently highlighted XRP’s challenges, noting it was once the second-largest cryptocurrency before the SEC’s 2018 Hinman speech. The speech classified Bitcoin and Ethereum as non-securities, causing XRP to lose its position to Ethereum by November 2018 due to regulatory uncertainty. Documents from the Ripple case, known as the “ Hinman emails ,” revealed internal SEC disagreements about the speech’s impact on other cryptocurrencies. Six years later, XRP’s regulatory status remains unclear, fueling ongoing debates on how cryptocurrencies should be classified. John Deaton’s Legal Battle for XRP’s Fairness Attorney John Deaton has been a key figure in XRP’s legal journey. Reflecting on his battle against the SEC, Deaton revealed that his initial XRP holdings were modest compared to his investments in Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the SEC’s claim that all XRP transactions were illegal motivated him to step up and defend not just Ripple but also XRP’s global users. Deaton highlighted key inconsistencies in the SEC’s actions. In 2014, the U.S. Government Accountability Office classified XRP as a virtual currency. In 2015, FinCEN declared XRP a currency and set compliance rules for Ripple. By 2019, Coinbase listed XRP after thorough legal reviews, and MoneyGram publicly disclosed using XRP in its business. Despite these validations, the SEC filed its lawsuit in December 2020, calling XRP an unregistered security and sending shockwaves through the crypto world. But it’s not just Deaton who supported XRP, the 75000 XRP army also made it possible and stayed strong in all phases of XRP. Many investors have doubled their holdings just to show their confidence in XRP.

XRP Price Surge XRP closed November with a whopping 3x rally, hitting a seven-year high. The crypto remained resilient despite releasing 1 billion tokens, which might concern newcomers unfamiliar with XRP’s tokenomics. After yesterday’s 2.4% dip, XRP has seen a 29% surge today and is currently trading at $2.44. As the new month begins, market watchers are eager to see how XRP performs amid increased trading volumes, suggesting the continuation of its recent momentum. Analysts are hopeful that XRP will see a massive jump in January after Gary Gensler steps down . FAQs What caused XRP’s recent price rally?

37120433,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620845,1733117820,New Insights Show Why This Token Could Outperform SHIB in the Next Bull Run,"As the crypto market gears up for its next bull run, investors are turning their attention to projects with the potential to deliver explosive gains. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been a top performer in previous cycles, new data suggests a rising contender could outshine the popular meme coin. That token is Lightchain AI , a revolutionary blockchain project blending artificial intelligence with decentralized technology. With its innovative approach and growing ecosystem, Lightchain AI is positioned to redefine the market narrative. What Makes Lightchain AI a Stronger Contender Than SHIB? 1. Real-World Utility Over Memes While SHIB owes much of its success to community-driven hype and branding, Lightchain AI’s foundation lies in real-world applications. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism incentivizes meaningful AI computations, enabling applications like machine learning, data analytics, and predictive modeling—all while maintaining scalability and sustainability. 2. Early-Stage Investment Potential SHIB has already experienced its meteoric rise, and while it remains a strong community-driven asset, Lightchain AI is in its presale phase , offering a rare chance to invest at a ground-floor price. Investors who recognized SHIB’s potential early saw life-changing gains, and Lightchain AI provides a similar opportunity for exponential growth. 3. Broader Market Appeal Lightchain AI’s dual focus appeals to a wider range of investors: Enterprise Solutions: Its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) empowers businesses to leverage decentralized AI for critical tasks. Retail Speculators: Features like the upcoming meme coin pump pad position it as a unique platform for high-energy market movements. By catering to both institutional and retail audiences, Lightchain AI combines the best of utility and speculative potential. SHIB’s Strengths and Its Limitations SHIB has earned its place as a top meme coin, boasting a loyal community and expanding utility with its Shibarium Layer 2 solution. However, its value largely depends on speculative sentiment, and many investors are looking for tokens with more tangible use cases in the long term. Key Challenges for SHIB: Market Saturation: The meme coin space is increasingly crowded, making it harder for SHIB to maintain its dominance. Utility Limitations: While its ecosystem is growing, SHIB’s primary value driver remains community hype. Lightchain AI addresses these gaps by combining speculative appeal with technological innovation, offering a more robust investment case. Why Lightchain AI Could Dominate the Next Bull Run Technological Innovation No other project combines blockchain and AI as effectively as Lightchain AI. Its ability to perform AI-specific tasks on-chain opens doors to industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics, creating a vast market for its native token, LCAI. Massive Growth Potential Analysts predict that AI and blockchain integration will be a trillion-dollar market by 2030. By being an early mover in this space, Lightchain AI positions itself for unparalleled adoption and value appreciation. Presale Momentum Lightchain AI’s ongoing presale has already raised significant capital, reflecting strong investor confidence. As it transitions into mainstream trading, early adopters could see exponential returns. Should You Bet on Lightchain AI Over SHIB? While SHIB remains a fan favorite and could perform well in the next bull run, Lightchain AI offers a more compelling investment narrative. Its combination of cutting-edge technology, real-world applications, and early-stage pricing makes it a standout choice for investors seeking both short-term excitement and long-term value. Join the Lightchain AI Revolution With the next bull run on the horizon, there’s no better time to explore projects with the potential to redefine the crypto landscape. Lightchain AI is more than just a token—it’s a movement bridging AI and blockchain for the future. Don’t miss your chance to secure your place in this revolutionary project.

As Bitcoin (BTC) price failed to reach the much-hyped target of $100k in November, investors’ focus has gradually shifted to the altcoin industry in the recent past led by Ethereum (ETH), Ripple’s XRP, Hedera (HBAR), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Solana (SOL), among many others. Major Paradigm Shift in Investing Models According to Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO at CryptoQuant, the ongoing altseason is no longer defined by crypto cash rotation from Bitcoin. Moreover, Bitcoin price has not registered notable cash outflows in the recent past to guarantee a significant spike in large-cap altcoins. Instead, Ju highlighted that the notable altcoin growth is majorly attributed to stablecoin and fiat pairs, which reflects real market growth rather than asset rotation.

37125932,https://cryptonews.com/?p=314908,1733117396,US Was Losing Crypto Leadership Before Trump Win: Cathie Wood,"Ark Invest founder Cathie Wood, known for her stock-picking skills, has indicated she believes the US almost lost its crypto edge before Donald Trump’s reelection. According to her, overregulation remains the country’s biggest obstacle. “We drove a lot of talent away from the United States. We think that’s going to change with a focus on crypto and AI,” she told CNN’s Inside Politics Sunday . She noted five major platforms shaping the world today: crypto, digital assets, robotics, energy storage, and multiomic sequencing. “Those are all technology platforms that the US must seize and harness really, and lead the way, much like we did in the Internet. We were about to lose that given our regulatory system. And I think a change in the regulatory system with both crypto and AI as prime focuses, is going to be quite meaningful.” Trump’s Plan to Expand CFTC Authority Sparks Hopes for Crypto-Friendly Reforms Her perspective is based on Trump’s past economic policies and his recent support for cryptocurrencies, which position him as a digital asset advocate. Wood also noted that a leadership change at the SEC would foster a friendlier climate for digital assets, boost mainstream adoption and drive sector growth. However, under Trump, the SEC’s role might be diminished. His administration plans to expand the CFTC’s role by giving it authority over the digital asset market while cutting back the SEC’s influence. This move aims to reverse regulations implemented during President Biden’s term, especially under outgoing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Further, his transition team is reportedly considering appointing former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo as the administration’s “crypto czar.” The role is expected to focus on shaping US crypto policy and fostering a regulatory framework that supports blockchain and digital asset growth. Cathie Wood Among Several Prominent Digital Asset Advocates That Backed Trump In June, Cathie Wood revealed she would vote for Trump . She referenced economist Arthur Laffer’s claim that Trump’s 2017–2020 economic performance was the strongest in US history, excluding the COVID-19 impact. Wood, a leading crypto advocate, has both personal and professional interests in Bitcoin and digital assets. She views Bitcoin as a key hedge against inflation, especially in countries with unstable currencies.

37120043,https://coinpaper.com/6328/xrp-rally-faces-volatility-risks-as-analysts-warn-of-leverage-impact,1733117376,XRP Rally Faces Volatility Risks as Analysts Warn of Leverage Impact,"The cryptocurrency industry currently stands at a critical crossroads, with influential figures expressing growing concerns regarding the increasing regulatory pressures and the ever-shifting market dynamics. Ripple's Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has openly criticized the controversial Operation Chokepoint 2.0, arguing that it poses a significant threat to civil liberties by implementing indirect forms of regulation that could stifle innovation and freedom in the space. Meanwhile, analysts are sounding alarms about the potential volatility surrounding XRP, especially in light of its recent surge to multi-year highs. XRP Surges to 2021 Highs Amid Leverage Concerns and Market Buzz Ripple’s native token, XRP , has seen an explosive rally, with its price reaching levels not witnessed since 2021. However, analysts warn the surge may be ”leverage-driven,” cautioning traders about potential volatility as open interest in XRP derivatives reaches record levels. In a Dec. 1 post on X, CryptoQuant analyst Maarten Regterschot sounded the alarm on XRP’s open interest, which saw a massive 37% spike in just 24 hours. Open interest measures the total number of active derivatives contracts, such as futures and options, and its sudden increase often precedes heightened price volatility. “Open Interest is up 37% already — watch for volatility. The last similar event led to a -17% drawdown,” Maarten warned. “Stay sharp, manage risk accordingly.” CoinGlass data corroborates Maarten’s analysis, showing that XRP’s open interest has climbed 30% in the past day to reach $4 billion across major exchanges. Such a sharp increase often signals that traders are leveraging positions to capitalize on the rally, but it also raises the risk of sudden sell-offs. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.39, marking a staggering 68% gain over the past month. The token’s performance has been particularly strong in the past week, during which it soared nearly 70%. Year-to-date, XRP has posted an eye-popping 370% increase, significantly outperforming most other major cryptocurrencies. The rally comes on the heels of bullish sentiment sweeping the crypto markets following Donald Trump’s election victory on Nov. 6. While Bitcoin and Solana also posted significant gains, XRP has been a standout performer, driven by a confluence of factors. On Dec. 1, XRP surpassed Solana in market capitalization and has since leapfrogged Tether, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency by total value. Its market cap now sits behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum. The token’s outsized performance has been attributed to a variety of catalysts, including Ripple Labs’ strategic partnerships, new product rollouts, and growing speculation about an XRP-focused exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). Several developments have bolstered investor confidence in XRP: Ripple’s Key PartnershipsRipple Labs has secured a series of high-profile partnerships aimed at expanding the use of XRP for cross-border payments. These collaborations have strengthened the token’s utility and reinforced its value proposition. XRP ETF SpeculationOn Nov. 1, 2024, asset manager 21Shares filed for an XRP ETF, fueling expectations that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve the application. Optimism has also grown amid reports of likely leadership changes at the SEC in January 2025, which could usher in a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. Rumors of Elon Musk’s InvolvementUnverified reports suggesting that Elon Musk may invest heavily in XRP and Ripple have further amplified market excitement. While these rumors remain speculative, they have contributed to the token’s bullish momentum. Analysts Urge Caution Despite the euphoria, analysts like Maarten are urging caution, emphasizing the risks associated with a leverage-driven rally. Historical patterns suggest that rapid increases in open interest often lead to abrupt market corrections. The last time XRP experienced a similar spike, the price saw a sharp 17% decline shortly afterward. Traders are advised to monitor market conditions closely and manage their risk exposure. The combination of leverage, speculative activity, and heightened volatility could lead to significant price swings in the short term. With XRP’s price hitting new multi-year highs, its market performance will remain under close scrutiny. Key developments to watch include the SEC’s decision on XRP ETF applications, the validity of rumors surrounding Musk’s involvement, and Ripple Labs’ continued efforts to expand the token’s adoption. The crypto community is divided between those celebrating XRP’s resurgence and those wary of the risks posed by leverage and speculation. As the narrative unfolds, XRP’s trajectory could set the tone for broader market dynamics heading into 2025. Ripple CTO David Schwartz Condemns Operation Chokepoint 2.0, Citing Threats to Civil Liberties In a related development, Ripple’s Chief Technical Officer, David Schwartz, has joined the growing chorus of tech leaders denouncing Operation Chokepoint 2.0—a purported government initiative targeting the crypto industry through debanking. Schwartz criticized the operation for undermining the rule of law and threatening fundamental civil liberties, while urging regulators to adopt transparent and lawful processes. In a recent statement, Schwartz accused the government of being ”addicted to indirect regulation,” using debanking as a tool to suppress industries without following due legal processes. He identified four critical ways in which debanking undermines civil liberties: Evasion of Surveillance and SanctionsSchwartz argued that debanked entities often resort to switching service providers or taking their funds underground. This not only limits governmental oversight but also reduces the effectiveness of sanctions enforcement. Violation of Due ProcessBy pressuring financial institutions to cut ties with certain businesses, the government circumvents the judicial process, effectively punishing entities without formally charging them with a crime. Infringement on Free SpeechSchwartz linked debanking to restrictions on freedom of speech, noting that financial exclusion can stifle dissenting voices and disfavored industries. Encroachment on Privacy RightsThe CTO criticized the practice for enabling what he described as unlawful search and seizure, with banks being pressured to act as extensions of regulatory agencies. “Our government has become addicted to indirect regulation precisely because of these evils,” Schwartz stated. “It is cheaper and easier to pressure someone else to punish me than to charge me with a crime and give me due process.” He implored regulators to abandon covert tactics in favor of lawful and transparent mechanisms, adding, “It is easier to pressure banks to cut off disfavored businesses than to make that business illegal.” The Fallout from Operation Chokepoint 2.0 The crypto industry has faced significant challenges under what many executives describe as a coordinated effort to choke off financial access. Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, claimed that more than 30 tech firms have been victims of the operation. Other prominent voices have shared similar experiences: Sam Kazemian (Frax Finance)The founder alleged that JPMorgan Chase debanked him in December 2022, reflecting a broader pattern of financial institutions severing ties with crypto firms. Brian Armstrong (Coinbase)Coinbase’s co-founder and CEO has formally requested records related to Operation Chokepoint 2.0 under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and is compiling evidence of what he describes as systemic debanking. Nic Carter (Castle Island Ventures)In September 2024, Carter accused the Biden administration of deliberately orchestrating the collapse of Silvergate Bank—a pivotal institution for the crypto sector. “I believe Silvergate could have survived its drawdown — and was on a path to do so,” Carter said. Schwartz’s remarks come amid growing scrutiny of government actions targeting the crypto sector. Industry stakeholders have expressed hope that the incoming Trump administration, set to take office in 2025, will reverse what many perceive as regulatory hostility. Optimism centers on the possibility of fostering a more balanced regulatory environment that encourages innovation while addressing legitimate concerns about financial stability and compliance. Industry insiders believe such a shift could restore confidence in the United States as a hub for blockchain and cryptocurrency development. While Operation Chokepoint 2.0 has caused significant disruption, the crypto industry remains resilient. Ripple’s David Schwartz and other industry leaders continue to advocate for fair and transparent regulations, underscoring the need to protect civil liberties while fostering technological progress. The debate over crypto regulation reflects broader tensions between innovation and oversight, with the outcome likely to shape the future of the digital economy.",NEGATIVE,XRP,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6328/xrp-rally-faces-volatility-risks-as-analysts-warn-of-leverage-impact,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

A close above the $0.4720 resistance might send the price toward the $0.4880 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5000 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.5200. Downside Correction In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.4500 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.4400 level. The next major support is near the $0.430 level and the trend line. The main support sits at $0.4150. If there is a downside break below the $0.4150 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.4000 level or even $0.3800 in the near term.

37118689,https://crypto.news/?p=14315309,1733114624,XRP flipped USDT and Solana after price surged by 27%,"XRP, a cryptocurrency launched by Ripple Labs Inc, has grown significantly in the past 7 days. These surges have brought the market cap to the third biggest after Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to CoinMarketCap data on Nov. 02, XRP price has surged 27.72% from $1.8 to $2.3 at the time of writing. The price even meteorically increases by 365% from $0.51 in the past month, making them the top gainers along with Peanut (PNUT), Stellar (XLM), and Hedera (HBAR). The price movement also made XRP’s market capitalization as the third largest in the world after surging 26% to $136 billion, surpassing Tether ( USDT ) and Solana ( SOL ) with $134 billion and $108 billion, respectively. 1 Day XRP price chart, September 08 – December 02, 2024 | Source: crypto.news The tokens were also actively traded for about $26.41 billion, or an increase of 75% in a day. Earlier last week, XRP had already flipped Binance’s BNB after they reached $97 billion in market cap, while BNB was still on their $95 billion. Ripple’s business expansion and market optimism pushed the price movement and headed to the all-time high record of $3.8 that was reached 7 years ago.

37118646,https://nulltx.com/?p=135049,1733114533,Crypto Growth Secrets: 5 Coins for High Returns in 2024,"The crypto market is buzzing with action as we move into 2024. Bitcoin’s price keeps flirting with new highs, Ethereum’s updates promise to reshape decentralised finance, and rising stars like Qubetics ($TICS) are turning heads with their unique offerings and explosive growth potential. While volatility is the name of the game, it’s also what makes crypto such an exciting space for high-return investments. Among the standout players, Qubetics is making waves for all the right reasons. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics isn’t just another cryptocurrency—it’s solving problems that other blockchains have struggled to address. With applications like decentralised VPNs and a record-breaking presale, $TICS is a name that keeps popping up in discussions about the best cryptos to invest in 2024. Let’s break down what makes these five coins top contenders for your portfolio this year. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Qubetics has set out to unify the blockchain universe, and it’s doing so with game-changing features. One of its standout applications is its decentralised VPN, a privacy-focused tool that not only secures internet connections but also incentivises users by rewarding them with $TICS tokens for sharing unused bandwidth. It’s a win-win for businesses and individuals alike. Picture this: a small business running sensitive transactions across various locations. With Qubetics’ dVPN, data breaches have become a thing of the past. Or imagine an avid gamer who wants a lag-free experience while ensuring their data isn’t being sold to third parties. Qubetics offers a seamless solution, proving its real-world value. The numbers don’t lie. Qubetics’ presale is currently in its 10th stage, with over 251 million tokens sold to more than 5,300 holders, raising $3.9 million. At $0.025 per token, analysts predict mind-blowing returns, with $TICS potentially hitting $15 post-mainnet launch. A $1,000 investment today buys 40,000 tokens. By the presale’s end at $0.25, that’s $10,000. If the price reaches $15, it skyrockets to $600,000. Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics isn’t just about profits; it’s about solving real-world problems while creating opportunities for unprecedented growth. 2. Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin remains the gold standard in crypto. As the first and most recognised cryptocurrency, Bitcoin’s dominance is unmatched. But as much as it’s hailed as “digital gold,” its use cases are limited by slow transaction speeds and high fees. Despite this, Bitcoin’s value proposition as a store of value continues to attract institutional investors. Recently, Bitcoin has been making headlines as its price stabilises above $37,000. Analysts predict that a bull market could push BTC back to its previous highs of $60,000 or even beyond. For investors looking for stability in an otherwise volatile market, Bitcoin remains a solid pick. Think about it: a $1,000 investment in Bitcoin at its current price secures about 0.027 BTC. If Bitcoin reaches $60,000, that investment becomes $1,620. Not bad for a low-risk addition to your portfolio, though it pales in comparison to the ROI potential of newer players like Qubetics. Why did this coin make it to this list? Bitcoin’s reliability and market dominance make it a cornerstone for any diversified crypto portfolio. 3. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s an entire ecosystem powering decentralised finance (DeFi), NFTs, and smart contracts. With its recent shift to a proof-of-stake model, Ethereum is also becoming more energy-efficient, addressing one of its biggest criticisms. Ethereum’s latest upgrade, known as the “Shanghai update,” is expected to enhance scalability and lower transaction costs. These improvements are crucial for DeFi platforms and dApps, which rely on Ethereum’s infrastructure. Imagine a startup building a lending platform that connects borrowers and lenders without banks. Ethereum makes it possible. Currently priced around $1,800, Ethereum is projected to reach $3,000 by the end of 2024. A $1,000 investment today buys about 0.55 ETH. If the price hits $3,000, that investment grows to $1,650. While it’s not as flashy as Qubetics’ projections, Ethereum’s proven track record makes it a safe bet. Why did this coin make it to this list? Ethereum’s dominance in DeFi and its role as the backbone of blockchain innovation make it indispensable. 4. Solana (SOL): Solana has earned a reputation as one of the fastest blockchains in the world, with transaction speeds clocking in at 65,000 transactions per second. It’s a developer’s dream, enabling the creation of dApps and DeFi platforms without the bottlenecks seen on Ethereum. Recent developments include Solana’s growing NFT ecosystem and its focus on gaming applications. For example, imagine a gaming platform where players can trade in-game assets instantly and with minimal fees. Solana’s speed and low costs make this a reality. SOL is currently priced around $35, with analysts predicting it could hit $80 in 2024. A $1,000 investment secures about 28.57 SOL. If the price reaches $80, that investment grows to $2,286. It’s not the explosive growth of Qubetics, but Solana’s focus on speed and scalability ensures it remains a top contender. Why did this coin make it to this list? Solana’s unmatched speed and low costs make it a go-to for developers and investors alike. 5. Cardano (ADA) Cardano takes a methodical approach to blockchain development, using peer-reviewed research to inform its upgrades. Its Hydra scaling solution promises to make Cardano one of the most scalable platforms, capable of handling microtransactions and enterprise-level applications. For instance, imagine a global non-profit using Cardano to distribute aid transparently and efficiently. Its scalability and focus on sustainability make it a compelling choice for real-world applications. Currently priced at $0.26, ADA is projected to reach $0.50 in 2024. A $1,000 investment buys about 3,846 ADA tokens. If the price doubles to $0.50, that investment becomes $1,923. While the returns aren’t as eye-popping as those of Qubetics, Cardano’s long-term vision and steady growth make it a strong candidate. Why did this coin make it to this list? Cardano’s focus on sustainability and real-world applications ensures its relevance in an evolving market. Conclusion: Choosing the Best Cryptos to Invest When it comes to the best cryptos to invest in 2024, each coin on this list brings something unique to the table. Bitcoin offers stability, Ethereum powers innovation, Solana delivers speed, and Cardano provides a sustainable vision. But Qubetics stands out for its ability to solve real-world problems while offering explosive ROI potential. With its presale nearing a price hike, now’s the perfect time to secure $TICS tokens and position yourself for incredible returns. Don’t miss out—the future of crypto is here, and it’s called Qubetics.

37125930,https://cryptonews.com/?p=314898,1733112384,XRP Surges Past USDT to Become Third Largest Crypto by Market Cap,"Ripple’s XRP jumped 30% on Monday and surpassed USDT in market cap, becoming the third-largest cryptocurrency. The surge extended a multiweek rally fueled by recent catalysts. The token last traded at around $2.46, up 77% in a week and over 375% in a month. Its market cap hit $137.4b, overtaking USDT’s $134.3b. XRP’s value surged after it surpassed Solana in market cap over the weekend. Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, suggested that long-term holders could view this as a favorable moment to sell and secure profits. “There is much more risk for new short and long-term buyers,” he added. Ripple Eyes NYDFS Approval for RLUSD Stablecoin, Targets Dec. 4 Launch Analysts link the token’s recent strength to news that the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) may soon approve Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. According to Fox Business , insiders suggest NYDFS could greenlight RLUSD , with Ripple targeting a Dec. 4 launch. JUST IN: XRP now the 3rd largest cryptocurrency by market cap after flipping Tether pic.twitter.com/lxGoECqa24 — CoinGecko (@coingecko) December 2, 2024 This approval would let Ripple enter New York’s strict digital finance market, boosting its standing in the stablecoin ecosystem. RLUSD would position Ripple to compete directly with major stablecoins like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. Ripple plans to integrate RLUSD into its RippleNet payment platform to speed up and lower the cost of cross-border payments. The stablecoin is set to act as a liquidity bridge in Ripple’s network, complementing XRP, which has faced regulatory hurdles in the US. XRP ETF Hopes Rise as Issuers Await Regulatory Green Light in the US XRP’s price momentum began in early November after Republican wins in the US elections boosted confidence in US-linked cryptocurrencies like Ripple Labs’ XRP. Additionally, investors anticipate an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US, fueled by hopes for a more lenient regulatory environment. No XRP ETF has launched yet in the US, but potential issuers are preparing for favorable regulatory developments. Approval could mark a significant step in making XRP accessible through traditional investment channels. Another factor in XRP’s surge is SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s recent announcement that he will resign in January . His departure might impact Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC over allegations of selling unregistered securities. The SEC sued Ripple Labs in Dec. 2020, accusing the company of selling XRP without registering it as a security. This lawsuit severely impacted XRP’s market position and value, leading to delistings on many exchanges and a sharp drop in price.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE.

It can be a tough choice with so many options out there. But if you’re keeping an eye on the right projects, some are starting to shine brighter than the rest. Solana and Fantom are two of the heavyweights that have been causing waves in the blockchain world. Solana’s blazing-fast transaction speeds and low costs make it a go-to for developers, while Fantom is becoming the favourite for DeFi enthusiasts with its lightning-fast and scalable platform. Both projects continue to grow and bring exciting new features to the space, proving why they’re often listed among the best crypto to invest in right now. However, there’s a new player in town that’s starting to make a serious splash—Qubetics. With its innovative Decentralised VPN (dVPN), Qubetics is carving out its own niche in the crypto world. Plus, with Qubetics currently in its presale phase, analysts predict a significant price surge to $10 to $15 after its mainnet launch. For anyone looking to get ahead of the curve, Qubetics could just be one of the best crypto to invest in right now. Solana: Speed and Efficiency for the Future When you’re talking about the best crypto to invest in, Solana is a name that you can’t ignore. Known for its incredibly fast transaction speeds, Solana has gained a strong following in the crypto community. This high-performance blockchain has been able to scale without compromising on decentralisation or security, which makes it stand out among its peers. Solana’s proof-of-history (PoH) consensus mechanism allows transactions to be processed at lightning speed, making it one of the most efficient platforms available. What’s exciting about Solana is its rapidly expanding ecosystem. From DeFi platforms to NFTs, the network is seeing more and more developers flocking to it due to its low transaction costs and high throughput. Solana’s growing popularity and adoption continue to drive its price upward, which makes it a solid choice if you’re looking for the best crypto to invest in today. And with the network’s constant development, Solana is set to remain a key player in the crypto space for the foreseeable future. Fantom: Fast, Scalable, and Ready for DeFi Fantom is another rising star in the world of crypto. If you’re looking for the best crypto to invest in for the long term, Fantom should definitely be on your radar. This blockchain platform offers quick, secure transactions, thanks to its unique consensus mechanism, Lachesis. Fantom’s low transaction fees and high throughput make it perfect for building decentralised finance (DeFi) applications. And as the DeFi space continues to grow, Fantom is positioning itself as a go-to platform for developers. What sets Fantom apart is its ability to interoperate with other blockchains, especially Ethereum. This means developers can use Fantom to build dApps that are easily integrated with other networks, making it more versatile than many other blockchain platforms. Fantom’s fast-growing ecosystem and focus on decentralisation make it a great contender for the best crypto to invest in right now, and its performance over the last year shows just how much potential it holds for the future. Qubetics: The Future of Decentralised VPN and Security Qubetics is focusing on an area that’s quickly becoming a hot topic—privacy and security. With its Decentralised VPN (dVPN), Qubetics is offering a solution to one of the biggest issues on the internet today: data security. Traditional VPNs come with their own set of problems, from data storage risks to reliance on centralised service providers. Qubetics aims to solve these issues by offering a fully decentralised alternative that puts users back in control of their data. What makes Qubetics particularly appealing is that it’s not just a privacy-focused project, it’s also a tech powerhouse. With the launch of the QubeQode IDE, Qubetics is creating an ecosystem where developers can build and deploy decentralised applications (dApps) in a secure, private, and efficient manner. This will drive more innovation within the decentralised space, bringing more use cases for Qubetics’ token. Analysts predict that the price of Qubetics could surge to $10-$15 after the mainnet launch, making it one of the best crypto to invest in today if you’re looking to get in on the ground floor of a truly disruptive project. With its presale already raising millions and attracting thousands of investors, Qubetics is showing all the signs of a major player in the crypto world. The project’s commitment to security, privacy, and decentralisation is resonating with users and investors alike, and with more features like the QubeQode IDE in the pipeline, it’s only a matter of time before Qubetics becomes a household name in the blockchain space. Conclusion While Solana and Fantom continue to impress with their speed, scalability, and growing ecosystems, Qubetics brings a fresh approach by focusing on privacy and decentralisation. The project’s dVPN offering is filling a much-needed gap in the market, while its upcoming mainnet launch has analysts predicting significant price growth. If you’re looking for the best crypto to invest in today , Qubetics could be the project that not only keeps you ahead of the curve but also delivers substantial returns in the future. With its presale generating excitement and a clear roadmap ahead, Qubetics is definitely worth keeping an eye on. So, if you’re ready to get in early on a project that’s set to revolutionise the world of decentralised internet security, Qubetics might just be the best crypto to invest in right now. Don’t miss out on this exciting opportunity—join the presale and get ready for the future of blockchain technology!

The large-cap altcoin surged over 25 percent in the last 24 hours to trade about $2.4 on Monday, December 2, during the early Asian session. The utility-based altcoin, with a market cap of about $140 billion and a fully diluted valuation of over $240 billion, registered a 45 percent surge in daily average traded volume to about $23 billion at the time of this report. Why Is XRP Going Up As Coinpedia previously noted, XRP price has significantly benefited from the election of pro-crypto leaders in the United States, led by President-elect Donald Trump. The long-standing legal hurdles emanating from the US SEC charges are likely to be dropped once a new SEC chair is confirmed early next year. The notable rise of XRP in the past 24 hours is partly attributed to the heavy liquidation of short traders. According to data from Coinglass, XRP’s leveraged market-led in liquidations during the past 24 hours of more than $50 million, with over $36 million involving short traders. Consequently, the odds of a short squeeze have significantly increased the ongoing XRP’s bullish outlook. 500,000,000 #XRP (945,196,977 USD) unlocked from escrow at unknown wallet https://t.co/BiPf94ED2q — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 1, 2024 In the last 24 hours, on-chain data shows a heightened activity of whale traders, led by Ripple.

Russian Central Bank: P2P Trading Crackdown The Central Bank made its claims in its latest financial stability review. The review focuses on economic results for the second and third quarters of FY2024. The Russian Central Bank Governor and long-standing crypto-skeptic Elvira Nabiullina. (Source: Russian Central Bank/YouTube/Screenshot) The bank claimed that it has been working on joint efforts with the nation’s commercial banks this year. Together, the regulator and the banks say they have blocked scores of transactions linked to P2P trading platforms. Russia’s crypto exchange market remains completely unregulated. Although Moscow has introduced several crypto-specific laws in the second half of 2024, none have tackled exchange-related issues. The exchange market is also highly fragmented. It is also rife with shadowy players and firms that say they can use crypto to transfer cash across borders. As such, the P2P market has ballooned in size. In June 2023, a cybersecurity platform claimed Russian traders could access some “$296 million” worth of trades per day .

And the bank said that most Russians use “anonymous crypto exchanges and P2P exchange platforms” as their “main channels” for buying crypto. Despite its claims, however, the bank also conceded that the “volume of cryptoasset flows attributable to Russian investors” actually increased on FY2023 figures by around 18%. The regulator conceded that Russians transacted some $44.8 billion worth of crypto in the same time period. And it said that the volume of web traffic from Russian IP addresses on global crypto platform sites “increased by 56.5%, to 166.9 million visits.” Russian visitors now account for 7.5% of all visitors to major global crypto exchange platforms, a rise of 1.3% since it last released figures.

It added that Russian traders expect a long-term pattern of “continued growth in cryptocurrency prices.” They foresee an easing of crypto and monetary policy in the United States and the “excitement around memecoins ” as a contributing factor. And the bank added that much chat app-lined software was now using crypto to distribute rewards to their users.

37115009,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620844,1733107007,Experts Predict This Low-Cost Crypto Could Revolutionize Blockchain Innovation,"In a market dominated by high-profile tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum, a new low-cost crypto is capturing the attention of analysts and blockchain enthusiasts alike. Lightchain AI , priced at just $0.07 during its presale, is emerging as a transformative force in blockchain innovation. With its unique integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and cutting-edge decentralized technology, experts believe Lightchain AI could redefine how industries leverage blockchain. Why Lightchain AI Is a Game-Changer Lightchain AI is not just another cryptocurrency—it’s a platform designed to solve real-world challenges while pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology. Its revolutionary features, including Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) , set it apart from traditional blockchains. Key Innovations That Stand Out: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Lightchain AI’s consensus mechanism rewards nodes for performing AI computations, such as machine learning and data analysis, making it eco-friendly and utility-driven. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): AIVM enables the seamless execution of AI tasks directly on the blockchain, offering industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics an advanced, decentralized solution. Scalability Without Compromise: With advanced sharding and Layer 2 integrations, Lightchain AI ensures that its network remains scalable and efficient, even as adoption grows. Meme Coin Pump Pad: In a move that merges serious technology with market energy, Lightchain AI is developing a meme coin pump pad , blending speculative trading excitement with cutting-edge blockchain capabilities. Experts Weigh In Blockchain analysts and AI specialists agree that Lightchain AI represents the next evolution of decentralized technology. By addressing the limitations of traditional blockchains, such as scalability and energy consumption, it opens the door to widespread adoption across industries. “Lightchain AI combines the best of blockchain and AI, making it a future-proof investment for tech and crypto enthusiasts alike.” Why Lightchain AI Could Revolutionize Blockchain Massive Market Opportunity: The global AI market is expected to surpass $1.59 trillion by 2030 , and Lightchain AI is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this growth by offering decentralized solutions for AI integration. Real-World Applications: Industries are already exploring Lightchain AI’s capabilities for fraud detection, predictive analytics, and automated decision-making, highlighting its potential for widespread use. Early-Stage Investment Potential: Lightchain AI’s presale gives investors a chance to secure tokens at an incredibly low price before its technology gains mainstream adoption. Comparing Lightchain AI to Established Blockchains While platforms like Ethereum and Solana have achieved significant milestones, they lack the native AI integration that makes Lightchain AI a standout. Ethereum’s gas fees and scalability challenges, along with Solana’s occasional network outages, highlight the need for a more advanced solution—one that Lightchain AI delivers. What Makes Lightchain AI the Low-Cost Crypto to Watch Priced at just $0.07 during its presale, Lightchain AI provides an opportunity for investors to get in early on a project that could revolutionize blockchain innovation. Its ability to handle both AI and traditional blockchain workloads gives it a versatility that few platforms can match. How to Join the Lightchain AI Revolution For investors seeking a high-potential, low-cost entry into the next wave of blockchain innovation, Lightchain AI offers an unparalleled opportunity. With its innovative technology and early-stage pricing, it’s no surprise that experts predict it could revolutionize the industry.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS.

These digital assets have garnered attention for different reasons, from Dogecoin’s meme-driven popularity to XRP’s robust utility in cross-border transactions and PropiChain’s innovative approach to real estate investment. As investors seek the next big opportunity, the question arises: Which of these altcoins will soon create the most millionaires? Dogecoin Price Surge: Excitement or Overhype? The Dogecoin price is again making waves in the crypto world, surging to a live price of $0.3933 with an impressive 24-hour trading volume of $11.45 billion. This momentum, fueled by a remarkable 169.64% increase in the last 30 days, has cemented DOGE’s position as the #7 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently valued at $57.77 billion. While the Dogecoin price rise is undeniably captivating, its foundation remains tied to external factors like the influence of Elon Musk’s tweets. This dependency makes DOGE a volatile investment. Without robust utility or innovation underpinning its growth, Dogecoin price faces challenges in maintaining its long-term appeal for serious investors. Legal Optimism Fuels a Record-Breaking XRP Price Rally The XRP price has surged an astonishing 218.68% since November 5, marking a remarkable rebound from its early November price of $0.51343. Currently trading at $1.67, XRP price is just 14% shy of its 2021 peak, with analysts setting their sights on a bold target of $4.20. This rally is underpinned by bullish technical indicators, particularly a golden cross, a rare alignment of the 50-day and 200-day SMAs on weekly charts. Historically, such signals have preceded the XRP price all-time highs, intensifying excitement among investors. Regulatory optimism and institutional adoption drive the XRP price growth, with trading volume at $8.4 billion. As Ripple’s SEC battle nears resolution, XRP price is poised to lead the crypto market and potentially achieve record-breaking performance. PCHAIN Beats Dogecoin Price and XRP Price PropiChain (PCHAIN) is poised to outperform the Dogecoin price and XRP price by revolutionizing the $300 trillion real estate market through blockchain and AI integration. Unlike Dogecoin’s meme-driven value and XRP’s regulatory challenges, PropiChain offers tangible utility by tokenizing real estate assets, enabling fractional ownership, and automating transactions via smart contracts. This approach democratizes property investment, providing stability and substantial growth potential. Analysts project that PropiChain could deliver returns up to 12,204%, surpassing the speculative gains of Dogecoin price and XRP price. PropiChain (PCHAIN): Revolutionizing Real Estate with Blockchain, AI, and NFTs PropiChain is reshaping the real estate space by combining blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and NFTs to address the inefficiencies of traditional property management. Built on a decentralized platform, PropiChain transforms real estate investment, ownership, and management into a simplified, secure, and globally accessible space. At its core, PropiChain leverages NFT tokenization to convert physical properties into digital assets. These NFTs represent ownership stakes, enabling fractional ownership where users can buy, sell, or trade portions of high-value properties. This democratization of real estate makes it accessible to a broader audience, eliminating barriers like exorbitant capital requirements and opaque pricing models. By tokenizing real estate, PropiChain brings liquidity to one of the most illiquid asset classes, allowing investors to diversify portfolios and easily trade their stakes. PropiChain’s integration of AI takes real estate management to new heights. The platform delivers real-time insights into property values, market trends, and investment opportunities through automated valuation models and predictive market analytics. Users can automate transactions based on specific conditions, optimizing strategies and minimizing risks. For instance, AI-powered tools can execute property purchases or sales automatically when predefined market criteria are met, ensuring efficiency and accuracy. PropiChain introduces the Propiverse, a metaverse-enabled feature that revolutionizes how investors explore and evaluate properties. Through immersive 3D virtual tours, users can interact with properties as if they were physically present. This eliminates geographical barriers and broadens investment opportunities. The PropiChain platform employs blockchain-based smart contracts to automate lease agreements, rental payments, and renewals. These contracts are tamper-proof and self-executing, ensuring transparency, reducing administrative burdens, and eliminating the need for intermediaries. Why Now Is the Best Time to Invest in PropiChain PropiChain’s presale offers a compelling opportunity for early investors, with the token currently priced at just $0.004. This low entry point is set to rise to $0.011 in stage two and climb even higher in later stages, rewarding those who act quickly with significant cost advantages. Early adopters benefit from discounted pricing and first-mover advantages, bolstered by PropiChain’s listing on CoinMarketCap and BlockAudit -certified security measures, which underscore its credibility. PropiChain outshines the Dogecoin price and XRP price by offering real-world utility and unmatched growth potential, making it the top choice for investors seeking high ROI and transformative opportunities. With the growing presale investments, now is the perfect time to seize this groundbreaking investment.

Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, presented Bitcoin strategic reserve for Microsoft (MSFT) boards on Dec. 01 as he promised earlier . He highlighted that Bitcoin is a transformation of digital capital, and they need to adopt Bitcoin as part of their balance sheet in the next few years. Bitcoin is projected to be one of the biggest assets in the world and account for $280 trillion of global wealth, which exceeds gold and art by the next 20 years with $45 trillion and $110 trillion, respectively. Saylor also noted that Microsoft clearly needed to be powered by digital capital as the price movement of Bitcoin outperformed Microsoft shares by 12 times annually. MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares also jumped to 3,045% after acquiring Bitcoin in the past few years, while MSFT only performed 103%. “Bitcoin is the best asset that you can own. The number’s speaks for themselves. It is make alot more sense to buy Bitcoin than buy your own stock back, or to hold Bitcoin rather than holding bonds. If you wanted to outperform you gotta need Bitcoin,” Saylor mention on his presentation posted on YouTube. Political and market support, which is represented by Trump’s administration and Bitcoin ETF’s products in the stock market, will also make Bitcoin massively adopted in the next few years, so Microsoft has, too.

Now, you might be wondering, “What makes a non-custodial wallet so important?” Well, for starters, it gives users full control over their funds. No longer do you need to worry about relying on a third-party service to store your crypto. In a world where security risks are higher than ever, Qubetics offers a solution that puts privacy and control back into the hands of the users. The Qubetics wallet stands out because it’s designed to be user-friendly, even for those new to the crypto world. Unlike traditional wallets that can be complicated and require technical expertise, Qubetics offers an intuitive experience that allows anyone — from beginners to experts — to manage their digital assets securely. Whether you’re storing tokens, interacting with smart contracts, or participating in DeFi applications, the wallet makes it easy to do it all with a few clicks. This simple but powerful tool is likely to be a game-changer in how we approach blockchain and digital finance. But that’s just the beginning for Qubetics. The project is currently in its presale phase, raising an impressive $3.9 million and selling over 251 million tokens. Priced at just $0.025 per token during presale, analysts predict that the value of $TICS could soar to anywhere between $10 and $15 after its mainnet launch. That means if you get in now, you could be looking at incredible ROI once Qubetics hits the mainstream. With its innovative wallet and upcoming developments, Qubetics is poised for explosive growth, and now could be the perfect time to add this gem to your portfolio. Cronos: A Bridge Between Traditional Finance and DeFi Next up, let’s talk about Cronos, a blockchain that’s been making serious strides in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Cronos is a smart contract platform that focuses on creating an ecosystem that connects traditional finance with blockchain technology. What makes Cronos stand out is its unique positioning within the crypto space: it’s part of the Crypto.com family, which provides it with an established user base and access to millions of users worldwide. With its focus on scalability, interoperability, and security, Cronos is fast becoming a top choice for developers looking to build decentralized applications (dApps). One of Cronos’ most attractive features is its ability to offer fast transactions and low fees. In a space where transaction speed and costs can make or break a project, Cronos delivers on both fronts. This makes it an appealing choice for anyone looking to build on Ethereum but without the high gas fees that often come with it. Plus, Cronos is focused on bridging different blockchain ecosystems, making it easier for developers and users alike to move assets across different networks. If you’re someone looking for a project that’s scalable and has a strong community, Cronos might just be your ticket. Despite its promising tech and growing adoption, Cronos faces stiff competition in the DeFi space from giants like Ethereum and Solana. However, its close ties with Crypto.com give it a unique advantage, especially in terms of mainstream adoption and user accessibility. If you’re looking for a project that is building a powerful infrastructure for the future of decentralized finance, Cronos is certainly one to keep an eye on. Conclusion: The Future of Crypto Is Bright — Get In Now As we’ve seen, Qubetics, Cronos, and Hedera are three projects that have all the right ingredients to succeed in the evolving world of blockchain technology. Whether you’re drawn to Qubetics’ non-custodial wallet, Cronos’ DeFi ecosystem, or Hedera’s enterprise-ready scalability, these cryptos are positioning themselves for long-term growth. But if you’re looking for a project with explosive potential, Qubetics is the one to watch. With its presale raising millions and a future price prediction of $10-$15 per $TICS token after the mainnet launch, it’s clear that Qubetics is poised to be a major player in the crypto space. Add this to your portfolio now, and you could be looking at some seriously impressive returns in the near future. So, what are you waiting for? The best cryptos to invest in now are right in front of you. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to be part of the future of digital finance with Qubetics, Cronos, and Hedera.

Most likely, it’s Ethereum. It’s the leader in smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), and it’s constantly pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the blockchain space. But that’s not all. VeChain, a blockchain project focused on supply chain management, is quickly growing in prominence, solving real-world problems and building trust with enterprises globally. Both Ethereum and VeChain have made huge strides in the crypto world and continue to be some of the best crypto to invest in due to their established use cases and long-term potential. But wait—what if we told you that Qubetics is emerging as a major player, too? With its unique approach to blockchain technology, Qubetics is catching the eyes of investors. The project has just raised $3.9 million in its presale, and with over 5300 holders, it’s gaining serious momentum. Analysts are predicting that Qubetics could hit a price range of $10-15 after the mainnet launch, making it one of the best crypto to invest in for the future. Its QubeQode IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is set to revolutionize how developers interact with blockchain, giving them a platform to build and deploy decentralized applications seamlessly. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Blockchain with QubeQode IDE Qubetics isn’t your typical crypto project. While many focus solely on tokenomics or decentralized finance (DeFi), Qubetics is tackling the developer experience head-on. Its QubeQode IDE is a game-changer for the crypto world. Developers will have access to an all-in-one environment to build, test, and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) without the usual complexity. This makes it easier for both new and experienced developers to jump into the blockchain ecosystem. With Qubetics providing an intuitive platform, blockchain development becomes less intimidating, enabling more innovation in the space. What’s even more exciting? Qubetics’ presale numbers are through the roof. They’ve raised $3.9 million so far, with over 5300 holders and 251 million tokens sold in Phase 10. And at just $0.025 per token, there’s still an opportunity to get in early before Qubetics hits the big time. Analysts are predicting that once the mainnet launches, the price could soar to anywhere between $10-15 per token. With such a promising future and a unique offering in QubeQode, Qubetics is definitely one of the best crypto to invest in today. Ethereum: Still Leading the Charge When it comes to smart contracts, Ethereum is still the king. Its massive network and developer base make it the go-to platform for decentralized applications (dApps). The Ethereum ecosystem is vast and includes everything from DeFi to NFTs. And with the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, Ethereum is transitioning to a more sustainable proof-of-stake model, which only increases its long-term viability. The network’s dominance in the blockchain space makes it one of the best crypto to invest in today, and it’s not showing signs of slowing down anytime soon. Ethereum’s strong presence in the DeFi space, its network of decentralized applications, and its partnerships with major companies all contribute to its continued success. If you’re looking for a safe bet in the world of crypto, Ethereum should definitely be on your radar. While there are other blockchains trying to compete, Ethereum’s ecosystem is tough to beat. For those seeking solid growth, Ethereum remains a leader in the market. VeChain: Supply Chain Management on Blockchain VeChain’s focus is on improving supply chain management through blockchain technology. By providing solutions for tracking products and ensuring transparency, VeChain is helping companies improve efficiency and reduce fraud. With a strong real-world use case, VeChain has partnered with major companies and governments worldwide to improve the traceability of goods and services. This makes VeChain a standout project in the blockchain space and one of the best crypto to invest in if you’re looking for something with tangible use in the supply chain sector. VeChain’s business model is based on providing blockchain solutions to industries, particularly in the supply chain. The network offers a platform for secure data sharing and tracking, which enhances transparency and reduces errors in the supply chain. As more industries look for ways to streamline their operations and reduce fraud, VeChain’s technology could become even more essential. For investors who are interested in a blockchain project with practical applications, VeChain is certainly worth considering. Conclusion While Ethereum and VeChain continue to make strides in their respective spaces, Qubetics offers something different—and perhaps even more exciting for future growth. The combination of a presale that’s already raised $3.5 million, a rapidly growing community, and analysts predicting a price surge to $10-15 after the mainnet launch, makes Qubetics one of the best crypto to invest in for 2024 and beyond. Its QubeQode IDE and tokenized marketplace are set to make a real impact on the blockchain world, attracting developers and businesses alike. With a promising future and innovative solutions for blockchain development, Qubetics is not just another project—it’s a movement. If you’re looking to diversify your crypto portfolio, Qubetics could be the perfect addition. With its impressive presale success and unique approach, it might just be the best crypto to invest in right now. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to get in early!

From explosive presale performances to quirky tokens making headlines, meme coins are proving to be a gateway for crypto enthusiasts looking for quick wins. If you’re scouting for the best new meme coins to buy and hold for short-term gains, you’ve hit the jackpot. Today, we’ll be diving into three rising stars in the meme coin universe: BTFD Coin, Notcoin, and Snek. First up, let’s talk about BTFD Coin , the current darling of the crypto community. This coin has been making waves with its presale performance, crossing impressive milestones at lightning speed. With over $400,000 raised and 10 billion coins sold so far, BTFD Coin has captured the hearts (and wallets) of investors globally. But hold on—Notcoin and Snek are no slouches either. Both of these tokens bring unique vibes to the table, offering exciting opportunities for those seeking fast returns. So, grab your popcorn and let’s break down why these three coins are the best new meme coins to buy and hold for short-term gains.

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHEMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/sheikh-musk-shemusk-solana-memecoin-to-surge-16000-before-exchange-listing-while-shib-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The Altcoin Season Index has reached 74/100, signaling a robust shift into alt dominance, while the Fear & Greed Index sits at an “Extreme Greed” level of 81—caution is advised, but the excitement is palpable. Source: coinmarketcap.com This week, we conclude our three-part series on the AI crypto sector. After exploring Fetch.ai ($FET ) and Render Network ($RNDR )—two giants with established reputations—it’s time to shed light on a true underdog: Opulous ($OPUL ). Ranked 824th with a market cap of just under $55M, OPUL is a fraction of FET ($4.7B) and RNDR ($4.69B), making it a potential dark horse in the AI coin race. Small in size but mighty in potential, OPUL represents a rare high-risk, high-reward play. Let’s dissect its fundamentals and technicals to see why it could outpace its larger peers. Opulous: Fundamentals at a Glance At its core, Opulous is revolutionizing music financing and rights management with blockchain technology. By tokenizing music royalties, the platform allows artists and fans to interact in an entirely new way. Its standout features include: Market Cap: $55M, ranked 824th. A minuscule valuation compared to Render’s $4.69B, highlighting the upside potential. Circulating Supply: Fully diluted at 500M tokens (no inflation risk; all tokens are already in circulation). CEX Listing Potential: Currently trading on niche platforms like MEXC and Gate.io. A listing on larger exchanges like Binance or Coinbase could transform its supply-demand dynamics, especially since liquidity is relatively scarce. In essence, Opulous combines blockchain utility with a niche, high-growth industry (music royalties). This unique narrative makes it stand out, especially as AI and decentralization converge across sectors. Technical Analysis: Resistance, Breakouts, and the Bigger Picture 1W Chart: The Battle at 12 Cents Price action this week underscores the importance of the $0.12 level—a confluence of horizontal resistance (where previous rallies have failed) and dynamic resistance (the 50-week and 100-week SMAs). A breakout above this zone would signal a major trend shift, but until then, caution is warranted. Let’s break this down:​ Dynamic Resistance: The 50-week SMA (simple moving average) curves upward just below $0.12. Think of it as a long-term moving trendline that acts as a ceiling until broken. (In simple terms: the 50 SMA tracks average prices over 50 weeks, smoothing out short-term noise.) Horizontal Resistance: Historical price action shows that $0.12 aligns with multiple rejection zones, making it a psychological and technical barrier. Why It Matters: Breaking above this confluence could lead to a rapid climb to $0.17 (next resistance) and beyond, as historical supply zones diminish. 1D Chart: Preparing for Lift-Off On the daily chart, OPUL has reclaimed the 200-day SMA ($0.09) for the first time in over a year—a textbook bullish signal. Volume, while still subdued, shows signs of rising, and the chart suggests a potential Golden Cross (when the 50D SMA crosses above the 200D SMA—a classic bullish formation). Key observations: Rejection Zone at $0.39: This level, the upper border of a 2.5-year accumulation range, rejected March’s rally, marking it as a critical take-profit target for long-term bulls. Golden Cross Alert: Expected in December if momentum holds. Strategies: Entering the Dark Horse Breakout Above $0.12 Why: A confirmed daily or weekly close above $0.12 validates the bullish trend, opening the door to $0.17 and beyond. Stop Loss: $0.11 (tight for breakout traders). Take Profit: $0.17 (initial resistance), $0.39 (long-term resistance). $0.09-$0.07 Accumulation Zone Why: Confluence of dynamic support (200 SMA on daily) and historical horizontal support. Stop Loss: $0.065 (below the 2.5-year accumulation range). Take Profit: $0.12-$0.17. Absolute Bottoms: $0.05 Zone Why: Final support level based on multiple retests during the bear market. Ideal for stink orders. Stop Loss: below $0.04. Take Profit: $0.09, $0.17, $0.39. Long-Term Targets: Moonshots and Reality Realistic Goals (2024): $0.17 (early 2023 resistance). $0.39 (March’s rejection zone). $1.00-$1.25 (historical key levels). Ultra-Optimistic Goals (2025): $3.50 (5x market cap). $7.67 (ATH from 2021 bull run). Risk vs. Reward: A breakout above $0.12 significantly reduces downside risk, but the low liquidity and small market cap could amplify volatility. Stick to a strategy and avoid emotional decisions. Summary: A Hidden Gem with Tremendous Potential Opulous represents the kind of opportunity that comes along rarely: a niche project with strong fundamentals, undervalued in market cap, and ripe for a breakout. However, patience is key. The $0.12 resistance zone remains a pivotal battleground, and a breakout will likely define the next leg of its journey. For now, keep an eye on volume, monitor the charts, and always respect stop-loss levels. As the final installment of our AI trilogy, Opulous stands out not just as a coin but as a story waiting to unfold. Small in size, colossal in potential—this dark horse could lead the race if the market aligns. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Market Strategist Says WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Go From $0.017 To $11 First,"Speculations about the Dogecoin price in the crypto market are heating up, and recent forecasts from market strategists are suggesting that the Dogecoin price might reach the $5 mark. However, the attention of most investors is not on the Dogecoin price but on WallitIQ (WLTQ), as the same market strategist predicts that the newcomer, WLTQ, will rise from $0.017 to $11 before the Dogecoin price gets to $5.

Following the market strategist’s predictions of WallitIQ (WLTQ) to rise from its current presale price of $0.017 to $11, most investors are in doubt that the Dogecoin price will get to $5 in the near future. As a result, many of these investors are rapidly buying the WallitIQ native token, WLTQ in order to position themselves for massive future gains.

There are also incentives such as a 180% annual percentage yield (APY) when holders stake their tokens.

The WallitIQ wallet provides top features such as a Scan and Pay QR functionality that eliminates errors and saves time during transactions and DeFi payments. WallitIQ (WLTQ) also combines advanced encryption standard (AES) and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to guarantee the investors’ private keys and transactions are protected from fraudulent interceptions, making WallitIQ (WLTQ) a highly secure yet user-friendly decentralized wallet.

Will Dogecoin Price Hit $5? The recent surge in the Dogecoin price has stirred a new debate among market strategists and investors on whether the Dogecoin will hit the $5 mark. Based on new Bitcoin ATHs and political developments, Dogecoin price volatility continues to maintain its relevance in the crypto market. Following Donald Trump’s victory in the just concluded U.S. presidential elections and his appointment of Elon Musk to head the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the interest in the Dogecoin price has increased among crypto enthusiasts. In the past, the Tesla CEO’s tweets have often influenced the Dogecoin price. The announcement of Musk’s involvement in this crypto-supportive government has further heightened investor interest in the meme coin. According to data from CoinGecko, Dogecoin’s market cap is at $56.7 billion with a daily trading volume of $12.4 billion. As of the time of this writing, the Dogecoin price is at $0.3861.

37092990,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656214,1733097611,"Shiba Inu Burns Spike 7,418% In 1 Week – Can SHIB Price Continue Pushing To New Highs?","Shiba Inu, the popular meme coin, has witnessed an extraordinary surge in its burn rate, with a staggering 7,418% increase and over 2 billion SHIB tokens burned over the past week. This significant reduction in circulating supply has ignited optimism among investors, especially with the Shiba Inu price currently trading at yearly highs. Shiba Inu Weekly Burn Reaches New Highs Shibburn, the official platform tracking SHIB token burns, revealed on social media platform X a 7,418% spike in SHIB’s weekly burn rate during the week leading up to November 30 . This sharp rise resulted in the removal of approximately 1.937 billion SHIB tokens from circulation, a significant milestone in the ongoing effort to reduce the token’s massive supply. Following this X post by Shibburn, the momentum of SHIB burns has only increased alongside the Shiba Inu price. At the time of writing, the total number of SHIB tokens burned over the past seven days has exceeded 2 billion, reaching an impressive 2.15 billion SHIB tokens. From this, 386.5 million of these tokens were burned within the last 24 hours alone. How Burn Mechanics Impact SHIB Price Token burns are a mechanism by which cryptocurrency supply is deliberately reduced, aiming to increase scarcity and, in turn, create upward pressure on the asset’s price. For Shiba Inu, which started with an enormous circulating supply, consistent and sizable burns are critical to its long-term valuation prospects. Shiba Inu was created with a total supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, but SHIB burn endeavors have reduced the circulation by almost half. The latest Shiba Inu burn figures underscore the community’s dedication to this strategy, with over 2 billion tokens removed from circulation within a single week. At the time of writing, the total circulating supply of the meme coin is 589.26 trillion SHIB tokens. The aim has always been to burn a majority of the SHIB tokens created. According to Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama, this ambitious goal can be achieved . However, he did note that burning 99% of the total SHIB tokes created is also hard for a few reasons . Furthermore, he noted that burns are not the only way SHIB wins. There is the need to give the memecoin utility and ensure it gets to a point through viral distribution that people don’t want to burn the token anymore. At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at $0.00003059, having increased by about 13% in the past 24 hours. Notably, the Shiba Inu reached an intraday high of $0.00003146, bringing it very close to setting a new price high in 2024.

Ethereum (ETH) is aiming for $5,800 after breaking out of a head and shoulders pattern.

Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s price is attempting to climb above the $0.5 mark. CoinMarketCap data reveals it has gains of 10.5% and 139.0% on the biweekly and monthly levels.

This audit helps to build trust in the platform and gives traders confidence in the fairness of their transactions. Ethereum breaks out of H&S pattern Trader Tardigrade told his followers in a recent tweet that Ethereum has broken out of an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern.

With this breakout in place, the altcoin price is likely to explode to a new all-time high. Trader Tardigrade forecasts a target of $5,800 for the altcoin in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, the sentiment around the Ethereum ETFs has improved. Over $200 million has flown into the ETF in the past week. Also, the VWMA (10) and Hull Moving Average (9) are flashing buy signals that support an uptrend. At the moment, the Ethereum price is trading above the $3,500 mark.
