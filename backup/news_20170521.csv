42399867,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz1l5,1495407682,Enterprise Ethereum Alliance Adds 86 Members to Blockchain Consortium,"The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance has more than tripled in size, with the group announcing 86 new members today drawn from a wide range of industries.  Among the new members are South Korean telecom Samsung, pharmaceuticals giant Merck, automaker Toyota, investor communications platform Broadridge, financial markets firm DTCC, and the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, which oversees licensed businesses in the state.  The EEA was officially launched in late February, aimed at developing enterprise-focused solutions with the open-source ethereum as a basis but that are, in some cases, more privacy-oriented. Conversely, the idea is to create a kind of positive feedback loop that leads to improvements of the public blockchain protocol as well.  And the diversity of the new members, according to Andrew Keyes, head of global business development for EEA founding member ConsenSys, is evidence that the initiative is positioned to disrupt many more industries beyond the finance world.  Keys predicted that the collaborative effort could lead to some unexpected partnerships among the financials, tech giants and nascent startups all working on EEA projects.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Not only can these industries work and learn from each other, you're going to start seeing multi-sided, or n-sided marketplaces where it's not just the banks operating with each other, it's actually the banks turning into software companies and getting close and more seamless with their clients.""  Some of the major firms that joined today echoed that sentiment in statements.  ""We look forward to active collaboration with the members of the alliance,"" said Kwang Woo Song, vice president of Samsung's Distributed Ledger Technology Business Group. ""And believe that there will be significant synergy opportunity to drive the adoption of blockchain in the enterprise space.""  A number of startups focused on the blockchain space are joining the EEA's ranks as well, including AlphPoint, BigchainDB, BlockCypher, Datarella, DigixGlobal, Gem, Hashed Health, Hijro, Libra, Melonport, the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance, and the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company.  Consortia evolution  2017 has been a year of major change for the world's blockchain consortia, and today's announcement signals that these collaborative efforts are likely to evolve further as the year continues.  Early this year, a shake-up at banking consortia R3 saw founding members JPMorgan and Santander align themselves more closely with EEA, even as R3 itself expanded its focus to include a number of regulators among its ranks. Meanwhile blockchain consortium Hyperledger continues to grow its own member base, as well as the number of projects that are developing under its umbrella.  As for the EEA, representatives say that its growth phase is far from over.  After the group announced its initial batch of 30 members two months ago, it took another month to recruit today's batch, according to Keys, whose employer, ConsenSys, is widely credited with helping organize the consortium.  Now that the members are public, he says it's only a matter of weeks before the next class is debuted.  Keys explained:  ""We've got a similar volume of companies that are still going through onboarding right now, and we'll be having that announcement next month.""

42399871,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz1p1,1495401083,Deloitte Exec Departs to Launch Tokenized Blockchain Research Lab,"Back when Iliana Oris Valiente first started pitching her colleagues at Deloitte on the possible benefits of bitcoin, she was cautioned by a senior level executive that she might be doing damage to her reputation.  Now, one of the co-founders of Deloitte's influential Rubix blockchain initiative is well-known for helping push the professional services firm to the forefront of distributed ledger consulting and development. That is, until last Friday, when she completed her final day at the firm.  Revealed today exclusively to CoinDesk, Valiente is now launching two startups in the research and development space.  The first, is a an open-source, crowdfunded, crowdsourced applied research and development hub. The second is an educational enterprise designed to shorten the learning curve for recent computer science grads seeking to make meaningful contributions to the blockchain industry.  The co-founder of Rubix by Deloitte, and former strategy and execution lead, told CoinDesk she views her new customers as the very same people who will help her pull off the endeavor: open-source researchers, startup employees and corporate executives.  Valiente said:  ""This has value to all those groups of stakeholders, whether you're talking about the research and development hub or the educational initiative, and I want to continue playing that role as a translator and a liaison between these various communities.""  First revealed today as part of her trip to CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference, the research and development hub called ColliderX takes its name from the CERN particle collider in Switzerland, which leverages researchers, scientists and academics to make technological discoveries.  Born from Valiente's own personal experience encountering research questions, the newly launched Toronto non-profit organization gathers difficult-to-answer questions from around the industry and then lets contributors, backers, and a scientific selection committee prioritize the order they are addressed.  Crypto-tokens minted through an unspecified platform will then be used to rank the research questions in the order they will be answered based on the resources available, though she was careful to point out she doesn’t think the ""governance tokens"" as she called them will accrue value ""as soon as it hits an exchange"".  A new business model  Initially, Valiente will encourage participants to select topics based on their status as foundational to the ability to answer other questions, and on them having a ""smallish"" scope that could lead to publishable results by a team of two researchers in a matter of months.  Currently, she has collected 25 topics provided by industry developers, including the potential role that artificial intelligence could play in helping to figure out upper and lower bounds for smart contracts performance, leading to what she termed the creation of ""crowd-trained smart contracts"" that self-improve.  Among the list of researchers who have already submitted topics are Mir Adnan Ali of CG Blockchain who wants to explore how the augmented reality space can be tied into blockchain and Steve Mann, an early innovator in wearable augmented reality devices and a visiting professor at Stanford.  ColliderX now counts among its partners the Association for Computing Machinery, which administers the Turing prize, representatives from the University of Waterloo, the University of Toronto, York University and MIT, with advisory work contributed by MME, the law firm that helped incorporate the Ethereum Foundation.  ACM chair of the Practitioners Board Conference Committee, Toufi Saliba, explained why his group joined the project:  ""We feel their intersection of effort with our initiative of colliding AI experts with blockchain experts is quiet fascinating. We couldn't wish for a better timing in running this and we will be looking forward to working closely.""  Blockchain learning curve  While the first half of Valiente's post-Deloitte career is aimed at answering questions the professionals have, the second half of her work aims at questions of a different sort.  By the time Valiente left Rubix, she said her team was spending a significant amount of time on-boarding recently graduated new hires who she said had not been adequately prepared for a career in blockchain, something she hopes to change by working closely with schools and universities.  Initially, she said she's starting with a handful of universities at which she has contacts, working with them to built out their curriculum to better prepare graduating students for the blockchain work force.  As jobs in the blockchain space become increasingly in demand, Valiente believes her second project has as much a chance to go global as the research and development itself.  She concluded:  ""Ideally, the fundamentals would be covered in training programs and schools before candidates start full time work. There's plenty of on the job learning that will still need to happen once the theory ends and the practice begins.""

42379504,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX888Mr,1495370453,Consensus Hackathon 2017: Into the Smart City Blockchain 'Rabbit Hole',"""How do I parse this string? I need to get the digital asset ID.""  Alongside excited chatter about how blockchain technology might one day disrupt a range of technology industries, this is the sort of nitty gritty technical discussion that permeated the first day of CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 Building Blocks hackathon. Held over two days this weekend on the 40th floor of 30 Rockefeller Center, the event brought together a global selection of developers, designers and project managers.  While production software usually takes months or years to create, hackathon attendees have a total of about 30 hours to hack a project together, fueled by a dozen or so boxes of Todaro Bros's coffee, bagels and pizza.  The hackathon featured a number of challenges, each sponsored by well-known startups and enterprises, including the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, the Linux-led Hyperledger project, IBM and a half a dozen more. Automotive company Wanxiang wanted to see smart city applications, for instance, while insurance company Swiss Re asked developers to look into agricultural micro-insurance applications.  Although there were a range of challenges for developers to compete in, the hackathon didn't have a strict theme. Rather, hackers have the freedom to build what want.    The result is was what looked like a technology buzzword paradise. Many teams ultimately chose to pair the technology with other industries that are drawing recent attention, such as Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. This meant there was a huge variation in projects. ""They’re going to put rabbits on the blockchain,"" one attendee joked.    Still, a couple of themes stood out. Despite the variety of blockchain choices, most of the projects were being built on ethereum.  Participant Yangbo Du explained that his team is working on a ethereum-based health care records system that could be paired with artificial intelligence to calculate risk. He expects that the blockchain prototype that they build at the hackathon will ultimately make it into his company's product, a ""personal risk advisor"", as he put it.  Autonomous cars on a blockchain  One team, with members largely hailing from Australia, was still in the early stages of planning their ethereum-based project while in conversation with CoinDesk.  They knew that they wanted to create an application that would help with safety in a future filled with autonomous cars, a technology some researchers believe will expand to households rapidly in the near future. But after generating a few ideas, they weren't sure which one to run with.  “We've solved 15 different problems now and we're not sure which one to choose,” participant Tim Bass joked.  In one idea, the team envisioned a future where roads feature a mix of types of cars, say 70% are autonomous, while the rest are still driven by humans. The problem in this scenario is that leaderless cars are typically better, more cautious drivers.  Their proposed solution is to penalize ""bad"" normal cars with ""dickhead"" tokens for driving poorly or taking advantage of the politeness of autonomous cars.  ""If you continue to accrue these tokens, it would affect your driving history and your reputation,"" Bass explained.  To accomplish this, they would gather data directly from the road (in the case of an accident for instance) that the insurance company could then use for the reputation system. Though, it's worth noting that some have questioned whether this type of data collection can be accomplished in a ""trustless"" fashion.  Inevitable smart cities  Another ethereum project, tentatively called Smart City Protocol, could perhaps incorporate the autonomous car project somehow.  Developer Chase Thompson called the project an ""open platform for masterplanning a smart city"" in conversation with CoinDesk. In broad terms, you could think of it as an open-source smart contract for managing various aspects of a smart city, an idea that the team believes has been gaining momentum in the technology world. Developer Vishal Vinayak noted India launched a 20-city smart city program just last year.  Yet, the developers believe that other smart city projects haven't been quite ambitious enough.  ""Basically, smart contracts can handle everything, so we're trying to build one that actually does,"" said developer Morgan Sliman, adding that smart city applications range from energy management to tracking ownership of tokens.  ""There are a lot of rabbit holes we can go down in terms of city management and how blockchains can integrate into that. But from a macro view, it's a great way to keep track of communities and really every aspect of life,"" Thompson added.  Developer Leon Do thinks that this sort of project is inevitable.  When asked whether the team would consider working on the project after the hackathon ends, he told CoinDesk:  ""If it's not us, somebody else will.""  Toward the real-world  With progress beyond the hackathon in mind, each company had a dedicated conference room where representatives gave product tutorials and where attendees could pop in to ask questions. For instance, IBM demoed Hyperledger Composer an open-source API for making blockchain applications faster to develop.  Still, this early in the game, imaginations might be in hyper-active mode and it's impossible to say which blockchain applications will necessarily take off. (This shouldn’t be a surprise for such a new technology. Uncertainty about the future was exactly the case with the early Internet.)  Sponsors emphasized building applications that would be genuinely useful, perhaps especially since some hackathon attendees are only were poking their heads into the space for the first time.  In a presentation describing Deloitte's end-to-end solution for bringing blockchain applications to production, consulting manager Savita Muley emphasized the importance of building applications that genuinely need blockchain technology.  She asked the audience of a couple dozen developers packed into a conference room:  ""Is this really a blockchain solution? Or can you do it with other technologies?""  Deloitte's reward will go to the application with ""highest potential for commercialization."" The company plans to help the winning team bring their project to fruition with a three-hour consulting session in their Blockchain Lab in Wall Street.  Each group will present their prototypes to an audience and a panel of judges on Sunday afternoon.
