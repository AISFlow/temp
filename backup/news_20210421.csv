42386530,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTog7,1619043715,"Maker Price Passes $4K for First Time, as MakerDAO Brings Real Estate to DeFi","MakerDAO made history in 2017 as the first blockchain-based protocol to launch a major automated cryptocurrency-lending platform, helping to initiate a boom in what's known as decentralized finance (DeFi).      Now MakerDAO is paving the way for what might become another source of growth in the now-$60 billion DeFi industry: lending against trillions of dollars of real world assets including residential properties, in competition with banks and other financiers. In this case, ""real world"" refers to collateral other than cryptocurrencies. Even the giant U.S. bank Citigroup is writing about Maker.      Holders of the project's maker (MKR) tokens have been rewarded with a 55% price increase in the past week, the second most among the 46 cryptocurrencies that have a market capitalization of at least $3 billion. The token has gained nearly sixfold this year to a market value of about $4 billion.      The MKR token's price surged above $4,000 on Wednesday for the first time as members of the MakerDAO community – the decentralized organization that governs the project – passed an executive vote to allow an ERC-20 token representing an ownership stake in a pool of real estate assets as collateral.      The proposal, passed April 14 and executed two days later, allows the Tinlake blockchain protocol to serve as a bridge between New Silver, a real estate loan company, and MakerDAO. Two tranches of interest-bearing tokens will be issued under the Ethereum blockchain's ERC-20 token standard – DROP and TIN – against non-fungible tokens (NFTs) based on individual deposits from New Silver.      “This is DeFi taking on traditional finance,” Sébastien Derivaux, a community member of MakerDAO, told CoinDesk in an email. Initially, the project will finance loans to renovate houses in the U.S., he said.      MakerDAO, known for its stablecoin dai, is the biggest DeFi protocol, with $9.5 billion of system collateral, according to the website DeFi Pulse.      MKR, meanwhile, is categorized as a ""governance token"" for MakerDAO, giving holders voting rights to amend the protocol's rules as well as a stake in the project's success.      There's a built-in incentive for the community not to approve loans against the dodgiest collateral.    ""Should the collateral in the system not be enough to cover the amount of DAI in existence, MKR is created and sold onto the open market in order to raise the additional collateral,"" according to a November 2017 article by Gregory DiPrisco, identified on the MakerDAO websitehttps://makerdao.com/en/about/ as head of business development for the Maker Foundation. ""This provides a strong incentive for MKR holders to responsibly regulate the parameters.""    During the “Black Thursday” sell-off in cryptocurrency markets in March 2020, a sharp drop in the price of ether (ETH), the dominant cryptocurrency used as collateral in Maker for collateralizing dai loans, forced the protocol to issue new maker tokens into the market. The dilutive event sent MKR’s price tumbling.      Derivaux says Maker also faced selling pressure last year from the project's early investors, including Polychain, Maker Foundation and Andreessen Horowitz.      Since the dislocation in March, the MakerDAO community has tried to maintain dai’s peg to the U.S. dollar during a highly volatile market. Recent efforts included tinkering with the protocol’s USDC vault and the introduction of peg stability module (PSM).      The latest move to add real-world assets “greatly increases the addressable market for collateralized loans,"" said Jack Purdy, an analyst at the cryptocurrency research firm Messari. Such increases in turn should help to increase the supply of dai, ""preventing the price from consistently exceeding the peg.""      The market capitalization of dai is now over $3 billion, after tripling this year, reflecting exploding demand, according to the cryptocurrency data provider Glassnode.      According to data from The Block, Maker is also the most profitable DeFi protocol by far.      “Many people have dismissed Maker because it moves slow and isn’t the most exciting project,” Ryan Watkins, another analyst at Messari, told CoinDesk. “But it is the most widely integrated protocol in DeFi, produces the most tried-and-trusted decentralized stablecoin and generates the most earnings for token holders in all of DeFi.”      Derivaux said that more “value investors” from traditional finance are now coming to Maker, on the heels of its token burning commitment.      Notably, Citigroup wrote about the report last week, calling referring to MakerDAO as “the decentral bank.” An instant rally ensued in maker's price.      Derivaux wrote this week in a post that MakerDAO could onboard two packages a month of ""real-world"" collateral, starting in May, eventually increasing to about 10% of the protocol's overall assets.      He also dismissed other stablecoin competitors’ criticism of dai’s overcollateralization.      “There was a narrative that dai can't scale because it has to be overcollateralized,” Derivaux said. “Well, we are still overcollateralized, but the collateral space is now multi-trillions.""",POSITIVE,ETH | MKR,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MKR | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/21/maker-price-passes-4k-for-first-time-as-makerdao-brings-real-estate-to-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a6c438d3e99926151660d496cbed21f77eade861-1500x893.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386532,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTohN,1619043563,Binance's Tesla Stock Token May Have Raised Regulatory Red Flags: Report,"Binance’s marketing campaign to citizens in Hong Kong for its security token representing Tesla stock may be a violation of local securities regulations, according to a prominent local news outlet.      Inducing the public to purchase securities is a regulated activity that requires a license from the city’s top financial watchdog the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Gaven Cheong, a partner at law firm Simmons & Simmons, told the South China Morning Post on Wednesday. Binance does not appear to have secured a license to market or trade security tokens in the region, according to the report.      Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges by volume, launched its Binance stock token on April 12. This new service allows its users to buy fractions of companies’ shares with digital tokens. The zero-commission tokens qualifies holders for returns including dividends.      The users can purchase as little as one-hundredth of a regular stock. Such transactions can only be settled by Binance USD (BUSD), a U.S. dollar stablecoin issued by the exchange. The underlying stocks are in the custody of a third-party brokerage company, according to Binance’s website. It is unclear which brokerage firm is the custodian and where it is located.      The posting of announcements that advertise a security token could be seen as an invitation amounting to “dealing” in securities, the report said. The SFC considers security tokens “likely to be securities,” according to its statement regarding security tokens in March 2019.      Binance had not responded to requests for comments by press time.      The first stock token issued by Binance is backed by electric car maker Tesla’s shares. Binance also added tokens representing Coinbase’s $COIN stock after the exchange went public in the U.S. last week.      While banks and trading platforms in Singapore have opened compliant security token trading services due to loosening financial regulations, such tokens are still heavily restricted in many other regions such as mainland China and the U.S.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/21/binances-tesla-stock-token-may-have-raised-regulatory-red-flags-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91f25fb9830f8e27f84eb6b4f4f16f87dbfb9ac0-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386536,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTonf,1619038874,"Q1 2021 Industry Trends: NFTs Rise to Fame, DeFi Consolidates 2020 Gains","After a year of exponential growth and activity, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector is beginning to cool.      In Q1 2021, the dollar value of crypto assets under management by DeFi applications appeared to grow 150%, from roughly $20 billion to $50 billion. However, the majority of this activity reflects the rising dollar value of ETH and other Ethereum-based tokens, not growth in the real number of crypto assets under management.      Adjusting for this “price effect,” by fixing crypto asset prices over a 90-day period, we can see that total value locked (TVL) in DeFi grew 50% over the quarter, with a gradual correction towards the end of March.      Trading volume on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) also saw a similar pattern of steady growth and a slight decline near the end of the first quarter.      The sector that stole DeFi’s thunder is the non-fungible token (NFT) industry, with an over 25x increase in trading volume and valuations over $2 billion for certain marketplaces.      NFT marketplaces like NBA TopShot are fast approaching the same levels of user activity as the top DeFi apps. However, it remains to be seen how much of the NFT sector’s initial burst of activity will carry through into the rest of the year.      NFTs are unique and indivisible crypto assets that can represent a variety of goods such as art, video, music, real estate, news stories and even tweets. The ownership of NFTs are verifiable through a public blockchain like Ethereum, which makes them difficult to forge but easy to authenticate.      Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?      Over the past three months, financial and mainstream media has been transfixed by the novelty of NFTs and their adoption by deep-pocketed investors. Renowned British auction house Christie’s sold an NFT artwork by the artist Mike Winkelmann, aka Beeple, for a record-breaking $69 million. Shortly thereafter, Sotheby’s, another reputable auction house, announced on March 16 it would be making plans to host its own NFT art sale.      For all the hype around NFTs this past quarter, value in and user activity for DeFi applications remains stable.      The two most popular decentralized applications (dapps) by number of active accounts across all general purpose blockchains in Q1 2021 are both DEXs. Uniswap, which runs on Ethereum, ended the quarter with an estimated 55,000 active accounts. The runner-up, PancakeSwap, which runs on the Binance Smart Chain, had nearly 50,000.      Read more: Controversial Dapps Test Binance Smart Chain’s Decentralization      Much of the DeFi sector’s value and activity, which accumulated to dizzying heights over 2020, has remained constant into 2021 despite the novelty of its applications being outshone by NFTs in the first quarter.

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $55,502 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 1.9% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $54,565-$57,043 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC close to the 10-hour and 50-hour moving average on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin has changed little over the past 24 hours, despite the asset’s notorious volatility causing the spot market to undulate from $54,565 to $57,043 during the session, a $2,478 swing, according to CoinDesk 20 price data.      Nevertheless, BTC has mostly stayed above $55,000 for almost a month. According to CoinDesk 20 historical data, the last time bitcoin closed below that level was back on March 26.      Since the start of April, bitcoin’s dominance, a measure of the asset against the broader crypto market as calculated by charting firm TradingView, has plummeted. It’s down almost 10% since April 1, and bitcoin is currently at 51% dominance as of press time, roughly half the market. At the beginning of 2021, that figure was over 70%.      “Traders are looking for opportunities elsewhere,” noted David Russell, VP of Market Intelligence at brokerage firm TradeStation Group. ”That’s what seems to be happening now. It’s not bearish but a potential sign of confidence in the space.”      Less bullish bitcoin action after the excitement of Coinbase’s direct listing isn’t a surprise for some, with prices unable to break through all-time high of $64,829.14 reached April 14. “As expected, we saw the April 14 ‘Coinbase top’ we were positioning for that bled into a deleveraging weekend sell-off,” noted quantitative trading firm QCP Capital in an investor note on Wednesday.      A week later, traders are looking at other markets to play in. Volumes on major spot exchanges are much lower than average Wednesday, below $3 billion on the eight major exchanges tracked by the CoinDesk 20.      TradeStation’s Russell told CoinDesk that U.S. dollar inflation will continue to be a key driver for investment into cryptocurrencies, and the case for crypto remains. According to data aggregator Inflation Tool, in the past decade the greenback’s value has decreased in purchasing power,so that it takes $118 in 2021 to pay for something that would have cost $100 in 2011.      “Procter & Gamble is raising prices and the [Federal Reserve] isn’t raising interest rates. Signs of inflation are mounting throughout the economy,” added Russell. ”Inflation and scarcity value could emerge as newer drivers for the crypto space, especially with a Fed meeting next week.”      Read More: During Bitcoin’s Latest Crash, ‘Tether Premium’ Shows Where Money Went    Ether bullish over bitcoin    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Wednesday, trading around $2,425 and climbing 4.2% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      While bitcoin’s price has been mostly stagnant this week, ether is popping. A good measure for comparing the world’s oldest cryptocurrency to ether is by viewing charts on the ETH/BTC pair, available on most major cryptocurrency exchanges.      When the pair on the charts goes bullish, it means traders are selling bitcoin for ether, the case right now.      The ETH/BTC went bullish on Tuesday, with the price now well above the 10-day and 50-day moving averages on the hourly chart; it’s up over 5% so far today on Coinbase.      “It's interesting to note at the current ETH/BTC ratio we are back to levels last seen at the beginning of February,” noted Andrew Tu, and executive at quantitative trading firm Efficient Frontier.      “In February we saw this top out at 0.046 BTC. So this is the level we should be looking at, to see whether it breaks out of that resistance,” Tu added. As of press time, ETH/BTC was trading at 0.043 BTC on Coinbase.      Nick Mancini, research analyst at crypto sentiment analytics firm Trade The Chain, told CoinDesk a breakout in bitcoin's price performance could cause ETH and other crypto markets to see red. “If bitcoin breaks bullish out of the current trend, we will likely see ETH and [altcoins] take a small hit.”      Read More: Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Said to Be in Talks to Buy BitGo    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly higher Wednesday.

It will contribute in 2021, but not necessarily in the second quarter to a great extent.”      Signature says it’s still in the process of doing due diligence on the custodians it wants to use for the bitcoin-backed loans. Silvergate works with Fidelity, Coinbase, Anchorage and Bitstamp for its lending product.    Read more: Fidelity Now Extends Bitcoin-Backed Loans Through Silvergate    ""We also want to have the ability to liquidate quickly, and we won't negotiate on margin or liquidation provisions,” Signature’s DePaolo said.      The bank CEO noted that Signature was open to more cryptocurrencies than just bitcoin as collateral but wouldn’t say what the interest rate yields would be on the loans except that they’d be more “than our traditional CNI"" or cash net income.    Deposit growth    Signature also reported that it raked in $4.4 billion in deposits from crypto customers in Q1 of this year.      Last quarter, the bank said its deposits from crypto customers totaled $10 billion. If that number held steady, then the bank now has $14.4 billion from the digital currency space.      The bank added 110 crypto customers for a total of 740 customers from the industry. This falls well below Silvergate Bank’s 1,104 customers in the space, but Signature’s deposit growth from these customers more than doubled Silvergate’s $1.8 billion growth in crypto customer deposits in Q1.      Deposit growth from digital currency customers at Signature is also driven by the bank’s blockchain-based payments platform Signet, which offers real-time fiat payments for crypto customers 24/7. DePaolo would not break out figures on Signet’s transaction volumes.    Signature’s reach    Signature banks dollar reserves for stablecoin issuers, over-the-counter trading desks, crypto exchanges, blockchain companies and bitcoin miners.    Read more: Signature Bank Added $3.8B in Non-Interest Bearing Deposits in Q1    On the company’s earnings call, DePaolo was pressed on whether or not deposits from these customers would stick around.      “Well, 30% of those deposits are in [demand deposit accounts] because we’re getting the operating accounts,” DePaolo said. “We’ve been asked, ‘What about the big banks? The Chases and the Citis, if they get into digital in a big way?’ Well, we’ve been competing with them for 20 years so we’re not worried about the big players.”      Similar to Silvergate’s Q1 earnings call, DePaolo was also pushed on how the bank was deploying deposits from crypto firms into securities that would offer higher yields.      “We do keep a decent amount of liquidity against these deposits because it’s still early on,” DePaolo said. “Although we have a team that’s been around for eight years in the business, it’s still early on for the crypto world.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/21/signature-bank-goes-head-to-head-with-silvergate-in-bitcoin-backed-lending,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d51026deb13e12ca287da28805f02e98196578d-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386526,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBToZp,1619025818,The Graph Launches Microtransaction System for Blockchain Data Providers,"The Graph has introduced Scalar, a microtransaction system meant to enable new ways for the platform’s node operators and data providers to make money.      The Graph, which describes itself as “the indexing and query layer of the decentralized web,” functions as a link between decentralized applications (dapps) and different blockchains, providing a data querying platform that other blockchains and projects can use for their data requirements. The platform enables participants to package queries into “subgraphs,” custom feeds that provide application programming interface (API) data for use by blockchains and dapps.      The platform supports decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, including Uniswap, Synthetix and Aave, as well as major blockchains Polkadot, Solana, NEAR and CELO. The project also has its own native token, GRT.    Read more: Blockchain Data Indexer ‘The Graph’ to Support Polkadot, Solana, NEAR and Celo    “Using Scalar, node operators have a new way to monetize their infrastructure through query fees paid in GRT, and data providers can be paid directly for making useful data available for apps without paywalls and ads,” The Graph Foundation said in a statement, noting that the volume of transactions on the network created the need for a microtransactions infrastructure beyond existing options.      “The major jump in Web3 use cases” including DeFi and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) “has created unprecedented demand for a truly decentralized and scalable query processing system,” the foundation said.    Scaling transactions with state channels    Scalar was co-developed by The Graph Foundation and software developer Edge & Node with Connext, a peer-to-peer, cross-chain liquidity network specializing in microtransactions. Using state channels, where users can interact directly with one another more efficiently outside of the blockchain, Scalar aggregates and compresses transactions before they are finalized on-chain.      “Within The Graph ecosystem, we started looking at state channels a little over two years ago. And everyone said we were crazy,” Tegan Kline, co-founder and business lead at Edge & Node, told CoinDesk in an interview. “We kind of went against that, and we did a lot of research within the state channels space.”      “This is the first time state channels will be used in broad-scale production,” Kline added. “Scalar is this major new building block for infrastructure in the decentralized applications space. We’ll be using this within The Graph ecosystem to be able to handle the billions of queries that we’ve seen on The Graph’s hosted service, in The Graph’s decentralized network.”      In March, The Graph’s hosted service processed more than 600 million queries a day alone, totaling more than 19 billion queries, according to the platform.      Kline noted that the platform has seen “over 100x growth in the hosted service. In June of last year, we did 1 billion queries, which was a really big milestone.” The March queries figure “speaks to the explosive growth within Ethereum and the other blockchains that are supported on the hosted service,” she said.",POSITIVE,NEAR | GRT,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ZRX | NEAR | GRT,Cameron Hood,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/21/the-graph-launches-microtransaction-system-for-blockchain-data-providers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e028f0bdc04e5788d831de03fbb7ae7b79c748f7-2560x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto is cool, crypto is tres chic.      Recently, Acker, America’s oldest wine store, began accepting several cryptocurrencies as a form of payment.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    “We’ve had numerous requests regarding cryptocurrency over the past few months, which set us in motion,” an external representative for the fine wines retailer and auction house said. While it hasn’t yet made a sale in crypto, it “anticipates doing more and more business in cryptocurrency as time goes on.”      It integrated with BitPay with the understanding that crypto could become an “everyday” payment mechanism and that crypto people have lots of new money.      “It is clear that there has been significant wealth created by cryptocurrency and that there is a new demographic of buyer with significant buying power [who] is here to stay,” the rep said.      See also: Louis Vuitton, Cartier, Prada to Use Bespoke Blockchain to Tackle Counterfeit Goods      It’s following a familiar playbook here. During crypto’s first major hype cycle, a single Lamborghini dealership accepting BTC made headlines. In 2017, a gold retailer, a few politicians, a Swiss university, a budget airline and Microsoft began accepting at least BTC. Others experimented with the crypto obsession du jour, initial coin offerings, too.      The pace accelerated quite a bit this year. Tesla began accepting BTC, as have the National Basketball Association's Dallas Mavericks and Major League Baseball's Oakland Athletics. There’s a boutique hotel in Nashville and two luxury watchmakers, Franck Muller and Hublot, are selling certain timepieces exclusively for BTC. I’ll spare you the rest.      All these businesses are thinking in the fiat mindset, where you simply trade one asset (usually worthless dollars) for another consumable good. But crypto can open up a world of opportunities.      As Vogue Business noted: “Cryptocurrencies can act as social tokens, building community and loyalty.”      These are things that traditional asset classes just cannot provide. Trading crypto for a case of wine could be a decent deal if you time the purchase correctly; wine is a highly appreciable asset, and a case of 2010 Brunellos might outcompete the DOGE you spent on it. But it also may not.      That’s one of the reasons no one apparently jumped at the opportunity to buy a Tesla in BTC – despite the fact that it’s perhaps supplanted lambos as the automotive status symbol for coiners. Acker is betting “crypto investors look to diversify [into] wine.” I think they’re more likely to do it in fiat.      Crypto’s nouveau riche don’t just want conspicuous consumption, they want more crypto. The New York Times and Forbes orchestrated successful non-fungible token (NFT) auctions because it left crypto holders with another volatile asset that follows the same moon logic that made them rich in the first place.      In a recent New York Magazine article, tech critic Scott Galloway predicted luxury brands will develop a “coin strategy,” which would merge the world of crypto and brand ""loyalty.” Companies have long issued points/rewards/tokens, and crypto offers programmability and much greater opportunity for business innovation.      Institutions like Stanford or Chanel could auction social tokens that are provably scarce, confer special privileges and let them be owned outright. Stanford coin would secure your child’s seat at the university, while a $10,000 Hermes coin might buy you a dedicated personal shopper. Perhaps Tiffany would only sell its latest releases to TFNY coin holders, Galloway imagined.      “Crypto is leveraging our instincts around scarcity,” he said. There’s some force deep in the human psyche that values rare things. It’s the driving force behind crypto and luxury goods.      If luxury brands want to stay à la mode, they had better make a move.

42386525,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBToYZ,1619020830,Ampleforth Is Giving Governance Tokens to Every Wallet That Ever Held AMPL,"Rebasing cryptocurrency protocol Ampleforth is launching a governance token that all past and present users of its price-elastic AMPL token are able to claim.      Project leads told CoinDesk any wallet that has ever “touched” AMPL – 75,743 wallets at press time – will be eligible to collect its portion of the new FORTH tokens through the next year. Active participants in the protocol should expect a higher share, they said.      The FORTH airdrop is set to be Ampleforth’s first step in decentralizing the decision-making process that keeps its uncollateralized token, which has a market cap of around $460 million, more or less orbiting $1. Coinbase Pro listed FORTH Wednesday, shortly after the token's reveal.      Ethereum-based Ampleforth bills itself as a building block for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects that want to do business in a stablecoin-esque crypto. Think of a token with the “censorship resistant” attributes of bitcoin (minus the volatility) and the relative stability of a tether (minus the dollar reserve), explained Ampleforth CEO Evan Kuo.      While nowhere near as volatile as bitcoin, AMPL, which has no reserves, is hardly as stable as the U.S. dollar. At press time the coin was trading around $1.50, up from 86 cents at the beginning of April.      The protocol trades price volatility for fluctuations in supply, he said. When the token climbs too high above target the protocol automatically adds units to holders’ wallets. This extra supply helps deflate prices.    Read more: This DeFi-Ready Token Is Teaching Crypto Traders to Cherish Inflation    Ampleforth sets its price target from the buying power of 2019 dollars and adjusts that target by regularly pulling consumer price index data from government-issued sources.      “The introduction of that oracle means we do need a little bit of governance,” Kuo said, explaining the team did not know if its semi-stable model would work prior to Ampleforth’s 2019 launch.      But it has – generally. Apart from a period of crazed volatility during the DeFi summer, AMPL has more or less wobbled between 75 cents and $1.75 for much of the year, according to CoinGecko. Kuo said he and his fellow creators are “just glad that we’ve stabilized” the coin with “parameters that work today.”      “We don't want to be modifying these parameters forever,” he said. “We don't want that responsibility; we need some way of kind of progressively decentralizing the governance of this oracle whitelist.”      Kuo said 67% of FORTH tokens will be distributed to the community through April 21 of next year, with over 80,000 wallets eligible. Unclaimed tokens will be moved to a dapp, he said.      Users who are more deeply invested in AMPL should expect to receive more FORTH than those who have simply held the token at some point. Providing liquidity, holding through negative rebases count toward greater shares, Kuo said.      “We just want this to be distributed as broadly as possible, to those who have a vested interest in the success of the AMPL network,” he said.

42386535,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTol9,1619018694,Bitcoin Transactions Are More Expensive Than Ever,"Bitcoin’s average transaction fees have well surpassed all-time highs as miner outages in China have slowed block production at a time when demand for block space has never been greater.      Per multiple sources, the average fee is roughly $59. In 2017, during the peak of bitcoin’s (BTC) last bull market, average transaction fees just tapped $50.      These high transaction fees coincide with a series of accidents at Chinese coal mines which have taken mining farms in the coal-rich regions of China offline. Bitcoin’s hashrate has fallen some 25% to 125 exahashes a second, according to mining pool-reported data.      “This is a combination of ASIC shortages, huge price increases of BTC outpacing difficulty and the sudden hashrate drop, resulting in slower block times, backlog of transactions and extra fees per block,” Compass Mining Chief Business Officer Thomas Heller told CoinDesk.    Read more: A Guide to Saving on Bitcoin’s High Transaction Fees  The effect of hashrate on Bitcoin transactions    With as much as a quarter or more of bitcoin’s hashrate reduced and Bitcoin’s mining difficulty at an all-time high, blocks are coming in at a slow and scattered pace, with multiple blocks taking an hour or more to be mined. (One block took two hours, an incredibly rare occurrence).      At this rate, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty will probably adjust in the first few days of May. This self-correcting score manages how hard or easy it is for miners to find the next block in Bitcoin’s blockchain, and it typically changes every two weeks (or more accurately, after every 2,016 blocks).    Read more: How Do Bitcoin Transactions Work?    Bitcoin can only adjust its difficulty by 25% each retargeting period, but estimates suggest Bitcoin is due for a 30% adjustment to correct for the drop in hashrate (which would imply more than one downward adjustment ahead, assuming more hashrate doesn’t come online). If the affected miners come online before the next difficulty adjustment, the correction wouldn’t be as severe.      “We are expecting to hear more information in the coming days in regards to the timelines for coming back online. If things progress smoothly then it's possible the machines could be online by the weekend,” Heller said. But “most Xinjiang miners are waiting it out,” he continued, to migrate their machines to Sichuan in anticipation of China’s rainy season.

42434242,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAFbh,1619014212,Consensus 2021: The Ongoing Fight for Privacy,"Privacy is a civil right worth the fight. It’s a right we’re in danger of losing – that we were always in danger of losing – as life continues to move online. Technology, we’ve found, can be a tool for freedom as well as repression, or at least cheaper and more precise forms of mass surveillance.      These are the battle lines the early cypherpunks, the progenitors of cryptocurrencies, drew. Back when crypto referred to cryptography, the art of secreting information, rather than cryptocurrency, these people dreamt up and developed ways to ensure a modicum of online privacy.    Marta Belcher will explore ""What Are You Worth? The Economics of Privacy"" as part of the Explorations track at Consensus by CoinDesk, our virtual experience May 24-27. Register here.    “Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age,” programmer Eric Hughes wrote in the “A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto.” The document was published during the height of the Crypto Wars, a period when the U.S. government attempted to stifle development of commercial encryption.      For most of modern history, encryption was a military technology, a way for states to conceal their secrets during times of war and peace. Computers weakened the governmental monopoly on encryption and made it public. This is how the world got PGP, or pretty good privacy. And, ultimately, Bitcoin.      See also: ‘Economics Will No Longer Be the Handmaiden of Politics’: A History of the Cypherpunks, Feat. Jim Epstein      Today's Crypto Wars have new players on the battlefield: corporate power. The U.S. National Security Agency, FBI and Department of Homeland Security routinely demand “backdoors” into encrypted apps, but private companies made a business out of snooping.      We’re accustomed to speaking about web giants like Facebook and Google breaking consumer trust, but Marta Belcher, a lawyer with Protocol Labs and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, thinks financial surveillance is a bigger issue for the future. Most forms of money exist in private ledgers: credit cards, online payment processors and banks.      Essentially, before crypto, every transaction that was not conducted with cash or barter was at the mercy of private money-transmitting businesses. They have a record of all transactions and the ability to determine who can transact with whom.      “A cashless society is a surveillance society,” Belcher told CoinDesk.      This trend will only accelerate as the online economy grows. Central banks the world over are developing digital currencies that could one day largely replace physical cash. The growth of legacy finance-dependent fintechs and banks shows little sign of slowing.      To some extent, crypto is the only exit. Owned by everyone, cryptocurrencies are the latest frontier in the fight for privacy.      “Cryptocurrency is important for civil liberties precisely because it imports the anonymity of cash into the online world. That is a feature, not a bug,” Belcher said.      CoinDesk spoke with Belcher over email about this ongoing fight. She’s due to speak at Consensus 2021, in May, on the same subject.      What's the issue in privacy today you are most worried about?      Financial surveillance. For some reason, we accept the financial surveillance of the traditional banking system as completely normal. We don’t question the idea that financial institutions turn over data about our transactions to governments by default. And now, governments are increasingly extending the financial surveillance of the traditional banking system to cryptocurrencies. I’m worried about what that means for our civil liberties. My view is that, in the U.S., this financial surveillance is unconstitutional.      What's the biggest mistake or misconception that is made in the debates around online privacy?      The idea that anonymity is bad and that tools that enhance privacy enable crime. Privacy and anonymity are not bad or illegal; they are essential for civil liberties. And this is especially true for financial transactions.      I remember pictures from the Hong Kong protests showing long lines at subway stations as pro-democracy protesters waited to purchase tickets with cash so that their electronic purchases would not place them at the scene of the protest. For me, this underscores that a cashless society is a surveillance society, and shows the importance of anonymous transactions. Cryptocurrency is important for civil liberties precisely because it imports the anonymity of cash into the online world. That is a feature, not a bug.      The refrain that cryptocurrency facilitates crime is wrong. This is exactly the line of reasoning we hear from critics of end-to-end encryption and Tor. But the fact that a technology could be used to violate the law does not mean that there is something wrong with that technology. Notably, criminals have long used cash to commit crimes, but we don’t call for a ban on cash as a result and we don’t blame Ford when one of its cars is used as a getaway vehicle in a bank robbery. That may sound like an outlandish hypothetical, but I’m reminded that in the 1980s studios actually tried to make VCRs illegal because they could be used for copyright infringement, and they almost succeeded.      What do you think about recent crypto regulatory proposals like FinCEN’s crypto reporting requirements, the Department of Justice’s Crypto Enforcement Framework, and FATF’s crypto guidance?      I think these are a disaster for civil liberties. Unfortunately, the U.S. government has been increasingly pushing to extend the financial surveillance of the traditional banking system to cryptocurrency. For example, government agencies have been specifically targeting privacy coins, and have even made up an acronym – “AECs” or “anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies.”      The U.S. Department of Justice wrote in its ""Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework"" in October that use of privacy coins like zcash is “indicative of possible criminal conduct.” The DOJ also said that mixers and tumblers can be criminally liable for money laundering because they are designed to conceal or disguise information about financial transactions.      In addition, FinCEN’s proposal would require certain cryptocurrency businesses to collect information not only about their own customers, but also people whom their customers interact with, and to turn over some of that information to the government by default. And the Financial Action Task Force also has new draft guidance that would greatly expand the number and kind of intermediaries that would be required to collect transaction data for the purposes of turning that data over to the government.      In my view, everyone in the crypto space should be concerned about these proposals and the government expanding the reach of financial surveillance to crypto.      Is centralization a core issue in privacy?      Absolutely. We experience so much of our daily lives through a handful of large corporations. And we have no choice but to trust those companies not to misuse troves of data about us – what we do online, whom we talk to, what we click on and what we say – to trust them to keep that data safe from attackers and to protect our civil liberties when responding to requests from governments. There are all sorts of proposals for addressing these concerns, many of which involve heavy regulation, but my view is that the answer is decentralizing the web.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/21/consensus-2021-the-ongoing-fight-for-privacy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7a0423240d7f6b57e61166c072ccdfd0e2b4c708-2400x1334.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

(WIZP:OTCQB), formerly known as Wize Pharma.    The Chinese bitcoin miner manufacturer said Wednesday it will be shipping and installing the A1246 ASIC AvalonMiners for Mawson Infrastructure throughout 2021, adding an additional 1.05EH to its global mining operations.  Headquartered in Sydney, Mawson has mining operations across the United States and Australia.  Canaan’s latest AvalonMiner model, the A1246, was launched in the third quarter of last year. Canaan said the SHA256 bitcoin mining rig produces a hashrate of 90TH/s with a power efficiency of 38J/TH.  “Backed by our robust supply chain model, we are excited to be partnering with Mawson in their next phase of growth as they ramp up their mining activities,” said Nangeng Zhang, CEO of Canaan.  In March, Canaan reported orders for its cryptocurrency mining machines were rising amid sky-high prices for bitcoin, with increased demand for its equipment from North America and Central Asia since late 2020.  As reported by CoinDesk, bitcoin’s hashrate, which is a way to measure the total power consumption and mining output of the network, has topped new all-time highs as mining firms like Mawson Infrastructure continue to add more hash power.

42434230,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAFBh,1619010485,BitGo Adds $600M in Insurance Capacity to Comfort Big-Time Bitcoin Holders,"BitGo has placed over $700 million in insurance coverage for large amounts of cryptocurrency held at arm’s length from the rough winds of the internet.      The Palo Alto, Calif.-based custodian, which is said to be in acquisition talks with Galaxy Digital, has $100 million in cover for all customers using its platform. BitGo also offers clients the ability to top up their insurance by purchasing their own dedicated limits, and in this capacity the custodian’s insurance program has expanded by a further $600 million, the company said Wednesday.      “We’ve been able to offer to our clients the ability to purchase bespoke insurance directly from a group of insurers that sit on top of our insurance at very favorable rates,” said Peter Najarian, BitGo’s chief revenue officer. “I would imagine our in-force coverage of over $600 million is certainly the largest in the marketplace today.”      BitGo’s crypto insurance is sourced from the Lloyd’s of London market.      In terms of comparable policies and programs, Crypto.com was probably the past record holder with about $360 million (which includes some cover from BitGo). Coinbase has $320 million in cover, according to public documents. However, that was bolstered by an additional $500 million in opt-in cover, according to a source with knowledge, bringing Coinbase’s total offering to $820 million. Another source, however, told CoinDesk the whole, $500 million premium has not been paid by Coinbase, only a partial deposit, potentially making BitGo's $700 million the industry's largest in-force insurance program. (Coinbase declined to comment.)      It’s not easy to get insurance cover for crypto assets, and to attain capacity in the hundreds of millions of dollars usually requires the crypto assets to be held in cold storage at a distinct remove from the internet.      Typically, this sort of risk is covered by a “specie” policy, used to insure fine art or bullion held in bank-grade vaults. One side effect of keeping things in deep cold storage is that it takes time to get to them, and service-level agreements (SLAs) for getting assets trade-ready stipulate anything from one hour to 24.      Some critics point out that such an arrangement is less than optimal for trading crypto assets, but BitGo CEO Mike Belshe has called this a feature, not a bug.      Institutional clients with hundreds of millions of dollars held in crypto find it reassuring that these assets can’t be instantly moved online by some automated process, Belshe has said previously.    Read more: The $1 Trillion Wallet: BitGo’s Big Plan to Secure the Biggest Bitcoin Fortunes    BitGo did not share data about the number of customers who have taken advantage of the top-up cover, or the average amount purchased.

42434246,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAFjh,1619004600,"Valid Points: The Reality of ‘Rayonism,’ a New Plan to Merge Ethereum and Eth 2.0","This week, we do a deep dive into the intricacies of one single Ethereum 2.0 metric: total value staked (TVS). There’s a lot of nuance to this metric, but once you do the legwork a little knowledge can really pay off in terms of insight into the protocol and a better understanding of how to interpret what seems at first like major discrepancies in the data across providers and sources.      Then, in true nerd fashion, we delve into an ongoing hackathon that, even if you’re not particularly keen on joining, you’re still going to want to know about. Why? Because the future of Ethereum 2.0 depends on it.    Pulse check: Interpreting the metrics of TVS  Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Explained in 4 Easy Metrics    There are a number of different ways users and data providers interpret the metric total value staked (TVS) on Ethereum 2.0. Depending on that interpretation, the calculations for this metric and the resulting figures will differ, sometimes by thousands of ETH.      Whenever reading figures for TVS on Eth 2.0, it’s important to consider how the metric is being interpreted in order to understand and make sense of the discrepancies found in its value in different sources.      Most users and data sources will calculate TVS by how much ETH has been sent to the Eth 2.0 deposit contract.      As background, the deposit contract is an Ethereum-based smart contract used by the Eth 2.0 blockchain to verify which users are eligible to become active validators and earn rewards on Ethereum’s parallel proof-of-stake (PoS) network. A one-time deposit of 32 ETH must be sent to the deposit contract before a user can become an Eth 2.0 validator.      Summing up the initial deposits of prospective Eth 2.0 validators is how sites such as Etherscan, Dune Analytics, CryptoQuant and Glassnode calculate value accruing on Ethereum’s PoS network. Between these sites, the total amount of ETH sent to the deposit contract may differ by one or two validator deposits, depending on when a particular site last queried the Ethereum blockchain and updated their webpages with the latest on-chain data.      Other data providers query the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain directly and calculate total ETH staked by summing the balances of validators who are online and eligible to earn rewards on that network.      Not all deposits of 32 ETH on Ethereum are immediately activated on Eth 2.0. At times there is a pending queue where validators must wait for a period before their stake is eligible to earn rewards. In other cases, a validator is offline or disconnected from the internet; therefore, that stake would not be used toward finalizing blocks or transactions. Validators can also be forcefully removed from the network for malicious behavior and, again, in this case their 32 ETH deposit would not be eligible for fulfilling validator responsibilities.      The total balance of all online and active participants on Eth 2.0, including validator rewards, is the second way in which the metric reflecting total ETH staked can be interpreted. Both beaconcha.in and BeaconScan use this figure for their chart and data analysis. Because it does not count the initial ETH deposit of all validators in existence but selectively chooses the stake of eligible validators, the resulting total is usually less than what is tracked by the first method.      The third way in which TVS can be calculated is by summing the deposits of all validators and their reward balance irrespective of their status or eligibility.      So long as transfers of ETH to Ethereum 2.0 remain a one-way deposit and any rewards accrued on Eth 2.0 stay on Eth 2.0, this interpretation of TVS reflects a cumulative total of all the wealth that has been sent to Ethereum’s PoS blockchain since its launch, as well as how much new wealth has been issued in the form of interest on validator balances.      It usually results in the highest estimate for TVS. Compared to the amount of ETH in the Eth 2.0 deposit contract, which is 3,891,586 ETH, and the amount of eligible stake on Eth 2.0, which is 3,876,812 ETH, the total value accumulated on Eth 2.0 stands at 3,978,285 ETH, all at time of writing.      Since launching the CoinDesk Data Dashboard, I’ve been using this last interpretation to calculate TVS on Eth 2.0. It is the widest definition for this metric, and one that I think captures how much is riding on the protocol overall.      Each of these interpretations, however, is set to evolve and become less interchangeable as a way of measuring value growing on Eth 2.0 once the network initiates its merge with Ethereum.    New frontiers: Transitioning to Ethereum 2.0 With ‘Rayonism’    Let’s talk about Rayonism, the hackathon project for Ethereum’s forthcoming transition to PoS.      As background, Ethereum developers launched a parallel PoS blockchain dubbed “Ethereum 2.0” back in December 2020. It operates separately from the existing Ethereum blockchain and was originally going to be the network onto which users and decentralized applications (dapps) are eventually transferred.      With Rayonism, the thinking has changed.      Instead of deprecating Ethereum’s proof-of-work (PoW) network through a multi-phased upgrade, developers are looking to rewire the protocol so that consensus – that is, the way blocks and transaction history get finalized in a decentralized protocol – happens on Ethereum 2.0.      The “consensus layer” of Ethereum would essentially get swapped out from PoW mining to Eth 2.0 staking. The execution of user transactions and dapps would continue as normal on Ethereum and be maintained by the same software clients many of us know and love like Geth, OpenEthereum and Hyperledger Besu.      The software clients maintaining Eth 2.0 (such as Prysm, Lighthouse and Teku) would also continue to have their role in maintaining and supporting Ethereum’s PoS consensus layer. Merging these two parallel systems, as opposed to transitioning from one into another, does introduce complications.      This means consensus and execution are not done on one single piece of client software, as most Ethereum users and dapp developers are used to doing today. After “the Great Merge,” Ethereum’s software will have a composite design consisting of two parts: a consensus node and an execution node.    What does Rayonism look like in practice?    Well, no one is really quite sure. To find out, Ethereum developers have kicked off a month-long hackathon for designing a test network (testnet) that has all the features of Rayonism implemented, plus functionality for sharding. (If you don’t know what sharding is, I recommend reading this article,but, in short, it's a way to greatly scale Ethereum’s transaction capacity and keep fees low on the network over the long term.)      Over the next four weeks, hackathon participants will be heads down building and iterating upon a list of shared ideas and to-do’s for making Ethereum’s Great Merge a reality. On May 14, all projects will be presented and judged in the hopes that abstract plans for PoS activation on Ethereum are made more concrete and brought forward in the network’s development timeline.      As always, the goals are ambitious with Ethereum developers and the Ethereum 2.0 project. Will Rayonism succeed? As always, I look forward to seeing it try.

The purpose of the group is to ""ensure collaboration between regulators and the private sector"" in order to foster innovation, according to the release. Under the terms of the bill, Congress is to create the working group within a 90-day period from the date of the bill's passing.      The overarching goal of the legislation seeks to clarify when the SEC has jurisdiction over digital assets, in the case of when they are deemed securities, and when the CFTC has a final say, in the case of when digital assets are classified as commodities.      Representatives outside the government are also to be involved and are to come from a financial technology company, a financial services institution and small businesses using financial technology. Investor protection groups, organizations that support investments in underserved businesses and at least one academic researcher will also be included, as CoinDesk previously reported.      ""This is the first step in opening up the dialogue between our regulators and market participants and move to needed clarity,” said McHenry.
