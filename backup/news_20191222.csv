42431332,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1jbh,1577026800,Regulatory Issues Need More Clarity in 2020,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world.Donna Redel is founder of Strategic 50, a consultancy dedicated women in business, and board member of New York Angels, an independent consortium of over 100 individual accredited angel investors.      Having a big idea is great, but pushing forward and implementing it requires sustained attention to detail. Many of us see nearly limitless possibilities for cryptocurrencies and other blockchain applications, but that future will not come to pass if stakeholders do not continue to pay close attention to the developing global legal and regulatory frameworks. In 2019 there was some progress on this front for U.S. blockchain companies – among other things, the SEC finally issued its framework for token issuers – but the year did not bring as much clarity as many hoped. Just ask cryptocurrency companies who are still trying to figure out what William Hinman, the Director of the SEC’s Division of Corporate Finance, meant when he said, in April 2018, that some tokens were “sufficiently decentralized” as to no longer be considered securities. In fact, the big picture only grew more complicated as the Treasury Department, the G-7, and even President Trump entered more prominently.      To help address that uncertainty, I organized the inaugural Fordham Law Blockchain Regulatory Symposium in partnership with another Fordham Law alum Joyce Lai, an attorney at ConsenSys. The event took place in November but we conceived it back in April when we had both wondered why New York City did not have a dedicated academic blockchain regulatory event. There were certainly enough gray areas and complex issues to devote a full day to the current legal landscape and how it might be reimagined – because if we want the industry to move forward responsibly and quickly, we need to create opportunities for constructive dialogue between the private and public sectors.      So we proposed to Fordham Law School that it sponsor a daylong symposium on key industry and legal issues, with discussion and debate among a diverse array of participants, including partners from law firms, general counsels, academics, judges, regulators, investors and entrepreneurs. We felt it was important to hold the symposium under the law school’s auspices because that would ensure a level of intellectual rigor; as well, there was a significant educational opportunity for the school itself. As a law student, whether you end up at a big or boutique firm or working in government or clerking for a judge, you are going to be confronted by these issues because blockchain regulation touches on so many different areas of the law: i.e. property, contracts, securities, intellectual property, antitrust.      As we put together a roster of speakers, it was a bit of a surprise to discover how many major law firms, on both the securities and fintech sides, are already deeply engaged in blockchain issues. People are always asking when blockchain will become more institutionalized but much work is being done behind the scenes to pave the way for transitions on both the legal and regulatory fronts. In one sense, then, the Fordham Law symposium was a vehicle to share and expand on conversations that have already been taking place between the private and public sectors.      The two keynote speeches were by Linda A. Lacewell, superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, and Caitlin Long, who leads the Wyoming Blockchain Task Force – each representing states with very different approaches to cryptocurrency-blockchain regulation. Superintendent Lacewell, only recently confirmed, has indicated her office will aim to strike a balance between protecting consumers, on the one hand, and encouraging innovation on the other.      Caitlin and Wyoming, meanwhile, are aggressively challenging New York’s supremacy in financial custodianship with a new and comprehensive legal framework they hope will spur creativity in the field. This state-by-state approach was in full view during 2019, and at the Symposium, where we also heard about Delaware’s blockchain law that will allow companies registered there to allow securities to be on a blockchain once federal regulations permit that. Rhode Island and New Jersey are also moving forward to encourage blockchain startup companies. But New York remains the nation’s financial center and I expect 2020 will be a great year for blockchain-fintech startups in the state.      A series of panel discussions brought together federal regulators, lawyers, and academics, yielding insights into how various U.S. agencies operate in the digital realm. Of particular interest was the roundtable conversation that focused on the question of whether contract law is well suited to “smart contract” applications – and if not, how it might have to be modified to reflect the tech world’s “code is law” paradigm and how that might look and operate.      One conclusion was that the code and the written word would likely have to run in parallel for quite some time.      The tricky thing about planning a blockchain-related event – and this is true as well of the blockchain course I teach at Fordham Law – is how quickly the industry landscape changes. In contrast, changes in the law take time and court cases to establish precedence even longer. We thought issues related to Libra would be front and center at the symposium but by the fall central banks’ digital currencies (CBDCs) had taken precedence as governments and the G7 stepped in to protect their turf and dominance over monetary policy. The panel on stablecoins discussed if the term had become toxic in the wake of the Libra hearings in Congress and concluded that CBDCs will remain a hot topic during 2020, especially with China looking to create one.      A more novel panel looked at corporate governance as it relates to shareholder voting and the blockchain, focusing in particular on the challenges, both practical and regulatory, public companies face in implementing blockchain solutions to improve the current system. Central to the conversation was what role financial market infrastructures (for example, DTCC or Broadridge) would play in blockchain-based securities record-keeping practices? How would moving from a three-day settlement affect liquidity? What are the tensions blockchain creates between investors – particularly activist investors – and companies that are interested in knowing more completely who their shareholders are? Blockchain technology is enabling public companies and financial institutions to reimagine a different landscape, which includes custody of digital security assets and instantaneous settlement.      One highlight of the day was a fireside chat with George Weiksner, the 13-year-old founder of Pocketful of Quarters, a cryptocurrency-based gaming platform. George is surely the youngest person ever invited to speak at Fordham Law, having spent an eighth of his life trying to get a “no-action” letter from the SEC for a token. He finally got the letter last July – one of 2019’s milestones – which will allow his company to solve a problem for online gamers, a $2.2 trillion industry, who have so many points/dollars locked into individual games.      As we head into 2020, there remain numerous regulatory issues that need to be clarified and coordinated for the blockchain industry to continue to innovate in the U.S. For one thing, we will need to navigate the implementation of the travel rule for cryptocurrencies and see how numerous regulatory agencies – SEC, CFTC, FINCEN – will act independently and collectively to provide guidance and new rule or policy making. We are also going to learn more about how central banks in other countries will approach digital currencies.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Donna Redel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/22/regulatory-issues-need-more-clarity-in-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/77b01032930425b1828914e7845abe834cad480d-842x887.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394463,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvsD4z,1577025000,Beyond Storage: How Custody Is Evolving to Meet Institutional Needs,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Diogo Monica is president and co-founder of Anchorage, crypto’s premier custodian for institutional investors.  The last few years have seen the formation of many crypto-focused hedge funds and venture capital funds, whose collective assets under management total in the billions of dollars: institutional investors including Blockchain Capital, BlockTower, Paradigm and Polychain, among others. These funds know the blockchain ecosystem as well as anyone in the world.  We’re grateful institutional investors who know crypto best are helping to inform the development of our custody product. Clients tell us what they need, and we partner with them to build what they require. Through this process, we’ve learned some lessons worth sharing because they offer meaningful insight into the crypto space and how it’s evolving.  1. Institutional investors want more from their custodian  Because digital assets are bearer assets, most investment activities involve handling the underlying private keys. This means custody plays a much bigger role in crypto investors’ day-to-day operations than in traditional finance. Whatever investors want to do with their assets – buy and hold, exit a major position, actively trade, participate in staking and governance – the custodian will be involved.  As such, institutional investors want custodians to make buying and selling digital assets as easy and painless as possible. What’s typically a multi-step process, including navigating exchanges and OTC dealers, finding the best price, manually transferring crypto from or to custody, is ripe for disruption by custodians. Regulated trading involves custody and custody relies on technology, which means providing even simple financial services (like the ability to buy, hold and sell an asset) requires highly advanced underlying infrastructure in the custody function.  Funds and institutions should be able to focus on their investment strategies without having to worry about security or moving millions of dollars in crypto between addresses. The onus is on custodians to enable their clients to sell or buy directly through custody.  2. Cold storage isn’t working for institutional use cases  Institutional investors are painfully aware of the major hot wallet breaches our industry has suffered and the chilling effect they’ve had on the whole ecosystem. To counteract the risks of online exposure, custodians have attempted to secure assets by generating and managing keys entirely offline through a manual human process called “cold storage.” Holding assets offline is necessary for security purposes, but institutional investors are frustrated with cold storage as it has traditionally been implemented.  Questioning the practicality of cold storage is not something we at Anchorage take lightly: As project leads for the Glacier Protocol, my co-founder and I helped develop a step-by-step method for bitcoin self-custody that relies on cold storage. Cold storage has been instrumental for the broader adoption of decentralized currencies, allowing people with non-technical backgrounds to safely store their crypto assets offline. It was and continues to be a sensible custody solution for many retail investors.  But cold storage comes with serious usability constraints, and institutional investors have complex usability needs that cold storage simply cannot satisfy.  For one, institutional investors have an obligation to their LPs to generate as much yield as possible on their behalf. Cold storage is an impediment to institutions’ ability to quickly execute trades. When a time-sensitive trading opportunity arises, custodians must be able to ensure that a client’s assets are readily accessible for trading at a moment’s notice. Traditional forms of cold storage can entail hours or even days of waiting to withdraw assets, at which point trading opportunities are lost. Institutional custody providers must develop solutions that make offline assets easily accessible and securely tradeable.  Second, institutional investors are demanding staking and governance, two forms of on-chain participation that require the use of private keys for online operations. Some cold storage custodians rely on delegation and proxy contracts, technologies that enable one key or contract to act on behalf of another. But not all projects allow delegated staking, and proxy contracts can increase surface-of-attack and introduce unnecessary risk.  As more projects come to market with mechanisms requiring active participation, institutional investors, which have a major stake in their investments’ health and success, will rely on their custodians to act accordingly and get the most out of their holdings.  3. Institutional investors require solutions designed for multi-person teams  The fact that institutional funds are managed collectively presents its own set of challenges. While “not your keys, not your crypto” has become a common refrain among adherents to the value of self-sovereignty, which individual should ultimately control crypto keys owned by an institutional fund?  We believe the keys must be controlled by a multi-person team. Providers are using different solutions to achieve this result: some use Shamir’s Secret Sharing (a cryptography algorithm that divides keys into multiple parts), others use physical controls. We at Anchorage associate a unique key with each user and require all sensitive operations to be signed by a quorum of user keys.  But multi-person approval is only part of the solution. The custodian must verify institutional intent – in other words, the custodian must ensure that a given operation represents what the client organization wants to do, and not just what a rogue individual or rogue group wants to do. We believe institutional intent is best verified by authenticating each human approver for a given operation, not just verifying possession of a shard or user key; and by enabling institutional investors to configure customizable quorums based on the nature of the operation, since different team members may have different domains of authority.  In sum, the role of custodians is evolving as the crypto ecosystem matures.  Institutional investors have different needs than retail users, while new coins that offer staking and governance demand on-chain participation. If the first wave of custody solutions was designed to help individuals hold and trade bitcoin, then the second wave will be trained on satisfying the needs of institutions and enabling full participation in all cryptocurrencies.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Diogo Mónica,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/22/beyond-storage-how-custody-is-evolving-to-meet-institutional-needs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15c5a8c87ef18e5e5e577907ad22585b35a44772-1340x844.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431329,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1jnh,1577023200,Crypto Needs More Lighthouse Customers,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Tony Sheng leads consumer venture investments at Multicoin Capital, an investment firm that invests in cryptocurrencies, tokens, and blockchain companies. Disclosure: Multicoin has invested in Tagomi, Bakkt, Torus, and holds MakerDao tokens at the time of publication.      Startups need users but getting users can be difficult if the startup offers something new and unfamiliar to the market. Users need to see how the startup’s product or service will benefit them before they change their behaviors.      That’s where lighthouse customers come in.      Lighthouse customers are early adopters whose successes attract other customers. Like a lighthouse guiding a ship to port, lighthouse customers guide potential customers through an uncertain buying process. The success of the lighthouse customers assuage the buyer’s fears the startup’s products won’t work or will make things worse.      In some ways, adoption in the crypto markets over the last few years has been disappointing. The frenzy of 2017 and 2018 promised a dismantling of legacy institutions and a wholesale replacement by utopian token networks. This promise connected into the belief that institutional investors were to arrive in herds, buying up all the digital assets in sight. Instead, we saw relatively little demand for “dapps” and a conspicuous lack of coin-buying herds.    Startups didn’t see lighthouses, only storms and shipwrecks.    I attribute some of this trepidation to a lack of lighthouses.      The best developers in the world will start to build on blockchains when they see companies creating real value, serving real customers and making real money. Instead, this year they saw a cacophony of debate about core infrastructure, failed research and development, and a number of “creative” capital formation experiments. They didn’t see lighthouses, only storms and shipwrecks.      Similarly, for institutions to really get involved in crypto they needed to see other institutions succeed at either allocating to the asset class or building on top of blockchain infrastructure. Trusted brands needed to offer tools like custody, pensions and endowments allocating to funds. Instead, they saw several false starts for a BTC ETF, muted allocations from the largest institutions and a lot of announcements about enterprise blockchains. But there were few, if any, signals of adoption.      But as I look into next year I see flashes of light. Across the industry I’ve found functioning lighthouses that can serve as a welcome for the next wave of users, developers, investors and customers.      On the application side, second-generation wallets such as Argent and Torus have made dramatic user experience improvements, lowering the barrier to entry for everyday users. For example, logging into Web3 applications using Torus is indistinguishable from the login flow for Web2 applications. Games like God’s Unchained and Skyweaver have introduced hundreds of thousands of gamers to digital assets through fun and rewarding gameplay. Crypto native browsers, namely Brave, with more than 10 million monthly active users, are taking off, creating a seamless gateway to all of the above. Permissionless financial systems including MakerDAO, Uniswap and Compound give people alternative ways to save, invest and manage their cash. For one of the brightest lighthouses of the year, look to Mariano Conti’s Devcon presentation where he shared how he lives entirely off a financial system he helped build, thereby sheltering his family from Argentina’s 50 percent inflation.      In addition to “crypto native” applications, we’re starting to see industry bets where founders are leveraging blockchain infrastructure to do things that were otherwise impossible in their sectors. For example, Helium uses crypto to incentivize a network of users to operate hotspots for wireless connectivity and Figure uses crypto to cut down the costs of originating home equity loans. These are businesses with the potential to reach massive markets.      On the institutional side, we are seeing institutional-grade products like Tagomi (prime brokerage), Coinbase Custody (custody) and Bakkt (futures exchange) hit the market. Despite the slow start, volumes are picking up. Bakkt’s monthly futures product has traded more than $120 million in only three months since launch. Pension funds and endowments have started allocating to crypto funds, showing the way for other institutional investors. Now, if institutions want to allocate money to crypto they don’t ask ""How?"" Instead, they can ask ""How much?”      In terms of overall awareness — and this is a big one that’s chronically ignored — despite the relatively rough performance of the asset class for practically all of 2019, cryptocurrencies were discussed in mainstream media all over the world thanks to the Libra congressional hearings and China's declared intentions to lead the world in blockchain innovation.      We go into the new year with sea lanes illuminated and tailwinds behind us. Just recently, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced an initiative to build an open protocol for social networks, a protocol he intends use with Twitter.

Bitcoin, by virtue of it being the first blockchain network brought into the mainstream and by being the largest digital asset by market capitalization, is often the first stop for many newcomers and likely will continue to be for the foreseeable future.      No. 2: Bitcoin is perhaps market beta, for now.      In traditional equity markets, beta is defined as a measure of volatility, or unsystematic risk an individual stock possesses relative to the systematic risk of the market as a whole. The difficulty in defining “market beta” in a space like digital assets is that there is no consensus for a market proxy like the S&P 500 or Dow Jones. Since the space is still very early in its development, and bitcoin has dominant market share (~68 percent at the time of writing), bitcoin is often viewed as the obvious choice for beta, despite the drawbacks of defining “market beta” as a single asset with idiosyncratic tendencies.      Bitcoin’s size and its institutionalization (futures, options, custody, and clear regulatory status as a commodity), have enabled it to be an attractive first step for allocators looking to get exposure (both long and short) to the digital asset market, suggesting that bitcoin is perhaps positioned to be digital asset market beta, for now.      No. 3: Despite slow conversion, substantial progress was made on growing institutional investor interest in 2019.      Education, education, education. Blockchain technology and digital assets represent an extraordinarily complex asset class – one that requires a non-trivial time commitment to undergo a proper learning curve. While handfuls of institutions have already started to invest in the space, a very small amount of institutional capital has actually made it in (relative to the broader institutional landscape), gauged by the size of the asset class and the public market trading volumes. This has led many to repeatedly ask: “when will the herd actually come?”      The reality is that institutional investors are still learning – slowly getting comfortable – and this process will continue to take time. Despite educational progress through 2019, some institutions are wondering if it’s too early to be investing in this space, and whether they can potentially get involved in investing in digital assets in the future and still generate positive returns, but in ways that are de-risked relative to today.      Despite a few other challenges imposed on larger institutional allocators with respect to investing in digital assets, true believers inside these large organizations are emerging, and the processes for forming a digital asset strategy are either getting started or already underway.      No. 4: Long simplicity, short complexity      Another trend we observed emerge this year was a shift away from complexity and toward simplicity. We saw significant growth in simple, passive, low-cost structures to capture beta. With the lowest-friction investor adoption focused on the largest liquid asset in the space – bitcoin – the proliferation of single asset vehicles has increased. These private vehicles are a result of delayed approval of an official bitcoin ETF by the SEC.      In addition to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, other bitcoin-focused products this year include the launch of Bakkt, the launch of Galaxy Digital’s two new bitcoin funds, Fidelity’s bitcoin product rollout, TD Ameritrade’s bitcoin trading service on Nasdaq via its brokerage platform, 3iQ’s recent favorable ruling for a bitcoin fund and Stone Ridge Asset Management’s recent SEC approval for its NYDIG Bitcoin Strategy Fund, based on cash-settled bitcoin futures.      We also observed a growing institutional appetite for simpler hedge fund and venture fund structures. For the last several years, many fundamental-focused crypto-native hedge funds operated hybrid structures with the use of side-pockets that enabled a barbell strategy approach to investing in both the public and private digital asset markets. These hedge funds tend to have longer lock-up periods – typically two or three years – and low liquidity. While this may be attractive from an opportunistic perspective, the reality is it’s quite complicated from an institutional perspective for reporting purposes.      No. 5: Active management has been challenged but differentiated sources of alpha are emerging.      For the year-to-date period ended Q3 2019, active managers were collectively up 30 percent on an absolute return basis according to our tracking of approximately 50 institutional-quality funds, compared to bitcoin being up 122 % over the same time period.      Bitcoin’s performance this year, particularly in Q2 2019, has made it clear that its parabolic ascents challenge the ability of active managers to outperform bitcoin during the windows they occur. Active managers generally need to justify the fees they charge investors by outperforming their benchmark(s), which are often beta proxies, yet at the same time they need to avoid imprudent risk behavior that can potentially have swift and sizable negative effects on their portfolios.      Interestingly, active management performance from the beginning of 2018 consistently outperformed passively holding bitcoin (with the exception of “opportunistic” managers who also take advantage of yield and staking opportunities, as of May 2019). This is largely due to various risk management techniques used to mitigate the negative performance drawdowns experienced throughout the extended market sell-off in 2018.      Although 2019 has challenged the large-scale success of these alpha strategies, they are nonetheless in the process of proving themselves out through various market cycles, and we expect this to be a growing theme in 2020.      No. 6: Token value accrual: Transitioning from subjective to objective      At the end of Q3 2019, according to dapp.com, there were 1,721 decentralized applications built on top of ethereum, with 604 of them actively used – more than any other blockchain. Ethereum also had 1.8 million total unique users, with just under 400,000 of them active – also more than any other blockchain. Yet, despite all this growing network activity, the value of ETH has remained largely flat throughout most of 2019 and is on track to end the year down approximately 10 percent at the time of writing (by comparison, BTC has nearly doubled in value over the same period). This begs the question: is ETH adequately capturing the economic value of the ethereum network’s activity, and DeFi in particular?      A new fundamental metric was introduced earlier this year by Chris Burniske – the Network Value to Token Value (“NVTV”) ratio – to ascertain whether the value of all assets anchored into a platform can be greater than the value of the base platform's asset.      The ETH NVTV ratio has steadily declined throughout the last few years. There are likely to be several reasons for this, but I think one theory summarizes it best: most applications and tokens built and issued atop ethereum may be parasitic. ETH token holders are paying for the security of all these applications and tokens, via the inflation rate that is currently given to the miners – dilution for ETH holders, but not for holders of ethereum-based tokens.      This is not a bullish or bearish statement on ETH; rather it is an observation of early signs of network stack value capture in the space.      No. 7: Money or not, software-powered collateral economies are here.      Another trend we observed this year is a larger migration away from “cryptocurrencies” in an ideological currency (e.g., money/payment and a means of exchange) sense, and toward digital assets for financial applications and economic utility. A form of economic utility that took the stage this year is the notion of software-powered collateral economies. People generally want to hold assets with disinflationary or deflationary supply curves, because part of their promise is that they should store value well. Smart contracts enable us to program the characteristics of any asset, thus it is not irrational to assume that it’s only a matter of time until traditional collateral assets get digitized and put to economic use on blockchain networks.      The benefit of digital collateral is it can be liquid and economically productive in its nature while at the same time serving its primary purpose (to collateralize another asset), yet without possessing the risks of traditional rehypothecation. If assets can be allocated for multiple purposes simultaneously, with the risks appropriately managed, we should see more liquidity, lower cost of borrowing, and more effective allocation of capital in ways the traditional world may not be able to compete with.      No. 8: Network lifecycles: An established supply side meets a quiet but emerging demand side.      Supply side services in digital asset networks are services provided by a third party to a decentralized network in exchange for compensation allocated by that network. Examples include mining, staking, validation, bonding, curation, node operation and more, done to help bootstrap and grow these networks. Incentivizing the supply side is important in digital assets to facilitate their growth early in their lifecycles, from initial fundraising and distribution through the bootstrapping phase to eventual mainnet launches.      While there has been significant growth of this supply side of the equation in 2019 from funds, companies, and developers, the open question is how and when demand for these services will pick up. Our view is that as developer infrastructure continues to mature and activity begins to move “up the stack” toward the application layer, more obvious manifestations of product-market fit are likely to emerge with cleaner and simpler interfaces that will attract high volumes of users in the process. In essence, it is important to build the necessary infrastructure first (the supply side) to enable buy-in from the end users of those services (the demand side).      No. 9: We are in the late innings of the smart contract wars.      While ethereum leads the space on adoption and moves closer to executing on its scalability initiatives, dozens of smart contract competitors fundraised in the market throughout 2018 and 2019 in an attempt to dethrone Ethereum. A handful have formally launched their chains and operate in mainnet as of the end of 2019, while many others remain in testnet or have stalled in development.      What’s been particularly interesting to observe is the accelerative pace of innovation – not just technologically, but economically (incentive mechanisms) and socially (community building) as well. We expect many more smart contract competitors operating privately as of Q4 2019 to launch their mainnets in 2020. Thus, given the incoming magnitude of publicly observable experimentations throughout 2020, if a smart contract platform does not launch in 2020, it is likely to become disadvantageously positioned relative to the rest of the landscape as it relates to capturing substantial developer mindshare and future users and creating defensible network effects.      No. 10: Product-market fit is coming, if not already here.      We don’t think human and financial capital would have continued pouring into the digital asset space in such great magnitude over the last several years if there wasn’t a focus on solving at least one very clear problem. The questionable sustainability of modern monetary theory is one of them, and Ray Dalio of Bridgerwater Associates has been quite vocal about it. Big Tech centralization is another. There are also growing global concerns related to data privacy and identity. And let’s not forget cybersecurity. The list goes on. We are at the tip of the iceberg as it relates to the products and applications blockchain technology enables, and mainstream users will come with growing manifestations of product-market fit. As more time and attention gets spent on diagnosing problems and working on solutions, the industry will begin to achieve its full potential. Facebook’s Libra and Twitter’s Bluesky initiative confirm that as an industry we are heading in the right direction.      A 2020 look ahead      We see 2020 shaping up to be one of the brightest years on record for the digital asset industry. To be clear, this is not a price forecast; if we exclusively measured the health of the industry from a fundamental progress perspective, by various accounts and measures we should have been in a raging bull market for the last two years, and that has not been the case. Rather, we expect 2020 to be a year of accelerated industry maturation.      Digital assets are still an emerging asset class with many quickly evolving narratives, trends, and investment strategies. It is important to note that not all strategies are suitable for all investors. The size of allocations to each category will and should vary depending on the specific allocator’s type, risk tolerance, return expectations, liquidity needs, time horizon and other factors. What is encouraging is that as the asset class continues to grow and mature, the opacity slowly dissipates and clearly defined frameworks for evaluation will continue to emerge. This will hopefully lead to more informed investment decisions across the space. The future is bright for 2020 and beyond.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Scott Army,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/22/institutional-investment-in-crypto-top-10-takeaways-of-2019,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/97ecd5190017152590d118ad7ba1961322e94131-1201x860.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431326,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1jZh,1577010900,Hanukkah Reflections on My Year of Toying With Bitcoin,"‘Tis the season for introspection. And this year, my thoughts are on bitcoin.      As Jewish people around the world celebrate Hanukkah this week, inspired by the ancient miracle that a sacred flame lasted for eight days although the oil supply was dangerously low, I’m pondering how the hell I’ll keep experimenting with this technology without burning the metaphorical candle at both ends.      I spent 2019 trying a variety of products and services to test how easy it is to actually use cryptocurrency. I ran a Casa bitcoin-lightning node, used decentralized exchanges (DEXs), moved bitcoin from mobile apps to a hardware wallet (a Ledger) then transacted straight from the hardware wallet.      Beyond just running the node, I used the Casa device to send invoices for a small product (a poetry book) to learn more about the challenges independent merchants might face. Lastly, I set up a BTCPay store, which is the stage of this experiment I’ll end the year on.      And after a year of educational tinkering what is my takeaway?      It’s this: There’s no way this technology is ready for prime time.      The most common refrain used to deflect from the technology’s obvious shortcomings is that it’s still “too early” to build for usability. Precisely because I agree it is still very early, here are some lessons I’ve learned about money fellow bitcoiners might want to keep in mind before evangelizing “to the moon” to the masses any time soon.    1. Bitcoin’s usability relies on social capital    Let’s start with what it took to sell a few poetry books using a bitcoin node.      There was an issue with my router, which I am terrible at describing other than saying something had to be configured with a “port” of sorts although the general internet connection worked fine. I clicked all the buttons.      If I didn’t have experienced engineers in my Rolodex of sources, I wouldn’t have gotten past that first hurdle. I called up two of the smartest engineers I know. We opened up the raw code and shared screens so they could see. They cursed vigorously, assuring me I was doing everything right according to the Casa tutorial blog. We updated the node with a wee bit of manual configuration and they graciously opened up a channel to me. (Lightning access doesn’t automatically offer two-way liquidity.)      Seasoned bitcoiners are generally able to find workarounds to overcome technical challenges (hardware wallet malfunction or incompatibility, incorrect updates, etc.). To be fair, the devices listed above are those I got to work (mostly) on my own. (I tried a few others and failed, which I won’t list because this isn’t a grouchy Yelp review.)      However, most command-line-only mountain men with their own custom setups don’t realize how fickle some products are at this stage. If you actually rely on bitcoin for business, many non-custodial products and services are so experimental you need tech support to operate them reliably. Why go the service-provider route at all with bitcoin? Be your own bank, remember?      Venmo works great. So does Stripe. Bitcoin needs to offer something different. (It does, of course. It might allow you to choose who you trust and what you trust them with, like bouncing a message across a mesh network, but we’ll get to that later.)    2. Failure to transact    Some people are surely using bitcoin today to improve their financial self-sovereignty. The idea that anyone could do so, however, is laughable.      Even when the wallet-node-DEX setup was working smoothly, just a few of my (relatively tech-savvy) customers could find their transaction data with blockchain explorers. Bitcoin is only transparent to people with the skills to read this data. Without that knowledge, there is no benefit added by the public ledger. (There may even be risks associated with this ledger.)      For the time being, I’d recommend any non-developer consider private consulting with an engineer (or membership to a startup service like Casa’s) as part of a crypto product’s price. That means you better expect to earn a pretty penny from bitcoiners as consumers (or savings liquidators) to make this worth it.      The trouble is, bitcoiners rarely want to spend their crypto. Herein lies the essential dilemma of bitcoin: It can’t be money without payments, it is seen as too valuable to spend (unless you are facing censorship) and official payment systems require compliance.      Some of the sharpest engineers I know in places like Iran still struggle to use bitcoin because there aren’t enough people to transact with. Skills alone don’t solve their legal problems. They also need a robust network of parties, both at home and abroad, who aren’t subject to the same compliance risks and government woes that caused their isolation in the first place.    3. Money is never trustless    Sanctions aside, all of these experiments reminded me of what it was like to get money in India during demonetization. Much like some token traders these days, when I was backpacking across India in 2016 my daily commerce relied on arbitrage. In short, social networks still control liquidity, whether it’s bitcoin or paper rupees.      I was at a camel festival in Rajasthan the first time I heard about demonetization. Indian businesses wouldn’t accept my bills any more.      Instead, travelers were told to exchange them for new bills at the sole local bank. But the government didn’t print enough new bills to cover the limited allotment each person was allowed per day (under $70).      When security guards came out with sticks to close the empty bank, the sunburnt and thirsty crowd grew rowdy. One guard grabbed a protester next to me by the face and shoved him to the ground.      So I turned to the black market. In the next town, a middle-aged man with a moustache and a mobile-phone shop had a secret stash of new rupees. He would swap dollars at a steep premium, despite the best efforts of a teenage boy from a nearby village who haggled in the local language on my behalf, for a small fee.      Sometimes even my dollars didn’t entice the currency dealer. This is the same issue Iranian bitcoiners face. Your currency is only valuable to people who believe they can also spend it in turn.      Like some bitcoiners in Venezuela who use cryptocurrency to get dollars today, foreigners turned to arbitrage during demonetization in India. Some businesses in 2016 charged foreigners less in euros than in dollars (with new rupees getting the lowest price of all), so we swapped among ourselves and developed relationships with business owners who would extend us short-term credit. Some banks and ATMs only had cash once a week. Premiums might fluctuate based on rumors of cash shipments on the horizon.      I started obsessively asking people how they managed their finances. Demonetization broke down stigmas around such topics, especially considering I was a petite traveler who could hardly bench press a housecat. From Pushkar to Varanasi and down south past Mumbai, most Indians told me they pooled their families’ wealth together with a single elder at the helm.      This echoes what is going on today in Lebanon and Iraq. In fact, the Indian outlet Economic Times referred to bitcoin as the “new hawala,” an ancient brokerage system often used for remittances. This social system almost resembles a mesh network.      Even in 2019, family networks are still the most popular financial networks. My bitcoin experiments got easier when I started treating cryptocurrency like black market rupees. It wasn’t about going trustless as much as it was compartmentalizing trust across a network of social ties.      Who could I trust to get me to the next step of my bitcoin experiment? They’d probably be exposed to my security setup if they helped circumnavigate some technical problems, but not others. Where was there opportunity for safe arbitrage?      Book buyers often trusted me with personal information, too, which I could have connected to their wallet addresses or online aliases if I was nefarious. How does one lawfully and privately get a book to a buyer living in rural Latin America? Can bitcoin really connect people to the global economy, including but not limited to digital products? If so, that process requires trust on both ends.    Conclusions, for now    None of this is to say bitcoin isn’t a global currency. The technology is already being used in this way. Transacting with wallets, especially European book-buyers, was the easiest part of my experiments.      Can cryptocurrency be used in a self-sovereign way, with minimal personal risks, to connect people who don’t already have access to safer, more robust financial products?      That I can’t say yet. It may depend on who burns the midnight oil in these early days, before prime time hits. Perhaps bitcoiners will be able to overcome the social challenges of money: compliance, access, liquidity, usability. By comparison, the technical shortcomings are almost trivial.      In 2020, I hope more people will try to transact outside their established networks and see what challenges they face in deliberately applying trust rather than eliminating it. Can we trust in the bitcoin network? This crazy idea should have failed long ago. Yet, for over a decade bitcoin has already proven to be the experiment that flickers but never goes dark, almost like a candle.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/22/hanukkah-reflections-on-my-year-of-toying-with-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/852c202edf7908fb987a4a7db9bc57e177b04018-2285x2151.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
