42381777,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pWod,1556141423,Samsung Invests $2.9 Million in Crypto Hardware Startup Ledger,"South Korean technology giant Samsung has invested 2.6 million euros ($2.9 million) into crypto hardware startup Ledger.  The investment gives the startup a valuation of roughly $290 million, French business magazine Capital reported Wednesday. A spokesperson for Ledger confirmed that Samsung backed the startup, but could not confirm further details. A Samsung representative did not respond to a request for comment by press time.  The news, coinciding with Ledger promoting Pascal Gauthier to CEO, follows previous funding rounds by the company, including a $7 million Series A fund raise in 2017 and a $75 million Series B in 2018. It is unclear whether Samsung's investment is part of a larger funding round.  Ledger's previous CEO and co-founder, Éric Larchevêque, confirmed the investment but declined to comment further, Capital reported. On Twitter, Larchevêque seemingly confirmed the news as well, saying in one tweet (translated from French) that ""We will always need hardware wallets, but to accompany a revolution crypto based on a personal sovereignty accessible to all, the smartphone will actually play a central role.""  According to his Twitter bio, Larchevêque now serves as Ledger's executive chairman.  A logical match  Ledger is currently working with various banks and other firms to offer a number of custody options. A custody venture with Japanese bank Nomura is expected to launch by 2020, while the hardware developer is simultaneously collaborating with Hong Kong-licensed Legacy Trust to offer custody services for ethereum-based tokens.  For its part, Samsung recently stormed into the crypto and blockchain space. It recently announced that a forthcoming new line of flagship smartphones – the Galaxy S10 series – will include crypto wallet functionality. And the company is now said to be working on its own unique blockchain based on ethereum.  Indeed, Samsung may one day issue its own token, according to CoinDesk Korea.  Ledger confirmed Samsung's investment Thursday, saying in a statement:  ""We are excited to confirm Samsung Ventures’ investment in Ledger. We believe Samsung Ventures will add value to further enhance our position as a leading provider of best-in-class security solutions as we continue to deliver innovative hardware wallet technology to meet the demands of both today’s and tomorrow’s mobile consumer market.""

42381785,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pWzx,1556139611,New Code Helps Lightning Users Protect Their Bitcoin from File Corruption,"Imagine this: Alice is one of the ""reckless"" users testing a new, risky technology.  She's excited about the potential for bitcoin's lightning, a technology that advocates hope will bring bitcoin payments to the masses. So, even though developers tell her it's risky to do so, she's running the technology on a little computer called a Raspberry Pi anyway, even using it to buy pizza.  But Alice's Raspberry Pi is having trouble, so she reboots her node to fix the problem. But when she turns it back on, she finds that a very important file had become corrupted when the computer shut down.  And now, all of Alice's funds are gone.  This troubling problem with lightning has happened to at least a few users. And it's one of the reasons using lightning today is considered not exactly safe to use. But thousands of users are ignoring this advice, sending payments across the network to see how the novel technology works in action.  Luckily, the sixth major release of the lightning implementation LND, released just last weekhttps://blog.lightning.engineering/announcement/2019/04/15/lnd-v0.6.html, aims to solve this problem by putting into place the change ""static backup channels"" as coded by Lightning Labs CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun.  As it stands, the fate of a user's money hinges on one file.  “What happens if your channel.db file gets corrupted? It’s pretty simple: All the funds in your channels are lost,” an explainer article from earlier this month by developer Patrick Lemke reads.  As Suredbits CEO Chris Stewart, who has also put together research on the topic, put it in conversation with CoinDesk:  ""Computers are finicky. Maybe your file system is deleted and you’re like shit, how do I get this money back?""  In practice, Osuntokun noted to CoinDesk that this mostly has happened to lightning enthusiasts using Raspberry Pis, which are little hardware devices that cost roughly $30 and are an easy way to stand up a lightning node at a low entry cost.  Saved by a copy  Losing money in this way is not very common, Stewart notes, but he argues that developers are working on ""worse case planning.""  There are three main implementations of lightning so far (including Blockstream's c-lightning and Acinq's Eclair) all of which have implemented this sort of a backup scheme in some form or another.  LND's new technology generates a second copy of the important file, allowing users to save an extra version of their lightning wallet file elsewhere, to minimize the risk of it getting lost or ""corrupted,"" meaning the data was accidentally altered, like staining a drip of coffee on a white shirt.  This is comparable to backing up all your computer files periodically to ensure they're safe even if the laptop takes its last steps or gets stolen.  With bitcoin, each transaction is stored in the blockchain, on thousands of nodes across the world. But with lightning, the off-chain transaction data is stored on your computer - and your computer alone. If you lose or ""corrupt"" the file storing state of the channels, then those funds are lost for good.  Another related scenario: if you accidentally use an old version of the channel.db, which turns out to have the wrong information, then your peer will probably think you're cheating. Thus, you'll be penalized, losing money.  That's why this new backup code is so important. To ensure safety of funds, a user needs to save their channel.db backup file in more than one place at once.  “If you run the latest version of LND your node will automatically create a backup of all the bits of information that you need to rescue your channels in case your channel.db file is lost,” Lemke explains.  ""We say safe, as care has been taken to ensure that there are no foot guns in this method of backing up channels, vs doing things like rsync ing or copying the channel.db file periodically. Those methods can be dangerous as one never knows if they have the latest state of a channel or not. Instead, we aim to provide a simple safe instead to allow users to recover the settled funds in their channels in the case of partial or complete data loss,"" Osuntokun explains in the ""pull request"" where he first proposed the change.  That said, Lemke stresses that users running the old lightning code are still at risk.  ""If you run an older version of LND your channels are not [safe] and you should be aware that you are at risk of losing your funds if your disk gets corrupted,"" he wrote.  Malicious peers  So, now that this code has been pushed through, is the problem solved?  Not exactly. As you can see, it's still a bit of a process for backing up the files. While the infrastructure LND puts into place automatically generates a backup file for users, the user still has to be technical enough to configure where to put it.  Not to mention, Stewart and Cohen point out one problem with the scheme: it's not completely trustless. Using this backup scheme, a malicious node could steal a counterparty's funds.  This feature is ""good for the average user who’s willing to trust that their peer is not malicious,"" Suredbits software engineer Nadav Cohen told CoinDesk, while Stewart noted that the backup solution should work ""99% of the time.""  But Stewart also highlighted how Suredbits has been working a lot with different exchanges that are looking to eventually adopt lightning.  ""For exchanges, they absolutely need to a [trustless backup scheme]. They're dealing with lots of money and don’t want to have the risk of losing a lot of funds,"" Stewart said.  Osuntokun has this scenario in mind too, noting that Lightning Labs developers are currently building out a feature that works even when a user is dealing with a malicious peer. In the meantime though, they released static backup channels, since they wanted to push out something that works for the most part.  ""This infrastructure will be built out in the near future, but until then we have this scheme which will also be a fall back in the scenario that any higher level mechanisms fail,"" Osuntokun explained.  In other words, there's still building to be done.  ""We're not there yet,"" as Stewart puts it, arguing there will be more of a need for this kind of feature in the future once people are using the network for even more money.  ""With wumbo, people will start transacting more. We need to be concerned in that case,"" he added, referencing a Spongebob Squarepants-inspired technology that will one day allow people to transfer even more money across lightning.  But once developers get this scheme working, Cohen argues that it shouldn't be hard to put something into place that's easier for users.  He said:  ""Backups are in the early stages and it’s a solvable problem. Once we have something that works and doesn't require trust, I don’t doubt that we can make them better as far as latency.""

42381786,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pX1D,1556121704,"View Ads, Get BAT: Brave Delivers on ICO Promise of Paid Web Browsing","Brave's promise to compensate you for viewing online ads is finally coming to fruition.  In a departure from typical display ads embedded on websites, the privacy-minded web browser is debuting small notifications that aren't wedded to particular sites. The notifications, visually akin to those of the Slack desktop app, feature promotional offers from different brands.  For users, it's important to note, the Brave Rewards product is opt-in.  ""This is what we're excited about because it doesn't require publisher opt-in,"" Brave CEO Brendan Eich told CoinDesk in an interview. ""The main model for us is advertiser-to-user.""  Describing the notifications as the ""top of the funnel,"" Eich explained that if the user clicks on one, they will be taken to a site with more information about the given offer.  Users can still keep using Brave without any kind of ad intervention, but they do have an incentive to join: Brave promises that 70 percent of the money companies spend on these ads will go to users (the rest is kept by Brave). The funds will be paid out to users' wallets via Brave's Basic Attention Token (BAT).  Brave Ads goes live today with a number of ad inventory suppliers, including Vice, Home Chef, ConsenSys, Ternio BlockCard, MyCrypto, eToro, BuySellAds, TAP Network, The Giving Block, AirSwap, Fluidity and Uphold.  “Brave is changing the paradigm of digital advertising where consumers are fairly rewarded for their attention,"" Lin Dai, CEO of TAP Network, said in a statement. TAP brings over 250,000 partner merchants and brands to the new platform, according to Brave.  Traditional online advertising works by monitoring web users' behavior, reporting that to the cloud and picking ads to serve them based on that data.  ""We turn tracking on its head,"" Eich said.  A catalog of potential ads is served to the browser as a very light file and the browser, locally, follows user behavior and picks ads to show based on that. Crucially, the Brave browser never reports out data on user behavior.  ""It's a private ad system that doesn't involve tracking on the front side,"" Eich said. ""It can pick ads that are specific to you based on your browser data.""  So, advertisers will still get the targeting they want, but they will have to rely on machine learning built into the Brave browser itself, rather than user activity stored in the cloud and compiled over time.  Getting paid  To start earning BAT for letting these notifications pop up, users need to make sure they are using the latest version of Brave.  Brave's BAT offering was the original sold-out-in-seconds initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017, selling $35 million in BAT less than a minute. Like most ICOs of that era, there was a gap between distributions and the real-world usefulness of tokens.  Brave first gave users a way to use BAT by letting them donate funds to websites based on how often they visited them (the program actually began with bitcoin). In November 2017, the payment functionality was even extended to the level of specific YouTube personalities.  The new ads feature is actually an extension of the existing donation product. Currently, Brave Rewards users either add funds themselves or accept grants from Brave, and the BAT in their wallet is redistributed to the websites they visit. When Brave Ads kicks in, it will default to accumulating BAT for redistribution to publishers in the same fashion, unless the user changes the defaults.  Though the Brave browser blocks ads and trackers by default, Eich argues that this new product will start feeding funds out to its 55,000 verified publishers because he expects most users who opt-in will leave the defaults on, as most web users do.  ""I think users are going to let it ride,"" he said.  Later, the company hopes to integrate tracker-less ads on websites and offer publishers a simple micropayment solution so users could pay for an individual post rather than subscribing.  The project has been slowly starting to gain traction with major name-brand news sites.  When withdraw  Users can earn, but spending is going to take a little longer.  ""If our users started taking BAT out on their own initiative, we would be defrauded overnight massively,"" Eich told CoinDesk.  The reason for the delay: the company is still working to build up its know-your-customer (KYC) solution. So for now, earned BAT can only be used to support publishers. Users should be able to buy premium content and maybe specific products from vendors with BAT soon, Eich said.  Once KYC is in place, that should be enough of a hurdle to decrease fraud risk sufficiently, he added.  Further, Brave is working with its settlement partners, such as Uphold and Coinbase, so that when users can withdraw, they can withdraw to fiat if they prefer.  Eich said in a statement:  “With Brave Ads, we are launching a digital ad platform that is the first to protect users’ data rights and to reward them for their attention.”  Brave Ads launches today in the U.S., Canada, France, Germany and the U.K.  Correction (April 24, 16:35 UTC): Brave has 55,000 verified publishers, not 25,000, as was reported in an earlier version of this story.

Revealing the news exclusively to CoinDesk on Wednesday, the firm said its TrueAUD token is now live and backed 1:1 by the Australian dollar. Cryptocurrency exchanges can ""immediately"" start listing TrueAUD, and users can purchase and redeem the stablecoin via its app at no cost, it added.  TrueAUD is based on similar legal and technical standards to its dollar-pegged sibling TrueUSD. The firm pledged it will hold collateralized funds in a third-party escrow account and provide regular attestations of the AUD backing by third-party accounting firm Cohen & Co.  Keen to avoid issues with transparency like those that have plagued the most popular stablecoin issuer Tether, which has never provided a full audit of its USD backing, TrustToken last month partnered with accounting firm Armanino to allow traders using its stablecoins to have a “real-time” view of the reserves backing all its tokens.  In March, Tether had conceded that the collateral backing its USDT token may not be 100 percent in actual U.S. dollars.  TrustToken launched a stablecoin pegged to the British pound (TrueGBP) earlier this month, and further offers its U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin (TrueUSD), which was launched in March 2018. At the time, the firm said it plans to launch more such products linked to the yen as well as other fiat currencies in the future.  Coming soon, on a similar basis, are two other tokens backed by Canadian dollars and Hong Kong dollars (TrueCAD and TrueHKD, respectively) that will launch in Q2. A euro version (TrueEuro) is due in Q3.  TrustToken is backed by Andreessen Horowitz's cryptocurrency fund A16z Crypto, having raised $20 million in a strategic token sale last June. The firm has adopted the mission to act as a ""bridge between blockchains and $256 trillion worth of real-world assets.""

42381784,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pWyh,1556114406,China's Foreign Exchange Regulator Piloting Blockchain in Trade Finance,"The agency that regulates and manages China's foreign exchange reserves has developed a blockchain system aimed to address inefficiencies in cross-border trade finance.  As reported by local financial news source CNStock, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) worked with the Hangzhou Blockchain Technology Research Institute to build the open blockchain platform, which uses multi-signature technology to keep transaction content private, revealing details only to the firms involved and regulators such as those relating to customs, taxation, industry and commerce.  Traditionally, China's import and export financing uses a manual, paper-based operation for processing a hugely complex industry and that brings low efficiency, commonplace errors, high operational risk and, thus, elevated cost of financing. Putting the financial data on a distributed network enables information to be shared transparently and in real-time, according to the report.  The forex watchdog's blockchain platform takes a focus on export receivables – the funds owed to a company by a foreign buyer after delivery – allowing firms to enter data on financing, audits, loans repayments and so on, and manages the entire process. It further automatically verifies customs documents and calculates a final balance for the customs declaration, a factor that prevents double or excessive financing, according to the report.  With initial development now complete, SAFE will now pilot the blockchain platform in three major trading provinces – Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian – and two cities, Shanghai and Chongqing, CNStock indicates.  The pilot will run for six months and is expected to be taken nationwide going forward, with many banks said to be involved in the scheme.

The newly supported coins are Binance’s native token Binance Coin (BNB) and three stablecoins – Gemini dollar (GUSD), Tether (USDT) and Circle's USD Coin (USDC) – Chainalysis said Wednesday.  “As a New York trust company, we are required to monitor transactions onto and off of our platform,"" said crypto exchange Gemini’s chief compliance officer, Michael Breu. ""Automated solutions like Chainalysis help us fulfill our regulatory obligations.”  The additions mean Chainalysis' anti-money laundering compliance solution, Chainalysis KYT (Know Your Transaction), now supports a total of 10 cryptocurrencies. The solution already supported six cryptocurrencies: bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC) and the stablecoins TrustToken's TrueUSD and Paxos Standard (PAX).  The support of additional cryptocurrencies comes in anticipation of regulatory guidance from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global money-laundering watchdog, which will provide clarity on how cryptocurrencies should be regulated over 180 countries, Chainalysis said.  The startup's co-founder and chief operating officer, Jonathan Levin, told CoinDesk:  “Chainalysis is prepared to equip businesses with automated transaction monitoring for currencies beyond bitcoin. We expect that the launch of these multiple currency capabilities will help shape FATF guidance on the sector and help move away from technically infeasible solutions to more pragmatic recommendations.”  With Chainalysis having recently rebuilt its technology to scale and support more blockchains, the firm will be able to add new cryptocurrencies more quickly, Levin added in the announcement.  The startup's blockchain investigation tool, Chainalysis Reactor, now also supports the same 10 cryptocurrencies, which it says represent 85 percent of the top 25 coins by trading volume.  Just last week, Chainalysis published a public comment letter in response to a draft recommendation by the FATF, saying that it is unrealistic and potentially harmful for the crypto industry to expect exchange platforms to send know-your-customer (KYC) information to recipient platforms with every transaction.  Founded in 2014, the firm recently raised a total of $36 million in a multi-stage Series B funding backed by notable investors, including Japan’s largest bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) and venture capital firm Accel Partners.

42402848,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddC7s,1556107244,New York State Sees First Conviction for Crypto Money Laundering,"A case involving millions of dollars in bitcoin and Western Union payments has resulted in New York State's first conviction for cryptocurrency money laundering.  The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office announced Wednesday that defendants Callaway Crain and Mark Sanchez, both 35, laundered $2.8 million earned through sales of controlled substances carried out over the internet.  Between 2013 and 2018, the two men sold steroids and other drugs including Viagra across the U.S. via their website “NextDayGear” and on the dark web. They sold over 10,000 packages and accepted payments in cryptocurrency and fiat currency via Western Union, which they then laundered.  Customers usually paid in bitcoin, the Attorney’s Office said, with the defendants laundering the proceeds via one or more ""intermediary"" cryptocurrency wallets to obfuscate the source of the funds. The bitcoin was then converted to U.S. dollars using a cryptocurrency exchange platform before the cash was deposited into their bank accounts.  Western Union payments, on the other hand, were laundered through the use of false identities or international wire transfers from receivers outside of the U.S..  The duo has now pleaded guilty and faces a jail term of 2.5–7.5 years, with sentencing expected to take place on July 12.  Manhattan District Attorney, Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., said:  “These defendants raked in crypto and cash worth millions on their full-service website that sold prescription-free counterfeit steroids and other controlled substances to customers in all 50 states.”  “Online drug sellers who do business in New York should take note: whether you’re operating in plain sight or in hidden corners of the dark web, my Office has the skills and resources to follow the money, shut down your business, and hold you accountable,” Vance warned.  Just last week, the same DA’s office also indicted three individuals for dealing in drugs and laundering $2.3 million in cryptocurrency by using preloaded debit cards and withdrawing cash at ATMs in Manhattan and New Jersey.

42402860,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddCFk,1556103639,"Litecoin Led Bitcoin's Price Rally, Now It’s Hinting at a Pullback","View  Bitcoin could fall back to $5,000 in the next few days, as litecoin – which guided markets higher in the first quarter – is showing signs of weakness.  Bitcoin’s long/short ratio has dropped well below 1.00 for the first time since Jan.1, signaling growing bearish sentiment. Further, the 14-day relative strength index is teasing a bearish divergence. Therefore, a price pullback looks likely.  The case for a drop to $5,000 would weaken if the price bounces up from the ascending 10-day moving average, currently at $5,303.  Bitcoin (BTC) could be in for a sudden price pullback, as litecoin (LTC), which doubled in value in the first quarter and led the crypto markets higher, is now showing signs of weakness.  BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, hit a five-month high of $5,627 yesterday and is currently trading at $5,450 on Bitstamp, representing a 1 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. That figure, however, is still up 10 percent from the low of $4,940 registered on April 15.  While BTC scored double-digit gains in the last 10 days, litecoin, the world’s sixth largest cryptocurrency, fell 13 percent. At press time, LTC is trading at a three-week low of $73 on Bitstamp.  If there is indeed a correlation between price trends of the two cryptocurrencies, litecoin’s bearish divergence is bad news for BTC, as seen in the chart below.  Bitcoin and litecoin daily charts  Both litecoin and bitcoin pretty much moved in tandem from mid-December to the end of January.  The crypto market leader, bitcoin, picked up a bid near $3,100 on Dec. 15 and jumped to highs above $4,200 on Dec. 24. Further, BTC charted a bullish higher low near $3,300 in the first week of February, confirming seller exhaustion.  Litecoin also bottomed out at $22 in mid-December, but charted a bullish higher low near $29 on Jan. 22 – two weeks before BTC did the same. Subsequently, LTC broke into a bull market with a head-and-shoulders bullish reversal with a 30 percent gain on Feb. 8.  By mid-March, LTC was reporting a 100 percent gain on this year’s opening price of $30, while BTC remained stuck in the bear market below $4,000. Notably, the longer-term bull breakout for BTC happened on April 2 – almost two months after litecoin’s inverse head-and-shoulders breakout.  So, LTC appears to have led bitcoin higher in the first 3.5-months of the year and its recent weakness, as discussed above, might end up dragging BTC lower.  It's worth noting that LTC is set to undergo mining reward halving in August this year, while BTC’s halving event is due sometime in May 2020. Both BTC and the broader markets are likely to track the action in the LTC market in the near future.  BTC, therefore, risks falling back to $5,000 over the next few days, and the bullish higher high established yesterday with a close above $5,466 (April 10) may fail to yield an immediate rally to $6,000.  Backing that argument is the ratio of long/short positions, which is now reporting bearish bias with a reading well below the 1.00 mid-line.  Bitcoin’s long/short ratio  As seen above, the long/short ratio has dropped to 0.8686, the lowest level since Jan. 1.  Other technical studies are also calling a pullback. For instance, the recent ""golden crossover"" of the 50-day moving average (MA) and the 200-day MA – is accompanied by the overbought readings on the 14-day relative strength index, as discussed yesterday.  Further, the 14-day RSI is beginning to diverge in favor of the bears.  Daily chart: Focus on RSI  The RSI will end up confirming a lower high if BTC ends in the red today. The resulting bearish divergence – a higher high on price and lower high on the RSI – would further strengthen the case for a correction.

The fund is targeted at institutional and professional investors to give them “convenient access"" to bitcoin mining, Bitfury announced in a blog post Wednesday.  Traditionally, there have been “technological, logistical, financial and execution risk challenges” with access to bitcoin mining, the firm said, adding that the fund aims to address those challenges with an offering that has now been authorized by a European financial watchdog. Which particular regulator was not specified, however.  The fund will invest in turnkey assets consisting of mining sites with some of the “lowest electricity and operating costs globally,” scouted and operated by Bitfury, which specializes in manufacturing cryptocurrency mining infrastructure and also mines itself.  Claiming that the fund has been launched at an “advantageous” time for investors, Final Frontier co-founder, Imraan Moola, said:  “With the bitcoin price down significantly from its all-time high, yet institutional interest growing every day, now may be an opportune time to consider investing in bitcoin mining.”  Bitfury’s executive vice-chairman George Kikvadze said that the fund will help investors “strengthen” their portfolios and bring bitcoin closer to mainstream adoption.  Earlier this year, Bitfury partnered with South Korean R&D firm Commons Foundation to jointly launch a network of bitcoin mining operations in Paraguay.  Bitfury is also reportedly considering an initial public offering (IPO) in Amsterdam, London or Hong Kong, possibly to be held this year. The firm raised $80 million in November, in a round led by venture capital firm Korelya Capital, with Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital, Macquarie Capital and Dentsu Inc. also participating.

An exclusive CoinDesk Korea report on Tuesday, citing a person ""familiar with Samsung's internal situation,” said that the company’s blockchain task force – part of its wireless division – is building a blockchain mainnet based on ethereum. The work, however, is still at the “internal experimental” stage.  The source said:  ""Currently, we are thinking of private blockchain, though it is not yet confirmed. It could also be public blockchain in the future, but I think it will be hybrid – that is, a combination of public and private blockchains.”  When the development of the blockchain is completed, Samsung may also move to launch a “Samsung Coin” token, according to the report.  The person said:    ""The market expects Samsung Coin to come out, but the direction has not yet been decided.""            If the company develops a public blockchain in the future, then Samsung Coin could be traded publicly on cryptocurrency exchanges just like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). Samsung could also bring blockchain technology to its payments app Samsung Pay, but the move is not yet decided, according to the source.  Samsung’s blockchain task force has been in active development for at least a year, and is working on a number of projects, according to the report.  Two months ago, the company made a leap into the blockchain arena with the unveiling of its flagship cellphone, the Galaxy S10, which has the ability to store cryptocurrency private keys and other features such as support blockchain-based digital signatures.  In March, Samsung officially revealed the cryptocurrency wallet, which is compatible with ether (ETH) and ethereum-based ERC20 tokens, although notably not bitcoin in early glimpses. According to some reports, the wallet is not yet available in some jurisdictions.  The S10 also supports decentralized apps (dapps) such as crypto gaming platform Enjin, beauty community Cosmee, crypto collectibles platform CryptoKitties and merchant payments service CoinDuck.

42402846,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddC2x,1556092832,"The Ethereum Name Service Is Turning Nearly 300,000 .ETH Domains Into NFTs","An effort to build a domain name system on top of the ethereum blockchain network is gearing up for a major upgrade early next month -- and the project's developers are urging stakeholders to prepare.  At the heart of the upgrade is the replacement of the Ethereum Name Service's registrar, with the goal of vastly speeding up the process of registering .eth, .xyz, and .lux domain names. What's more, names registered on the ENS will be treated as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), allowing them to be bought and exchanged like similar kinds of tokens on the ethereum network.  During an April 16 blog post, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) lead developer Nick Johnson wrote that registered domain users have one year after May 4 to migrate their domain to a new registar that is replacing the existing one.  The service first launched back in May 2017, allowing users to register .eth domain names and link them to ethereum resources such as smart contracts, wallet addresses, and more. This is a particularly useful application given the complex naming system attached to such resources.  Since inception, more than 270,000 domain names have been set up using the ethereum domain .eth, according to Brantly Milegan. the developer coordinator for ENS.  And data from Curious Giraffe shows the economic impact -- that is, how people are actually using the network's native ETH token to participate. To wit: nearly 800,000 auctions have been started, drawing in 3.2 million ETH worth of bids and a total of about 170,000 ETH locked up (successful bids are locked up in a contract so long as the bidder holds the domain itself). Much of that activity was seen in the earliest days of the project.  Now, Johnson and the team at ENS are looking ahead to improving the domain name registration system in major ways.  What's changing  First, as opposed to waiting roughly five days for a domain name to be registered, users of the new ENS system will be able to complete orders within a minute.  “Registering a name is nearly instant,” according to Johnson. “Users submit two transactions, first committing to registering the name, then actually registering the name. In order to prevent front-running, these two transactions must be mined at least 1 minute apart.”  ENS developer relations coordinator Brantly Milegan added that this speedy registration process was made possible by replacing the service's ""blind auction process"" with ""instant [domain] registration.""  Milegan told CoinDesk:  ""The reason we had an auction process is because we thought that was the most fair way to have an initial distribution of domains...We're now moving to instant registration because we're assuming that if there was a valuable domain it's already been contested through auction.""  Once registered, domain names will be treated as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that just like any other unique asset on the ethereum blockchain can be easily collected and transferred between users.  ""[ENS names] were always non-fungible but they'll have the same properties as other NFTs, they will plug into other NFT systems,"" Milegan explained.  Thirdly, the new ENS system will eventually be opening up a three-step allocation process similar in part to the blind auction process for domain names shorter than seven characters. Finally, for all domain names longer than seven characters, users will have to pay an annual fee of $5 in order to guarantee ownership over the name.  “Imposing a cost on name registrations is necessary to limit ‘land grabs,’” explains Johnson in his blog post. “The interim registrar achieved this with a deposit based scheme...But experience has shown us that this is less effective than we had hoped.”  Input sought  Milegan estimates that the forthcoming yearly rent will amount to roughly $250,000 starting sometime in 2020.  As stated in a Reddit AMA about the forthcoming ENS upgrade, funds will initially be sent “to the ENS root multisig wallet for the key holders to determine how to allocate funds.”  Milegan explained in a blog post published April 19:  “What this means is whatever four of these seven people can agree to do with the ETH from the yearly rent is what will happen to it.”  The seven individuals in charge of collectively managing the ENS root multisig include Johnson, two individuals from the Ethereum Foundation, CEO of crypto wallet application MyCrypto, founder of ethereum mobile client Status, software developer at Consensys, and lead engineer at blockchain startup Colony.  Before the introduction of rent fees, these individuals were actually primarily tasked “to facilitate the possibility of upgrades and maintenance and in exceptional circumstances to handle problems with the ENS,” as stated on the official website. Now, these keyholders are looking for feedback from the community about how best to allocate future funds from a yearly rent model.  Ultimately, however, the intention will be to migrate away from a multisig system entirely and create “some form of distributed decision-making process” to takeover the task of both ENS fund management and system administration.  As stated by Aron Fischer – lead engineer at blockchain startup Colony – on Twitter:  ""The ultimate goal, is and has always been, to get rid of (the need for) the multisig...Ideally, the permanent registrar eventually reaches a level of maturity which obviates the need for any entity having the permissions to change its code.

Alexei Navalny, a politician believed by many to be President Vladimir Putin's main opponent, has attracted more than 591 BTC in donations over the last three years, worth about $3 million at current prices, public blockchain data shows.  The donations became a flashpoint this week when a pro-Putin television network questioned their timing.  Navalny's investigative center, the Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), regularly publishes exposés of government officials, including prime minister Dimitri Medvedev and attorney general Yuri Chaika.  On Monday, an anonymous Telegram channel, ""FBK Staffer's Confession,"" noted that the Navalny organization's wallet received several large donations a few days before FBK published one such investigation, insinuating it was a paid hit piece. The claim was covered in Russian media, including the pro-Putin Tsargrad TV.  When contacted by Russian news publication Znakhttps://www.znak.com/2019-04-22/v_shtabe_navalnogo_prokommentirovali_publikacii_o_platezhah_na_bitkoin_koshelek, FBK's chief of staff Leonid Volkov denied any connection between the transactions and its investigations, saying the anonymous blogger ""dragged the non-existent facts together in by the head and shoulders.""  Volkov added:  ""You can say that each time Encke's Comet approaches the Earth it coincides with a big war: 1914 (First World War), 1941 (World War II) and 2014 (War on Eastern Ukraine). But its rotation period is three years, and it approached the Earth many times when there were no big wars.""  Funding dissent  The Navalny wallet (3QzYvaRFY6bakFBW4YBRrzmwzTnfZcaA6E, listed on the donations page of his website) received its first bitcoin in December 2016 and since then has seen more than 2,000 transactions, including withdrawals, according to blockchain data.  Most transactions were worth from a fraction of a bitcoin to several bitcoins. From time to time, larger transactions occurred, bringing in up to 20 BTC at once.  Yet Navalny's political movement, which also accepts donations via bank transfers and PayPal, is not the only dissenting voice in Russia to take cryptocurrency.  Investigative outlets including Zona.Media and The Insider, as well as internet freedom movement Roskomsvoboda, accept donations in bitcoin or ether.
