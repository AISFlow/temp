42423211,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2XIlh,1653951784,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Jumps Above $31K; Crypto Carbon Trading Races to Clean Up Act,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin jumps more than 7%, and some crypto market analysts are asking if the bottom is in.  Insights: Crypto carbon trading firms are looking to address problems that have plagued them.  Technician's take: BTC remains in a choppy trading range with limited upside.

Bitcoin posts biggest daily price rise in two months, as crypto markets rally broadly  Traditional markets were mostly closed in the U.S. on Monday for a holiday, but bitcoin (BTC) didn't rest.  The largest cryptocurrency jumped more than 7% to about $31,500, in its biggest gain since March 9.  The sudden burst higher came as bitcoin had just completed a record nine-week losing streak that took the price down to around $29,400 from $37,600.  Now crypto analysts are starting to ask if the market is finding a bottom after the latest downdraft.  According to the blockchain analysis firm Glassnode, the recent selling pressure might be easing up. ""The price action appeared to have bottomed for the time being,"" Glassnode wrote Monday in its Uncharted newsletter.  Almost all major cryptocurrencies were in the green, with Cardano's ADA gaining some 17% and leading the CoinDesk 20.  Markets  (Most traditional markets were closed in the U.S. on Monday for an official holiday.)  Insights  Crypto carbon credit protocols look to improve  Like all things crypto, blockchain-based carbon credit protocols have had a tough go of it during the last quarter. They have been subject to the same market pressure as the rest of the industry, which is struggling to regain its footing since the Terra collapse.  But the sector’s challenges are not just to do with market dynamics. It’s also facing an internal reckoning after questions emerged about the quality of the credits being traded inside the base carbon tokens (BCT) issued on the Toucan protocol, which led Verra, a hybrid standards agency and registry responsible for carbon credits, to take a hard look at the practice.  In April, researchers at Carbon Plan, a California-based climate data non-profit, published a paper titled “Zombies on the Blockchain,” which outlined how approximately 28% of the Verified Carbon Units (VCU) traded in BCTs on the Toucan Protocol and via carbon trading KlimaDao were from “zombie projects.”  “Toucan appears to be generating entirely new demand for long-neglected credits that have experienced little or no demand in recent years,” the researchers wrote. “When the crypto market places higher value on BCTs and KLIMA tokens, these products can bring formerly defunct offset projects back to life.”  CarbonPlan highlights in its post that carbon credits under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement prohibit the trading of credits from carbon offset projects registered before Jan. 1, 2013. Yet, these older projects are being actively traded on the Toucan protocol and were still being tokenized as late as November 2021.  “Rather than eliminate supply from the voluntary market, however, zombie projects show that BCTs are bringing new supplies into existence – not in the form of new projects, but of old credits that weren’t previously able to find any buyers,” CarbonPlan’s researchers wrote. “Thanks to demand from blockchain buyers, however, these low-quality credits found new life.”  Aside from the issue of “zombie projects,” the other problem with these projects is structural. The industry has been commodifying what’s called “retired” credits.  When firms want to offset their emissions, they use this process to purchase credits and retire them from the market. In turn, they get a receipt that makes the basis of their published carbon offset and BCT tokens.  In an interview with S&P Global, Robin Vix, Verra’s chief legal, policy and markets officer, called this entire process “mind frying” as the company plans to disconnect the Toucan protocol from buying retired credits.  ""Verra will, effective immediately, prohibit the practice of creating instruments or tokens based on retired credits on the basis that the act of retirement is widely understood to refer to the consumption of the credit's environmental benefit,"" Verra's statement said.  Vix said to S&P Global that Verra will start scrutinizing stakeholders' requests for retired carbon credits and block anything it suspects of being associated with tokenization.  “Carbon credits themselves are abstract intangible things based on counterfactuals of things that you can't actually see – emissions. And then crypto is another layer of abstraction on top of that,” Vix said.  But all this isn’t to say that Verra is entirely opposed to the tokenization and trading of carbon credits or that Toucan is not cognizant of the structural flaws of the arrangement.  Verra said that it is exploring ways to ""immobilize"" current – not retired – carbon credits so they can be bridged over to Toucan or other exchanges to trade.  ""The initial thinking is that the best way of doing this is if these tokens somehow tie back to live, unretired credits so that the environmental benefit hasn't yet been used,"" Rix said to S&P Global. ""In other words, if you're acquiring tokens or coins, you always know that the underlying [offset] is there.""  In an interview with CoinDesk, Rob Schmitt, one of Toucan’s core developers, emphasized that this isn’t about Verra blocking tokenization; rather, Verra just wants to make the process better.  Schmitt said that bridging and trading retired carbon credits weren’t ideal but just a first step. Once Verra introduces the ability to immobilize credits it would mean that credits could be sent bi-directionally from Toucan back off-chain, creating price parity.  “This will be very positive for the on-chain markets,” he said. “  Schmitt is also aware of Carbon Plan’s paper on zombies. He points to a post from Toucan called ""Raising Standards in the On-Chain Carbon Market"" that outlines the protocol’s filtering plan to only offer credits less than 10 years old.  “The obsession over age isn’t necessarily what’s correct here … if you took a climate action one year, it’s the same action the next. It’s not going to be different,” he said. “The issue with these credits is it's questionable whether these projects needed the funding from carbon credits to get going.  “But it’s an issue we inherited from Vera.”  CoinDesk TV  In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:  Ether, DeFi Under Pressure, Fmr Binance Exec on Launching Crypto Fund Amid Market Downturn  JJ Kinahan of Tastytrade joins ""First Mover"" to provide his crypto markets analysis as investors brace for more pain amid Fed rate hike pressure.

This has sparked speculations as to what will actually trigger another bull rally for the pioneer cryptocurrency. Billionaire Tim Draper who has always been vocal when it comes to his thoughts about the crypto market has weighed in on this and put forward what he believes will be the defining factor for the next bitcoin bull market. Women Are The Key It is no surprise that more women are moving into the market. Even though males still disproportionately dominate crypto investing, the number of women moving into the space has been on the rise, reaching as high as one in every three investors now being a woman.

At this pace, bulls could surge to retest Q1 2022 lows at $12. Past Performance of WAVES After a 93 percent dump from April 2022 highs, WAVES crypto prices have found a base in late May 2022 and are pumping. As per the WAVES technical analysis in the daily chart, the coin is up 28 percent in the last 24 hours, outperforming the USDT and BTC. WAVES Technical Analysis Prices appear to be recovering after sharp losses in the last two months, according to WAVES technical analysis. At press time, the bullish engulfing bar of May 30 has high trading volumes suggesting interest. Considering the WAVES token candlestick arrangement settings in the daily chart, buyers can load on dips inside the May 30 trade range above $4. More opportunities will be presented if there are confirming gains above the middle BB. From the daily chart, the immediate target for bulls is at $8 or Q1 2022 highs. This level is also the liquidation level that, if buyers close above, would nullify the bear breakout formation of May 11 and 12. What to Expect from WAVES?

It was amplified on Twitter by “@FatManTerra” Monday afternoon.  According to FatMan, who has been providing commentary on the Terra research forum for the past few weeks, the latest exploit has allegedly drained over $2 million, with the potential for more, due to a bug in the LUNC pricing oracle.

BEL crypto is up 4.2X from 2022 lows. Bulls could break above April 2022 highs in coming sessions. Past Performance of the Bella Protocol The Bella Protocol token is ripping higher at spot rates, adding an impressive 60 percent on average against BTC, ETH, and USDT in the past 24 hours. Overall, buyers are in the driving seat as the BEL crypto token is back to April 2022 highs. Bella Protocol Technical Analysis According to Bella Protocol technical analysis, buyers are in control, bottoming out at spot rates. The surge in crypto prices in the past trading week is a massive boost for BEL token bulls considering double-digit losses from April highs. At spot rates, BEL crypto bulls may find entries to load. However, since the token is up roughly 4.2X from 2022 lows, traders may wait for a breakout above $1.30 to load on the bullish breakout. Further gains may prepare Bella Protocol coin prices for a leg up towards $2.30 or H2 2021 highs in a bullish continuation pattern. What to Expect from BEL? Technically, the coin is bottoming up after breaking above the middle BB. The BEL crypto is up a massive 4.2X from 2022 lows and may post more gains in the days ahead.

Sushi and the Kava Ignition Fund will allocate up to $7 million over 90 days for a combined $14 million as part of the partnership.  Kava launched its $185 million Ignition Fund last year to support DeFi projects and onboard new projects.  “The $750M Kava Rise incentives program is empowering developers on Sushi to build exciting new DeFi applications and opportunities for users,” according to the blog.  Through this partnership, Sushi users and developers will have seamless access to the entire $300 billion market value of the Ethereum and Cosmos blockchains from a single network, which Kava says is for the first time.  The Kava Rise fund launched in early March. It is expected to distribute 62.5% of all block rewards to developers building on the Kava Ethereum and Cosmos co-chains to support the growth of DeFi, play-to-earn blockchain games (GameFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT).  The Kava Network will be one of the first chains to provide Sushi incentives beyond the Ethereum mainnet and into the Cosmos ecosystem, according to the blog post.  Kava is built on Cosmos SDK – a framework for building public proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains – and aims to combine the Ethereum and Cosmos chains into a single network. This allows developers to build and deploy applications on a single chain that is accessible to users and assets of both Ethereum and Cosmos.  Sushi is a multichain decentralized finance platform that started out as a fork of Ethereum-based decentralized exchange Uniswap but quickly became one of the few “blue chip” DeFi assets in mid-2020.  On March 9, Kava added Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contract support of its Ethereum Co-Chain, which allows Ethereum developers to deploy decentralized applications (dapps) to Cosmos.

Being the company behind XRP, the sixth biggest crypto in the world, and a cryptocurrency exchange network that can process transactions globally, Ripple&apos;s legal battle with the SEC has become the most closely watched legal battle in the crypto world. According to the complaint filed by the SEC, Ripple obtained funds by selling XRP to investors in the United States and around the world in an unregistered offering of securities. In other words, since the company is behind the sales of $1.3 billion of XRP to retail investors, the transaction must have been filed with the SEC as a public offering of securities to comply with regulations governing such deals.

This calls for caution for investors who are buying such high volatile altcoins or tokens.

Some projects are launched by fake teams. They aim to get added to top cryptocurrency monitoring platforms, such as CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and Nomics. Consequently, these unverified teams pump liquidity into them. After the token has liquidity, you must check the profiles of the listed team members and advisors on professional platforms like LinkedIn. If the listed team members have not posted about the project on their profiles or job histories, the project could be a scam.

In decentralized exchanges, funds are not controlled by a central wallet. Users&apos; funds are not accountable to the exchange since they are not custodians of the funds. In most cases, users&apos; web wallets or app extensions are used to enable decentralized exchange protocols. According to CoinMarketCap, 526 cryptocurrency exchanges are listed at the time of writing. 217 of these are decentralized exchanges. Thus, only 41.25 % of the cryptocurrency exchanges currently listed on CoinMarketCap are decentralized exchanges. Uniswap (V2) is the largest decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, with a 24-hour trading volume of about $1.09 billion. In contrast, Binance&apos;s exchange executed over $9.73 billion in the last 24 hours. Uniswap (V2), Pancakeswap, dYdX, Kine Protocol, Honeyswap, and Curve Finance are some of the prominent decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. The decentralized exchanges with the lowest ranking are SashimiSwap, MOV, BEPswap, Demex, IDEX BSC, and Unifi Protocol DAO. Some of the pros of decentralized crypto exchanges include no regulation, low transaction fees, no account bans, and more trading options.

More precisely, it is still happening. However, there are notes of its completion or at least suspension. Since May 2021, sellers have managed to lower the LINK price by almost 90%. Thus, the LINK price reached the price level in July 2020. The $7 range was the main liquidity zone during 2020. Buyers stayed above the $7 mark for six months to continue the growth wave. https://www.tradingview.com/x/epl0SvTl/ Therefore, the $50 test is a merit of a successful fight in the $7 range. We have understood the importance of this range. Now about the growth prospects. In the weekly timeframe, we see that sellers has significantly reduced the dynamics of the fall since 9 May. Three weeks of sluggish decline gave buyers a chance to bounce. The weekly candle from 30 May signals a rebound of the LINK price to $14. This target is quite real in the perspective of month two. The most important thing is that this target does not destroy the structure of the LINK fall wave. This growth wave will be the first step of buyers to the global reversal of LINK price. So far, we do not expect uncorrected growth above $14. However, if after the $14 test, buyers will be able to keep the $7.6 range without updating the local low, we will recommend buying LINK in the medium to long term.

During this time, the FTT price fell by almost 50%. However, sellers failed to update local lows from May to June 2021. For example, the Bitcoin price updated local lows, although this happened in the form of a false breakdown. Thus, the FTT price has not yet reached even the liquidity zone of $23.6. It is from this liquidity zone that you can invest in low-risk FTT with a global target of $52.77. From this point, a new local fall wave may begin, which is likely to overwhelm the bottom line of the global growth channel. This channel of growth is controlled by buyers from March 2020. https://www.tradingview.com/x/NUJ8nyzW/ Only after buyers prove their strength and maintain this trend line can we expect the formation of a new growth wave with the historical high update.

First implemented into the Bitcoin mainnet in 2018 to address Bitcoin&apos;s infamous scalability issues, the Lightning Network has ever since been able to maintain an upward trajectory in terms of expanding its capacity.

Run by a network of nodes that process payments, the transactions are commonly made using QR codes, instead of complex public keys which allows for faster payments, with lower fees.

42421540,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXocX7,1653904225,Letters to Layer 2: We Still Know Nothing About the Metaverse,"Last week, CoinDesk’s digital magazine, Layer 2, published a comprehensive series on the metaverse. The features, essays and op-eds covered what the metaverse is, what it means for crypto and how to profit from, in and around this next-gen web.  In short, the metaverse is (conceivably) the next frontier for the internet. It seeks to create embodied experiences and that will push many parts of the web as we know it to their limits.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. And it is a part of Layer 2's “Metaverse Week.""  We won’t just have social media, but very social media. “Holding” crypto could take on a literal meaning. Our online identities would have substance and form, and might, therefore, be treated with a higher level of respect than we currently give our avatars and usernames.  All of this, it goes without saying, has relevance for digital privacy, digital rights and digital assets. The internet today, and especially the subset carved out by the crypto industry, is largely synthetic. We don’t yet know the full repercussions of what making the virtual a little more life-like could be; just as it was difficult to predict how the World Wide Web would impact society back in Tim Berners-Lee’s day.  See also: The New Ways of Making Money in the Metaverse | Opinion  Suffice to say, these changes if they come in even half the measure as predicted, would be profound. And, as thorough as Metaverse Week was, there are still unanswered questions.  A few experts wrote in and shared their thoughts on some of the biggest issues remaining. They cover the creator economy, tribalism and the real costs associated with the metaverse – and maybe show how little we know.  Will there be one metaverse or many? (And why might one be better than the other?)  As my lawyer always says: “It depends.” Is there a single internet, or are there multiple internets? As an English speaker, I’ve always enjoyed a very large slice of the internet. However, I never appreciated that until I moved to Japan in 2019 and found that the Japanese-language internet is much smaller. Search for the same query in Japanese, and you’ll get many fewer hits, due to the simple fact that there is much less published content on the web in Japanese than in English.  In much the same way, “the metaverse” can be used to refer to the wider phenomenon of spending time in virtual worlds. However, humans are inherently tribal. Even if a single implementation of the metaverse becomes mainstream, we’ll find ways to divide it into mini-metaverses that serve our gathering needs. This is neither a good nor a bad thing – it’s simply part of being human.  – Grace “Ori” Kwan, co-founder of Orca  Will the metaverse be expensive to use?  There will be enormous variation in the cost of participating in the metaverse just as there is in the global economy currently. Similar to how there is intense competition among brands for the real estate and eyeballs in Times Square in New York City, there will be comparable levels of competition in the most sought-after metaverse realms for both digital real estate and attention.  Brands will be dedicating significant percentages of resources towards gaining and retaining customers in the metaverse and, as part of that competition, brands will vie to offer the best metaverse experience at the most affordable price.  This market pressure should keep metaverse experiences affordable for the majority of users. That said, experiences will run the gamut between low-cost to free and extremely expensive and exclusive, just as brands in Web 2 choose different tactics, with some marketing to a mass market at affordable prices while others cater to small, niche groups who can pay more for customized, luxury experiences. As the metaverse matures, expect this level of variation in branded experiences to develop.  – Yonathan Lapchik, CEO of SUKU  If you could shop or socialize from anywhere, would you leave your home?  Today, the internet makes shopping more efficient because it’s quicker and cheaper than going into a store. The trade-off is in losing visual and tactile experiences, and the sensation of being in a crowd or a shared sense of reality and place. In bringing us theoretically close to anyone else online, today’s internet simultaneously disconnects us from our family and friends. The metaverse will reconstruct the web from a flat two-dimensional experience into an immersive, interactive three-dimensional experience that resembles a massive multiplayer video game like Fortnite.  When shopping, for instance, instead of scrolling through a digital catalog to buy your groceries you will enter a supermarket with an avatar representing your identity. That avatar will push a digital cart down the aisles as you pick up food items, examine them and deposit them in your cart. This is closer to the real-world experience of shopping that is threatened with extinction by Web 2’s convenience – with the added benefit of the internet’s ubiquity and choice.  In other words, the metaverse might allow us to reclaim our past while still preserving the efficiencies of going digital. As for our friends, family and those we want close to us: You’ll be able to invite anyone into your virtual home and offer a curated experience, sharing your life in an immersive format that mimics someone visiting your offline reality.  See also: What Happens When You Die in the Metaverse? | Opinion  There are clear benefits of the metaverse’s community-based ownership and governance models as well as its trustless transactions and transparency. It reproduces the physicality lacking in the web, and allows for more attuned social experiences. Still, if you could experience reality virtually, why would you leave your home?  – Dan Nissanoff, CEO of Game of Silks  Creators will be central to the metaverse  Right now, the metaverse consists of several open-world games. Unlike traditional games, users fully own the in-game assets they earn or purchase. Yet, most of these assets are predesigned by the game’s developers. It doesn’t have to be this way, and in fact if this trend continues it would choke the metaverse before it begins.  The name “user-generated content” is as it suggests. Today it usually refers to YouTube videos, fan fiction, game mods for Grand Theft Auto, Roblox and Minecraft – or content that was created by your average netizen rather than “professionals.” In the context of the metaverse, we’re really talking about in-game assets – the characters, worlds and tools you use as you play.  Companies like Meta and Riot Games have already started experimenting with user-generated content in their metaverses, and the results have been promising. But what’s really interesting, if the metaverse is to be as interactive, immersive and experiential as professed, the world cannot rely only on companies to flesh it out. The metaverse simply wouldn’t “scale.”  What will likely encourage players to build on their own in-game assets (clothes, levels, maps, etc.) is the level of guaranteed ownership and potential to profit. Today, mods can be monetized but that often breaks the rules and players often seem more motivated by prestige among their peers for building cool stuff.  So it is that the metaverse presents a contradiction: In the absence of UGC, the metaverse would be nothing more than a static environment where people could look but not interact (like watching a movie). So this stuff is necessary. And because blockchain will give these assets a market and permanence, there will be motivated players to build. The hope is that user-generated content will foster creativity and innovation by allowing like-minded individuals to engage with each other. But might market competition look a little more familiar, instead?  – Simon Viera, co-founder and CEO of MixMob  The mental health implications of the metaverse  In general, those struggling with issues such as social anxiety or agoraphobia can experience, maybe for the first time in a long time, some sustained social engagement through the metaverse. As they edge themselves into an inclusive world where they can feel present and comfortable, barriers such as fear of judgment could slowly begin to dissipate. This, in due time, could encourage them in their ability to hold conversations and comfortably immerse themselves in new environments within the physical world.  Similarly, those who experience loneliness – such as individuals who live in remote locations – could potentially feel more socially included by entering the metaverse as they will have the opportunity to meet with people from all walks of life and connect with others who share similar passions and interests. The metaverse breaks geographic boundaries.  The physically disabled could likewise benefit. In the metaverse some stand to gain a whole new sense of motion and interaction, offering a real sense of liberation as they explore new environments. With virtual reality, they can travel to exotic destinations such as beaches and rainforests, or visit different cities and monuments, all from the comfort of their home.  See also: Happiness 3.0: A Mission for Mental Health in the Metaverse | Opinion  There could be dedicated “islands” or “planets” – or digital worlds – developed as mental health sanctuaries, where users can go to experience therapy services, mindfulness classes and exercise programs. For those who may lack the confidence or the resources to venture into these avenues in the physical world, the metaverse presents a very feasible alternative.  This sense of freedom from physical limitations spans all aspects of identity. On a vast scale, people will be able to recreate themselves and be anything they want to be – no matter their race, gender or size. This should not discourage people from being who they are in the physical world, but rather encourage them to extend the scope of who they imagine themselves to be – maybe igniting something that would otherwise lay dormant within.  – Jawad Ashraf, CEO of Terra Virtua  More from Metaverse Week:  A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse  Verifiable, immutable ownership of digital goods and currency will be an essential component of the metaverse.

42423243,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2XUVh,1653903066,Bitcoin Shows Signs of Bottoming Out After 9 Weeks of Losses,"Bitcoin (BTC) added 5.6% in the past 24 hours to rise over $30,000 during Asian trading hours on Monday in a brief show of strength amid a record losing streak, data shows.  The asset has slid for nine straight weeks for the first time in its history, falling from the $48,160 level in late March to last week’s close of $29,600. The drop came alongside inflation concerns in the broader economy, a move away from risk assets, and systemic risk from within the crypto industry.  Price-charts suggest bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, saw strong support at the $29,000 mark, a level that has been tested several times in the past weeks. Closing below this level could mean the cryptocurrency could drop to its 2017 high of nearly $20,000, charts show. Resistance at $30,500 continues to exist, however, and a daily close above that level would show strong signs of recovery.  Readings on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) – a tool used by traders to calculate the magnitude of an asset’s price move – have fallen to nearly 30, suggesting signs of bottoming out. Short-term buyers could add to this week’s momentum. Sentiment data from last week already suggests the market may be headed for higher prices in the coming weeks.  Some analysts have said that investors would continue to assess price action before deploying capital.  “U.S. markets saw a modest revival last week with stocks rising across the board,” Simon Peters, market analyst at eToro, said in an email. “Although crypto didn’t see quite the same revival, prices have now been holding steady in major cryptos such as bitcoin, suggesting a ‘calm’ of sorts before any fresh commitment to the market is made by large players.”  Monday’s run comes on the back of a bump in Asian equities amid reports that major Chinese cities have started to ease coronavirus restrictions after months of strict lockdowns. Traders laid bets that the reopening the economy could spark an increase in consumer spending – which could increase company revenues in the coming weeks and could indicate a bottom for stocks in the region.  The Asia Dow index rose 2.15%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index added 2.06% on Monday. Japan’s Nikkei 225 bumped 2.19%, with European indices such as Stoxx 600 and DAX adding at least 0.82% since Monday’s start. Futures in the U.S. rose, as Nasdaq 100 jumped 1.44% while S&P500 added 1.08%.  However, some analysts say a recovery in bitcoin could take longer than expected.  “It will be premature to talk about a bullish counteroffensive until bitcoin gets above $30,600, its horizontal resistance line since mid-May,” explained Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst. “Renewed risk appetite in global markets is fueling hopes of a turnaround.”  “Divergence in equity and cryptocurrency dynamics was conspicuous last week, highlighting the weakness of the crypto market,” Kuptsikevich cautioned.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/30/bitcoin-shows-signs-of-bottoming-out-after-9-weeks-of-losses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/606f6bccb114ca502ef809a2ad0d272c32193a03-2354x1282.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
