Crypto Asset Management, which was founded last year and has roughly $20 million in assets under management, saw its CAMCrypto30 cryptocurrency index fall by 69 percent since its high in January. Enneking, writing in a recent investor newsletter, sees four reasons for the collapse.  Asset consolidation, regulatory concerns, massive liquidation by the Mt. Gox trustee and startups' selling crypto assets to pay salaries and expenses are all factors in the market's overall decline, he wrote.  ""Consolidation after the amazing 2017 increase"" drew back some of the funds invested in cryptocurrencies, he said.  Invsestors are also likely wary due to recent regulatory actions. While he did not cite any specific events, the report comes just weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed startups with initial coin offerings.  It remains unclear what exactly the SEC is looking for, though an official confirmed ""dozens"" of investigations were underway.  The other two reasons likely had less of an impact, Enneking said.  These factors have mostly been priced into the cryptocurrency market already, which, despite the recent rout, is still up by over 600 percent in the last 15 months, he wrote.  Enneking also noted that bitcoin's share of the overall cryptocurrency market has fallen from 45.7 percent on Dec. 20 to 44.3 percent. This decline in ""BTC dominance"" has coincided with a decline in correlation between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, he wrote.  While the note does not comment on what declining correlation means, it could indicate that the quality of individual cryptocurrencies is beginning to have a greater influence on their market prices.  The combination of these factors indicate that the market should begin rebounding soon, he indicated in his report.

The U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre, the technology wing of the Government Communications Headquarters, highlighted cryptojacking as a ""significant"" concern in its latest ""cyber threat to UK business"" report.  In particular, the report singled out websites which mined cryptocurrencies without users' permission, noting that 55 percent of businesses worldwide suffered from cryptomining attacks last December. The report specifically referred to monero, which has frequently been mined through browser application Coinhive, as one example.  Nor have the attacks waned in 2018. The report noted that more than 4,000 websites secretly mined a cryptocurrency using a plugin for visually-impaired users. The report noted that ""the only way users may notice their devices are being cryptojacked is a slight slowdown in performance.""  The document continued:  ""The technique of delivering cryptocurrency miners through malware has been used for several years, but it is likely in 2018-19 that one of the main threats will be a newer technique of mining cryptocurrency which exploits visitors to a website.""  The agency added that ""we assume the majority of cryptojacking is carried out by cyber criminals, but website owners have also targeted visitors to their website and used the processing power of visitors’ CPUs, without their knowledge or consent, to mine cryptocurrency for their own financial gain.""  That being said, some sites may mine cryptocurrencies with their users' permission, the report noted, citing Salon as an example. The publication announced in February that it would let its readers choose between advertisements and cryptocurrency mining in order to access its content, as previously reported. However, the report noted that this was only a trial.  The report advised users to use ad blockers and anti-virus programs which include browser mining blocks to prevent their computers from being hijacked.

Roughly 137 individuals were investigated, and the suspects used a total of 174 bank accounts, according to the statement, which continued:  ""The criminals based in Spain were contacted by drug traffickers to launder money obtained from their illegal activities.

With the cash ""circulating in the financial system"" the alleged criminals first used credit cards to withdraw the money in Colombia, but fearing discovery, they subsequently shifted to converting the funds into cryptocurrency and then into Colombian pesos through the Finnish crypto exchange.

In a speech  Tuesday, European Commission (EC) vice president Andrus Ansip went so far as to highlight distributed ledger tech, calling it one of ""the areas where Europe is best positioned to play a leading role,"" with the caveat that the continent needs to invest much more in its technology sector.  During his opening remarks issued at the EC's Digital Day 2018 in Brussels, he further asked the EU to ""commit to Europe's digital and data-based future.""  He told attendees:  ""[Blockchain is] now moving out of the lab and going mainstream. As with [artificial intelligence]: we should make the most of this new opportunity to innovate.""  Ansip mentioned the EU's investment in blockchain, as well as in artificial intelligence and digital healthcare, the conference's other focus areas, and he made it clear that he believe the EU cannot provide sufficient funding on its own.  ""We need hard cash,"" he said, imploring governments and the private sector to increase investments in Europe's tech sector.  Ansip's remarks come two months after the EC took a larger role in encouraging blockchain research.  In February, the commission launched the EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum in partnership with the ethereum startup ConsenSys, an effort it said Monday would invest €300 million in blockchain-related projects.  Further, the EC announced that it will form a European Blockchain Partnership to ""promote interoperable infrastructures,"" though no further details are available at this time.  More broadly, Ansip positioned the EU's investments in blockchain and other emerging technologies in the context of the Digital Single Market, with the goal of extending the EU's uniform regulatory structure to the technology sector.  Part of this push for standardization is the General Data Protection Regulation, which will govern the treatment of EU citizens' personal data beginning in May.

The National Institution for Transforming India, known as NITI Aayog, aims to have a proof-of-concept (PoC) of the solution completed by the end of 2018 and begin rolling it out next year, according to local news source Factor Daily,  An anonymous NITI Aayog official was cited as saying:  ""We are all taking those [fake] medicines and I am sure people are dying. One way to reduce that is put the entire supply chain on the blockchain.""  According to a World Health Organisation (WHO) report, India produces 35 percent of counterfeit drugs that are sold globally. Furthermore, the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham), states that around ""60–70 percent of dietary supplements being sold across India are fake, counterfeit, unregistered and unapproved.""  NITI Aayog hopes to counter this state of affairs by generating a unique ID number for each medicine, which will be tracked through the supply chain on a blockchain, the official explained. With the system, a consumer or business can access the history and source of the drug by scanning a QR code or barcode on the medicine.  The project has reportedly got the green light from the country's pharmaceutical industry, despite some cost concerns.  Dilip G. Shah, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, a lobby group, said:  ""Fake drugs are a concern and, if blockchain can help the industry get rid of the problem, we are up for it.""  The project is also in line with the Indian governments' vision to explore blockchain technology ""for ushering in [a] digital economy,"" as stated by the country's finance minister Arun Jaitley during his budget speech in February.

42401421,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbiV1,1523368817,Below $400: 'Death Cross' Hits Ether But Damage May Be Done,"Like bitcoin at the close of March, ethereum's ether token has been hit with a ""death cross"" indicator today.  The scary-sounding death cross occurs when the 50-day moving average (MA) crosses the 200-day MA from above.  However, it's worth noting that the 200-day MA includes almost one-year-old data, while the 50-day MA marks data that goes back close to three months. So, such events tend to lag the trend by at least three months.  For instance, ether (ETH) topped out at a record high of $1,424 on Jan. 13, according to Bitfinex data. As of writing, ether is changing hands at $399 on Bitfinex – down 72 percent from the all-time high. So, the sell-off has already taken place and today's death cross effectively indicates the bear market is three months old.  Hence, it should come as no surprise if ether bottoms out now the death cross has been confirmed. Further, it's likely no coincidence that the sell-off ran out of steam around $360 just a few days ago.  Daily chart  ETH attempted to form a double bottom breakout on Monday, having formed a base around $360 since the end of March. However, the influence of a sell-off in bitcoin made sure the cryptocurrency closed (as per UTC) well below the neckline resistance of $418.  ETH has also formed a doji candle at the neckline hurdle, indicating indecision in the marketplace.  Nevertheless, the relative strength index has cleared the descending trendline hurdle and has risen from the oversold territory (to back above 30.00), suggesting scope for a double-bottom breakout.  View  A close above $418 (neckline hurdle) would confirm a double-bottom breakout (short-term bullish reversal) and open the doors for a rally to $475.  Bearish case: A close below $358, if accompanied by a BTC sell-off, could yield a drop to $300.

42401405,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbiGG,1523365205,Crypto Portfolio Tracker Raises $1.5 Million in Funding,"Cryptocurrency investment management startup CoinTracker has raised $1.5 million in seed funding from some heavyweight investors, the firm announced on Tuesday.  Backed by seed accelerator Y Combinator, the round was spearheaded by Initialized Capital – an early Coinbase investor that was in part established by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.  Protocol Labs founder and FileCoin creator Juan Benet and Gmail creator Paul Buchheit also notably took part in the round.  CoinTracker  co-founder Chandan Lodha told CoinDesk that the company's core premise is to ""make crypto more accessible, easier to use and simpler for a mainstream audience.""  ""I think one of things that appeals to some of the folks that are in the round is that we're taking this not well understood and confusing and complicated space and just making it super easy so that anyone interested in the space could get involved,"" he told CoinDesk.  Order out of chaos  In the interview, Lodha said that the company was born out of his and co-founder Jon Lerner's frustration with tracking their crypto investments. The ex-Google employees initially tried to use a spreadsheet to keep track of their investments, logging each transaction manually.  ""That works fine for the first 10 trades or when you have a very simple transaction history,"" he said, ""but, over time, you start doing more trades or start having more exchanges or more coins – it gets very out of control.""  The team then added API integration and Google apps scripts, which Lodha described as a ""really heavyweight hack-y solution"" for what seemed like a simple problem.  This ""pain point"" prompted Lodha and Lerner to develop a simpler front-end for the product, which eventually evolved into ""a simple dashboard for a unified interface of all your crypto assets.""  Lodha explained:  ""The initial differentiator that got us some early traction was that instead of people having to manually enter in each trade one at a time, we synchronized the different exchanges and wallets that people have. So they just connect them once, and then it pulls in all of their transaction history retroactively and going forward, and then they could see how their [investment] performance was going without having to do anything.""  Taxing issue  Most recently, CoinTracker introduced a tax feature to further simply crypto investors' experience. The new tool ""parses all the different trades and transactions you have and actually outputs a filled-out IRS Form 8949,"" Lodha said.  ""It saves people a lot of hassle,"" he added.  Lodha and Lerner don't intend to stop at taxes and have plans to take on other aspects of the crypto space that are currently inaccessible.  ""We started by dealing with tracking and taxes and making that super easy, but hopefully over time we can do that to other areas as well,"" Lodha said.  The co-founders plan to use their seed funding to realize this goal, first by expanding their team to include more full-stack developers.  ""There are obviously many areas of crypto that are very confusing and complicated,"" Lodha said. ""I really don't like that it comes across as such a complicated and inaccessible space.""

42401414,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbiO8,1523363411,Golem Arrives: One of Ethereum's Most Ambitious Apps Is Finally Live,"Wouldn't it be nice to make some extra cash while browsing social media?  That's the promise of Golem, a peer-to-peer market for putting your computer's excess CPU power to use for other people. And today, after three years and 14 software implementations later, it's going live on the ethereum blockchain.  The project, which sold out of its GNT token in 20 minutes, raising 820,000 ETH – around $340 million, according to current metrics – in 2016 by selling its crypto utility tokens to investors will likely see a significant amount of fanfare since Golem was one of the earliest generations of ethereum applications.  But it has also received some amount of criticism for its failure to turn around a product relatively quickly.  “This is typical for software development in general, and blockchain in particular, we underestimate the complexity of what we want to do,"" Julian Zawistowski, CEO and founder of Golem, told CoinDesk. ""You always underestimate how difficult it is, and this was obviously the case with us.”  That said, even though the project is still far from its goal of building a worldwide supercomputer, the mainnet launch is an important step forward in proving out its underlying architecture and ethereum itself.  In its current format, the service enables computers to rent unused CPU power for creating computer-generated imagery (CGI) using Blender, an open-source software for animated films, visual effects, interactive 3D applications and video games. It works by swapping computational power for GNT through an interface that connects to Blender directly.  And this current release, Golem Brass Beta, is an effort to test whether the technology functions in real market conditions with real money. “We have to see how it behaves in the wild,” Zawistowski said.  CTO and co-founder of the company, Piotr “Viggith"" Janiuk, told CoinDesk:  “The release is there to prove to us and everyone that we can actually deliver something that can run on mainnet and that’s really usable. And well, it is.""  Big ambitions  As such, Golem today works through a software client, which connects the two parties in Golem’s network – “providers,"" those that sell computational resources, and “requestors,"" those that want to rent CPU power.  The providers are given small tasks, or “subtasks,"" which went pieced together, create a full computational picture.  “We send those subtasks over a peer-to-peer network where peers compute them, return the results for you and connect that into one piece and pay for the use of the other peoples' computers,” Zawistowski said.  Zawistowski explained that all interactions happen directly between nodes on the network. While it’s not built on a blockchain itself, Golem uses ethereum not only for its token, GNT, and for consensus on GNT transactions.  For now, the primary function of the mainnet release is to test the economic assumptions of the network, as well as appealing to early adopters for feedback on usability and issues.  “You start with a very simple Golem that should work up to a point where we have the Golem which is perfect and self-contained and modular, and you give it a computation and it’s done in a matter of seconds,"" Janiuk said.  And that future goal is first to create a dedicated plugin for Blender so that there's no extra step for using Golem's service through the application, and then, even more ambitious, allowing the network to provide computational resources for the sought-after form of artificial intelligence called machine learning.  “We definitely need to move in the direction of machine learning. This is something that is suited to Golem pretty well,” Janiuk said.  Inventing the wheel  But that will take time.  Speaking to the project's long road to production, Janiuk told CoinDesk, ""Interfacing with ethereum seems pretty straightforward, but once you want to move into production it is difficult. You have to make sure that it is as bulletproof as possible; there can be no holes because you’re risking someone else’s money.""  And what the team behind Golem found was that their aim of splitting computational tasks up into smaller tasks and then reintegrated them was an uphill battle.  The project faced with complicated and previously unresearched technical barriers.  For example, while verification – or proving that a computation is correct – is easy to achieve for simple crypto transactions, it becomes extremely difficult to develop around different kinds of computations.  On top of that, there was the issue of building on ethereum, which has seen its fair share of hurdles recently, as platform apps cause transaction backlogs and rising fees. Even ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin lamented the state of affairs on the network recently, telling an audience in Seoul, South Korea that app makers are ""screwed"" by scaling challenges.  Yet, as witnessed during CryptoKitties' peak hype, this isn't limited to Golem, but something that extends across the industry.  “Any decentralized solution right now is I believe still at least a few steps before being even close to something that can be called a production-grade solution,” Janiuk said.  And Zawistowski compared the situation to web development and infrastructure building in the 90s. While web developers today have a host of tools to choose from when building web applications, in the early days, developers had to start from scratch.  This is true of the blockchain space as well, Zawistowski said, adding:  “Very often you have to invent the wheel to solve your problems. Not reinventing the wheel, but actually inventing the wheel.”  Technician installing CPU in computer image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,ETH,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/10/golem-arrives-one-of-ethereums-most-ambitious-apps-is-finally-live,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0ba6027f3ad274e1cdc04383d7fd645ddc0e6335-2560x1709.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42401458,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbiW0,1523361657,What You Don't Know About Crypto Taxes Can Hurt You,"Steve Latham is the chairman of Claritas, a new venture that provides consolidated views of crypto holdings, gains and losses.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's Crypto and Taxes 2018 series.      The cryptocurrency bull run of 2017 was awe-inspiring. The resulting taxable implications are not.  Tax season is in full swing but there seem to be more questions than answers. As shown below, searches for “bitcoin tax” grew almost as much as crypto market caps.  With the IRS focusing on the new tax laws, there has been no new cryptocurrency tax guidance since 2014. Consequently, few investors fully understand the issues and implications of how to treat 2017 crypto gains.  “There’s a lot of confusion around taxes and cryptocurrency, and for good reason,” said Mark Steber, Chief Tax Officer and CPA at Jackson Hewitt. “Changes in tax law significantly lag the rapid growth in crypto popularity. It’s not always clear when a realized gain is taxable income, as defined by the IRS.”  With the goal of shedding light on the most important (and lesser known issues), here are some essential insights to help you navigate this tax season:  What most know  Hopefully, everyone knows taxable gains (or losses) are “realized” when you sell cryptocurrency.  If you bought 2 bitcoins at $4,000 in August and sold 1 for $14,000 in December your taxable gain is $10,000 (less commissions or fees). You realize a gain on the coin you sold. If you held it less than 12 months (short-term) the gain is taxed as ordinary income.  You don’t have to withdraw funds for the gains to be taxable. If proceeds from the sale are sitting in your Coinbase US dollar wallet, you still owe tax on the gain.  Exchanging one coin for another coin is a taxable event. If you sold 1 bitcoin (with a $4,000 cost basis) for 20 litecoins valued at $400 each ($8,000 total), you realized a $4,000 gain – just as if you had sold bitcoin for $8,000 in $US dollars.  “While traditional investment gains and losses typically easy to track and report, cryptocurrency can be confusing,” Steber said. “For example, even when trading one coin for another, gains and losses must still be reported.”  What some know  Spending crypto is the same as selling it.  If you purchased a $14,000 car with 1 bitcoin, it’s the same as if you had sold bitcoin for $14,000 and used the proceeds to purchase the car. If your cost basis was $4,000, your gain is $10,000. The tax you’ll owe on that gain just made that car significantly more expensive.  Cryptocurrency donations are deductible! Assume you donate 10 litecoins to charity valued at $200 each ($2,000) and that your cost basis is $50 each ($500). You can deduct the greater of the market value or the cost basis without paying tax on the gain.  In this case you can book a $2,000 donation and avoid tax on the $1,500 gain. Now you can see why crypto donations exploded in 2017.  Pro tip: make sure you document the transaction so you can account for it on tax day.  What few know  To date, the IRS has not been specific about which methods are acceptable for calculating cost basis for gains and losses. That said, experts believe that when the IRS does issue guidance, it’s going to treat cryptocurrency the same as securities.  For stocks and index funds FIFO (First In, First Out) is required unless you specifically match a lot you sold to a lot you purchased (not a trivial task with crypto). Last In, First Out and Average Cost are also popular methods for accounting. But if you choose the wrong approach, it could be costly.  Why does it matter if you choose FIFO, LIFO or Average Cost? While FIFO is safer, it will result in a higher tax bill for most who bought and sold crypto in 2017.  To illustrate:  Assume you bought 1 bitcoin in September for $5,000 and 1 bitcoin in November for $10,000 ($15,000 invested with an average cost of $7,500)  If you sold 1 BTC in December for $15,000 your FIFO cost basis was $5,000, implying a gain of $10,000. Under LIFO (last in, first out) your cost basis would be $10,000, implying a gain of only $5,000. Using Average Cost, your cost and gain are $7,500.  US residents who choose LIFO or Average Cost will likely be under-reporting their 2017 tax liability. While a few loopholes may tempt some to take an aggressive approach (e.g. LIFO or Like Kind Exchange), it’s likely the IRS will require FIFO in the future – possibly with retroactive enforcement. If you choose LIFO for 2017, this could result in future payment of back-taxes, penalties, and interest.  What everyone must know  When thinking about your tax strategy, remember 3 things:  The IRS will (at some point) issue new guidance on cryptocurrency taxation  IRS rules can be retroactively enforced  IRS audits may cover the three previous years  Decisions you make today may help you (or hurt you) in the future. If you fail to report (or materially under-report) for 2017, it may come back to haunt you.  We believe it’s only a matter of time before crypto brokerages and exchanges have to report as traditional brokerages do today. On February 23, 2018, Coinbase announced it had been required to provide the IRS with information on 13,000 customers (about 0.1% of its customers). This is likely a sign of things to come for US residents who use US brokerages.  If you under-report for 2017, you may face monetary damages in the future - or worse. At a minimum you could owe back taxes, penalties, and interest. Those who severely under-report may face the risk of criminal charges for tax evasion. As ignorance will not hold up as an excuse, please talk to a tax professional.  “The best advice I can give is to work with a tax professional who understands cryptocurrency,” Mark Steber said. “It’s also a good idea to check in with your advisor throughout the year to make sure you’re not caught off-guard come tax time.”  Reporting tools  There are numerous new tools on the market (including my company's) to help you calculate taxable gains for 2017. But regardless of the tool you use, the quality of the reporting is governed by the quality of the information you enter.  For this reason, it’s critical that you take the following actions:  Include all crypto exchange accounts and digital wallets  Review all transactions – especially transfers, payments, gifts and donations – to confirm they are correctly classified.  Spot-check some of the calculations to make sure they are right. Our initial review of some of the popular tools found that accuracy varies by provider.  When in doubt, talk to a professional.  Buy time  The IRS allows residents to request an extension (for any reason) for up to six months, provided you pay your estimated taxes by April 17.  In talking with CPAs and active traders, we anticipate a spike in extensions this year as taxpayers buy time to figure out their crypto tax picture.  For more on filing extensions, please talk to your tax advisor.

At the 2018 Bo'Ao Forum for Asia in China's Hainan province on Tuesday, speakers including Chen Lei, CEO of cloud network provider Xunlei, and Li Lihui, who heads the Blockchain Research Working Group at China's National Internet Finance Association (NIFA), discussed the latest blockchain developments in China, as well as the tech's future prospects.  While 2017 saw a number of blockchain projects from technology companies in the nation, the experts on the panel argued that, further down the road, a well-thought-out regulatory framework will likely become the key driver for the technology's future growth.  To that effort, Li, who is also a former head of the Bank of China, one of the four state-owned commercial banks in the country, said developing a regulatory framework for blockchain use will be one of NIFA's top priorities in 2018.  Launched in 2015 by the People's bank of China and approved by the State Council, NIFA is a self-regulatory body that aims to ensure the healthy development of financial technology in the country.  Aside from taking a research focus on blockchain development, NIFA has also been scrutinizing the cryptocurrency industry and issued warnings on the risks associated with initial coin offerings.  Li said on the panel:  ""While blockchain's technological development has seen a major progress in China over last year with blockchain platforms launched by internet giants such as Baidu and Tencent, our regulatory initiative is substantially lagging behind.""  According to Li, his organization is eyeing a standardization framework for blockchain use and the establishment of a third-party entity as an authority to certify innovations around the tech.  ""This needs our immediate attention,"" he stated, further arguing that this direction will also facilitate fostering and recruiting talent that specializes in blockchain.  On the same subject, Xunlei's Chen Lei said: ""Technological skill is never a hindrance as the market demand will keep driving our imagination.""  Xunlei notably stepped into the blockchain space earlier this year, allowing users to earn tokens through sharing their internet bandwidth.

42401423,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbiWz,1523354413,Rangebound: Bitcoin Bulls Need Break Above $7.5K,"Bitcoin's (BTC) bulls and bears seem to be stuck in a stalemate, but a decisive session in either direction would likely define the trend going forward.  The cryptocurrency was solidly bid above $7,100 about 24 hours ago, reportedly due to speculation the Wall Street bigwigs (Soros and Rockefeller, for example) are set to enter the crypto markets. However, a long liquidation (unwinding of long bitcoin trades), as reported by WhaleCalls, looks to have pushed BTC to a low of $6,611 overnight.  At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is sitting at $6,730 on Bitfinex, representing a 6.38 percent drop from the high of $7,189 seen Monday. Despite the retreat, the immediate outlook remains neutral, with bitcoin stuck within a narrowing price range (seen in the chart below).  4-hour chart: Narrowing price range  When viewed against the backdrop of the recent slide from $9,050 (March 24 high), the triangle pattern, representing the narrowing price range, looks like a bearish continuation setup. Hence, a downside break would revive the sell-off from $9,050 and allow a drop towards $5,950 (falling wedge support).  Daily chart: Bearish outside-day candle  Amid the unwinding of the long positions mentioned above, bitcoin created a bearish outside-day candle on Monday (i.e. the price action engulfed the previous day's high and low), indicating that the corrective rally from the Friday's low of $6,500 has ended.  The candlestick pattern suggests that the cryptocurrency will likely breach the narrowing price range to the downside and extend losses towards $6,000–$5,950.  On the other hand, if bitcoin breaks out of the narrowing price range with an upside move, the odds of a falling wedge reversal (bullish pattern) would improve.  Daily chart: Potential bullish reversal  A high volume close (as per UTC) above $7,200 would confirm a bullish falling wedge reversal, however, stiff resistance is lined up at $7,510 (double bottom neckline).  As a result, traders would want to see a break above $7,510 before calling a bullish reversal. In such a scenario, prices could rise to $8,500 (target as per the measured height method).  View  Monday's bearish outside-week candle does suggest scope for a bearish breakdown. A downside break of the narrowing price range (triangle pattern) would open the doors to $6,000–$5,950 (falling wedge support). That said, traders need to watch out for signs of a rebound from the April 1 low of $6,425.  An upside breakout of the triangle pattern could see bitcoin chew through supply around $7,200, confirming a falling wedge reversal (bullish pattern) and allowing a rally to $7,500 (double bottom neckline).  Only a close above that level would confirm the short-term bullish trend reversal.

42401419,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbiS4,1523350841,China's State Electricity Firm Eyes Blockchain for Internet of Energy,"China State Grid Corporation, the country's state-owned electricity utility monopoly, is looking to blockchain technology to advance its plans for an ""Internet of Energy.""  In a patent application filed to the China State Intellectual Property Office in November last year and released last week, the energy giant has detailed its exploration of a blockchain-powered system that it claims can store and track information on, for example, consumer's power consumption, and share the data in a decentralized manner.  According to the filing, the idea behind the utility's Internet of Energy, a concept that references the internet of things, is to integrate more information about electricity consumption and generation onto the internet to facilitate data tracking on web-enabled devices.  The company explained in the application that centralizing such a system may incur higher operational costs in handling the vast amount of data, and may also bring a higher risk of security breaches. Hence, the corporation is proposing a decentralized system that can pass newly generated data through a hash function and store the results on a tamper-proof blockchain.  While the patent's concept may appear similar to the basic mechanism of the original blockchain – that of bitcoin – it comes as yet another move from a major Chinese state enterprise to explore and potentially adopt blockchain technology in advancing business operations.  As reported by CoinDesk, Sinochem, China's state-owned petrochemical giant, recently completed a trial that used blockchain technology to export gasoline from the Chinese city of Quanzhou to Singapore.  In addition, Bank of China, one of the four state-owned commercial banks, has also moved to patent a solution that it claims has the ability to solve the scaling issues that confront blockchains.

42401406,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbiFH,1523347250,Bank-Backed Hyperledger Is Slowly Opening to ICOs,"While enterprises have generally been more conservative when it comes to cryptocurrency, one of the market's key players, the Hyperledger consortium, appears to be opening its code to edgier pursuits.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk this week, the Sovrin Foundation, creator of the Hyperledger Indy codebase for digital identity management (and a Hyperledger group member since 2016), intends to become one of the first to raise money by launching a crypto token using the consortium's code this summer, effectively following through on a promise first detailed in a white paper last year.  That news may come as a surprise for those who have been following the Hyperledger consortium since it was launched under the Linux Foundation in 2015, at the time seeking to provide a repository for the many private blockchain codebases in-development at firms including IBM, State Street and more.  But running more open ICOs on the codebases under the Hyperledger umbrella has been theorized before.  Hyperledger executive director Brian Behlendorf told CoinDesk several projects are talking about launching tokens on top of the multiple codebases overseen by the group, including Sawtooth (which was contributed by Intel) and Fabric (which was contributed by IBM).  For instance, PokitDok, a healthcare API platform exploring blockchains, recently began researching launching an ERC-20 token, the ethereum standard for crypto tokens, on top of Sawtooth, Behlendorf said.  ""In theory, we could even use standards developed in the ethereum community for doing tokens on top of other ledgers,"" he continued.  And with distributed ledger consortium R3 and some of its member banks testing out Hyperledger Indy, could it be that financial institutions are ready to adopt a tool that's sometimes run afoul with global regulators?  While it's speculative at this point, Dr Phillip Windley, chair of the Sovrin Foundation, said he doesn't anticipate banks having a problem with a crypto token – not only purchasing it from Sovrin but using it to pay other banks in their network in order to facilitate a more streamlined business.  He told CoinDesk:  “I don't think banks are going to mind paying based on the fact that it's going to save them from having to do a lot of work themselves. So will the banks use a token for that? Well that is the mechanism we are given them for making payments so we hope the answer is yes.”  A market for protocols  Stepping back, Sovrin believes tokens running on an open blockchain can serve as a key ingredient to its distributed identity network, one that will offer a greater functionality than a permissioned blockchain.  Under its proposed design, any identity claim verification will cost some nominal amount (on the order of a penny or so), which will then be payable in the token. Higher value claims verifications, such as college transcript requests, would cost more and involve incentivizing the network to confirm the data.  Currently, the only option for paying for verifiable credentials is traditional payment systems, but this approach has proved cumbersome and limits the market to only the highest-value credentials.  “Tokens are a little bit of Brave New World,"" said Windley.  And they are, but a new world that Windley thinks will solve some of the incentive problems that have made centralized systems better bets than decentralized systems in the past.  ""In 10 years, we are going to look at it and it's just going to be natural for protocols to have tokens on them and for people to be talking about the incentive and disincentives of how to create the markets within which they operate,"" he said. ""Markets are one of the main ways we organize society – why would we say it's the wrong way to build technology.""  Sovrin's token will also be used to pay Sovrin stewards who validate and write data to the ledger, plus as an anti-spam measure to disincentive writing bad information to the ledger.  And despite the controversy surrounding ICOs at this time – whether it be the regulatory uncertainty or the scammy nature of many crypto tokens – Windley said that Sovrin has experienced no pushback from its partners so far.  ""All of our partners kind of nod and say, 'We get it,'"" Windley said.  'The gateway drug'  The idea of untangling digital identity has been a popular one, and it seems as if it's been making some headway recently.  For instance, Behlendorf and representatives from the Sovrin Foundation met with other digital identity specialists in Mountain View, California, last week for the talismanic gathering, the Internet Identity Workshop.  During the event, Sovrin announced that IBM is joining a group of nearly two dozen stewards of the platform.  What seems most compelling to Hyperledger's Behlendorf, though, is probing the edges of what ""permissioned"" means when it comes to blockchain innovation.  “How do we make it so that if you are a bank and you want to join a banking network, the technical ability to join the banking network is low, and the regulatory restrictions should be as simple if not simpler than we have today,"" he said. “That should be the way we judge if these networks are sufficiently transparent and sufficiently open. There will be different answers to that question.""  One of those answers could be crypto tokens, although others – like the W3C veterans who recently launched Veres One – have opposing views about the drive to ICO.  Indeed, Behlendorf and the team at Hyperledger remain ""sympathetic"" to the interest in ICOs, but don't see a future where Hyperledger itself issues a crypto token.  Still, Behlendorf is excited about pushing the notion of a “permissioned public blockchain network topology” into uncharted territory.  He told CoinDesk:  ""I sometimes joked with people on the cryptocurrency side, it may be the case that private ledgers are a gateway drug to participating in permissionless ledgers.""

According to data gathered from 17 cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan, as of Mar. 31 this year, the country has at least 3.5 million individuals that are trading with cryptocurrencies as actual assets.  Among them, crypto investors in their 20s, 30s and 40s make up a major share, accounting for 28, 34, and 22 percent, respectively, of the total crypto trader population in Japan.  Announced at the first meeting of a cryptocurrency exchange study group established by the FSA in early March, the data release marks the latest effort by the financial watchdog in bringing greater transparency to the industry following a recent hack of one of the domestic exchange Coincheck.  According to the FSA, the study and disclosure of the domestic trading statistics is a first step towards a more comprehensive examination over institutional issues in the cryptocurrency trading space in Japan.  In comparison, the financial regulator also disclosed in the latest report that the number of traders investing in cryptocurrency margins and futures is about 142,842 as of the end of March.  What's perhaps notable is the major contrast in the growth of yearly trading volume drawn to these two different types of investments.  According to the FSA's data, for example, yearly trading volume of the actual bitcoin cryptocurrency has grown from $22 million as of Mar. 31 in 2014 to $97 billion in 2017.  Yet at the same time, trading on margins, credit and futures of bitcoin as an underlying asset has surged from only $2 million in 2014 to a whopping $543 billion just in 2017 alone, the agency said.

42401404,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbiEI,1523332858,ICE CEO Won't 'Rule Out' Crypto Futures Launch,"The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) won't ""rule out"" cryptocurrency-based futures contracts.  ICE chief executive Jeffrey Sprecher discussed the issue in an interview with Bloomberg TV Monday, saying it is ""early days"" for the asset class, but that he could not ignore the idea of cryptocurrency futures contracts. He kept his comments vague, not discussing any particular cryptocurrencies or whether ICE has any definite plans to offer futures contacts based on them.  He added:  ""I wouldn't rule anything out ... There is a trend here we can’t ignore in my mind, so I don’t discount it. People put more faith in a guy named Satoshi Nakamoto that no one has ever met than they do in the U.S. Fed.""  One of ICE's subsidiaries - the New York Stock Exchange - has already entered the cryptocurrency space with an investment in crypto exchange Coinbase in 2015. The NYSE has further invested in a number of clearing houses, exchanges and marketplaces specializing in futures, options, swaps and other instruments. ICE recently announced that it would acquire the Chicago Stock Exchange.  The NYSE also filed to list bitcoin futures late last year, though no products have been approved for launch yet.  The firm's rivals CME Group and Cboe Global Markets introduced futures contracts based on bitcoin prices in December, and Nasdaq is considering following suit. It is possible that contracts based on other cryptocurrencies are in the making as well. Reports in November indicated that an unknown firm going by the name ""Virtuoso"" was developing ether futures, and Cboe's boss in December floated the idea of ether and bitcoin cash futures.  Sprecher likened the growing embrace of crytpocurrencies to other developments in tech - how, for example, New Yorkers are willing to hop into a car operating on a ride-sharing platform like Uber of Lyft, even though it hasn't undergone the type of inspections and vetting as a city-certified yellow cab.  When asked again if futures were coming, Sprecher demurred, saying ""I wouldn't rule out anything around currency.""

42401420,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbiU2,1523325654,'Bitcoin Day' Proves Crypto Is Thriving in Argentina,"Bitcoin may not yet have ""conquered"" Argentina, but it's certainly making in-roads.  That much was obvious last week at ""Bitcoin Day"" in Buenos Aires, where 500 attendees took part in an event aimed at serving a growing demand for information on the technology. Held in the heart of the city's Almagro neighborhood, the conference served a reminder of how the country is still the leader in regional adoption, even if other developments in Latin America (like Venezuela's possible petro cryptocurrency) may have stolen the spotlight of late.  For example, Chile's Guillermo Torrealba, CEO of the cryptocurrency services firm Buda, contrasted his efforts to achieve banking support in Argentina with experiences elsewhere.  “There are even banks here that have executives that are exclusively dedicated to cryptocurrency companies,"" Torrealba said. Compared with his home country, the situation, he said, is night and day.  “In Chile last week, all commercial banks have decided to close the accounts to all the cryptocurrency companies at the same time. They killed the industry,"" he told CoinDesk.  Still, that's not to say there isn't optimism that other countries will follow in Argentina's progressive footsteps.  Torrealba expects government or judicial intervention to ultimately end the blockade, asserting that countries like Peru are already pursuing a different strategy, seeking to observe and learn.  “We believe that it is not long before the traditional financial industry will come looking for us in order to begin to use our infrastructure,” he said.  But in Argentina, that might already be happening.  Gonzalo Blousson, CEO of digital notary startup Signatura, for one, acknowledged progress is being made. Already, Argentina is registering official bulletins on the blockchain, a development he credits to a vibrant local community that has been evangelizing for the tech for years.  He told CoinDesk:  “We used to call the companies to tell them what blockchain is about. Today they call us to improve their processes.”  The new enemy  That said, there was a significant amount of interest in another question – if and when the bitcoin price (down more than 60 percent on the year) would begin to rise again.  For this, a talk by Carlos Maslaton, head of treasury at Xapo, satisfied, with dialogue on how financial entities are wary of bitcoin because it ""generates competition"" in the financial markets.  But he notably went on to urge banks to “open their minds a little,"" suggesting that the crowd in attendance was reason enough that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are, if nothing else, a new market for their services. (Maslaton said he wasn’t expecting such a strong turnout after the decrease of bitcoin price.)  Still, if Maslaton doesn't see banks as the enemy, he believes bitcoin still has regional threats.  Asked by a Venezuelan about his opinion on the petro cryptocurrency, he went so far as to call it a ""fraud.""  ""No currency of these characteristics can be issued by a government. Precisely the idea of cryptocurrencies is that it they are not to be issued by a government,"" he said, adding:  “In the hands of Maduro and the criminals who run Venezuela, what else can I say...”  Images via Bitcoin Day organizers",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Belen Marty,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/10/bitcoin-day-proves-crypto-is-thriving-in-argentina,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e761492b5f8cb6d716d36009f89c79e4b3cb5511-2560x1703.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42401413,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbiMA,1523318458,Gemini to Roll Out Bitcoin and Ether Block Trading,"Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini said Monday that it will roll out block trading for bitcoin and ether starting later this week.  The feature – which will allow customers to make high-volume trades that won't appear in the exchange's order book until they've been filled – will go live at 9:30 a.m. ET on Thursday, Gemini explained in a blog post. There's a minimum threshold of 10 bitcoin or 100 ether for the block trades, meaning that smaller traders won't be able to use the feature.  Gemini has positioned the block trading addition as a way to create ""an additional mechanism to source liquidity when trading in greater size.""  Block trading allows large traders such as hedge funds to buy or sell large quantities without having large immediate effects on the price. The alternative is to place over-the-counter trades, which happen outside of exchanges, or to split trades up into smaller chunks in order to minimize the impact to supply and demand.  Market takers – who place the orders – specify whether the trade is a buy or sell; the minimum quantity; and a price limit. This information, called an indication of interest, is broadcast to all market makers simultaneously.  ""In accordance with our commitment to an equitable, transparent, and rules-based marketplace, block orders will be electronically broadcast to participating market makers simultaneously, ensuring best execution and price discovery for those participating in the program,"" the exchange explained in its blog post.  Gemini, founded by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, had indicated last month that the exchange may move to add additional cryptocurrencies for trading in the future. Potential selections include bitcoin cash and litecoin, as reported at the time.
